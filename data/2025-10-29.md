### [1] [TRELLISWorld: Training-Free World Generation from Object Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23880)
*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的3D场景生成方法，通过将通用文本到3D对象扩散模型重新用作模块化瓦片生成器，将场景生成重新表述为多瓦片去噪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于单对象生成、需要领域特定训练或缺乏360度全视角支持，无法满足通用3D场景生成需求。

Method: 将场景生成重新表述为多瓦片去噪问题，独立生成重叠的3D区域并通过加权平均无缝融合，实现可扩展的大场景合成。

Result: 支持多样化场景布局、高效生成和灵活编辑，建立了通用语言驱动3D场景构建的简单而强大的基础。

Conclusion: 该方法无需场景级数据集或重新训练，依赖最少启发式方法，继承了对象级先验的泛化能力，为通用3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [2] [Fast and accurate neural reflectance transformation imaging through knowledge distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24486)
*Tinsae G. Dulecha,Leonardo Righetto,Ruggero Pintus,Enrico Gobbetti,Andrea Giachetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DisK-NeuralRTI方法，通过知识蒸馏降低NeuralRTI的计算成本，解决传统RTI方法在复杂反射场捕获上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RTI方法（如PTM和HSH）使用固定基函数和少量系数，难以准确捕获复杂反射场，特别是在高反射或阴影区域会产生伪影。NeuralRTI虽然质量更好，但解码器网络参数多，渲染计算成本高，在有限硬件上无法处理大尺寸图像。

Method: 提出基于知识蒸馏的DisK-NeuralRTI方法，通过训练更小的学生网络来模拟大型教师网络（NeuralRTI）的行为，从而降低计算成本。

Result: 该方法在保持NeuralRTI高质量的同时，显著降低了计算成本，使得在有限硬件上也能进行全分辨率交互式重光照。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是降低NeuralRTI计算成本的有效方法，解决了之前直接训练小网络失败的问题，为RTI技术在实际应用中的推广提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

### [3] [Explainable Detection of AI-Generated Images with Artifact Localization Using Faster-Than-Lies and Vision-Language Models for Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23775)
*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed,Pushti Amit Vasoya,Simeon Kandan Sonar,Yasir Z,Madesh Kuppusamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的图像真实性检测系统，结合轻量级卷积分类器和视觉语言模型，在32x32低分辨率图像上实现96.5%的准确率，并能定位和解释视觉伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的真实性日益增强，给视觉真实性验证带来挑战，需要开发可解释的检测系统。

Method: 使用轻量级卷积分类器(Faster-Than-Lies)与视觉语言模型(Qwen2-VL-7B)相结合，通过自编码器重建误差图生成伪影定位热图，并将70种视觉伪影分为8个语义组。

Result: 在扩展的CiFAKE数据集上达到96.5%准确率，在8核CPU上推理时间为175ms，能生成可解释的文本描述检测到的异常。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了结合视觉和语言推理在低分辨率图像中进行可解释真实性检测的可行性，在取证、工业检测和社交媒体审核等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [4] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer是一个基于transformer的类无关物体计数框架，通过识别视觉重复和结构关系来实现类似人类的计数能力，在复杂形状和密集场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计数模型在处理复杂形状、内部对称或重叠物体时容易出错，无法像人类那样通过感知视觉重复和结构关系来计数。

Method: 基于CounTR架构，用自监督基础模型DINOv2替换视觉编码器，引入位置嵌入融合来保持几何关系，通过轻量卷积解码器将特征解码为密度图。

Result: 在FSC-147数据集上达到与当前SOTA方法相当的性能，在结构复杂或密集场景中表现出更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 集成DINOv2等基础模型使计数系统能够接近人类的结构感知能力，向真正通用且无需示例的计数范式迈进。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

### [5] [A geometric and deep learning reproducible pipeline for monitoring floating anthropogenic debris in urban rivers using in situ cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23798)
*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Clément Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于固定摄像头的深度学习框架，用于河流漂浮垃圾的连续监测和量化，包括最佳模型选择和几何尺寸估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 河流漂浮人造垃圾对生物多样性、水质和人类活动造成负面影响，需要有效的监测方法。

Method: 使用固定原位摄像头，结合深度学习模型进行垃圾检测，并利用投影几何和回归校正进行物体尺寸估计。

Result: 验证了不同环境条件下模型的性能，强调了数据集构建协议的重要性，特别是负样本整合和时间泄漏考虑。

Conclusion: 证明了结合投影几何和回归校正的度量物体估计方法的可行性，为开发低成本自动化城市水环境监测系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

### [6] [RareFlow: Physics-Aware Flow-Matching for Cross-Sensor Super-Resolution of Rare-Earth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23816)
*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareFlow是一个物理感知的遥感图像超分辨率框架，通过双条件架构和不确定性量化，在分布外条件下实现高保真重建，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像超分辨率在分布外条件下（如不同传感器捕获的罕见地貌特征）往往产生视觉合理但物理不准确的结果，需要解决这一鲁棒性问题。

Method: 采用双条件架构：门控ControlNet保持低分辨率输入的几何保真度，文本提示提供语义指导；引入多面损失函数确保光谱和辐射一致性；使用随机前向传播量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在盲评估中，地球物理专家认为模型输出接近真实图像保真度，显著优于最先进基线；感知指标定量提升，FID降低近40%。

Conclusion: RareFlow为数据稀缺科学领域提供了高保真合成的鲁棒框架，并为严重域偏移下的可控生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

### [7] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LHT-CLIP是一个无需训练的新框架，通过利用CLIP在层、头和令牌级别的视觉区分能力来改进语义分割性能，无需额外训练或超参数调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CLIP模型的图像级预训练目标与密集预测所需的像素级视觉理解之间存在不对齐，现有方法继承了前几层的全局对齐偏差，导致分割性能不理想。

Method: 提出三种互补技术：语义空间重加权、选择性头增强和异常令牌替换，系统性地利用CLIP在层、头和令牌级别的视觉区分能力。

Result: 在8个常见语义分割基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LHT-CLIP在不同场景下均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LHT-CLIP有效恢复了视觉区分能力并提高了分割性能，突出了其在现实世界部署中的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

### [8] [DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907)
*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride是一个用于生成教学视频场景级字幕的管道，无需手动场景分割，通过自适应帧采样和多模态窗口技术来捕捉关键转换，产生连贯的指令性字幕。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教学视频中的场景级字幕需要理解视觉线索和时间结构，但现有字幕缺乏这种结构会导致不连贯和质量差，影响教育效果。

Method: 使用YouCookII数据集，通过自适应帧采样、多模态窗口技术、多模态思维链过程生成动作-对象对，并采用动态步长窗口选择算法来平衡时间上下文和冗余。

Result: 与VLLaMA3和GPT-4o等基线相比，在BLEU、METEOR等N-gram指标和BERTScore、CLIPScore等语义相似度指标上均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: DynaStride生成的字幕在时间连贯性和信息量方面表现更好，为改进AI驱动的教学内容生成提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

### [9] [TurboPortrait3D: Single-step diffusion-based fast portrait novel-view synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23929)
*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D是一种低延迟的人像新视角合成方法，通过结合图像到3D模型和扩散模型，在保持3D感知的同时显著提升渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人像图像到3D模型存在视觉伪影、细节缺失和身份保持不佳的问题，而图像扩散模型虽然质量高但缺乏3D一致性且计算成本高。

Method: 采用前馈图像到头像生成管道获取初始3D表示和噪声渲染，然后使用单步扩散模型进行多视角一致的精炼，结合合成多视图数据预训练和高质量真实图像微调。

Result: 在质量和数量上均优于当前最先进的人像新视角合成方法，同时保持时间效率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将图像扩散模型用于增强图像到头像方法，实现了高质量、3D一致且低延迟的人像新视角合成。

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

### [10] [PlanarGS: High-Fidelity Indoor 3D Gaussian Splatting Guided by Vision-Language Planar Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23930)
*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的室内场景重建框架，通过引入语言提示平面先验和几何监督，解决了在低纹理区域中3DGS的几何模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在室内场景中，3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)在大型低纹理区域存在几何模糊问题，无法恢复高保真3D表面。

Method: 设计了语言提示平面先验(LP3)流程，使用预训练视觉语言分割模型并通过跨视图融合和几何先验检查来优化区域建议。在3D高斯优化中增加了平面先验监督项和几何先验监督项。

Result: 在标准室内基准测试中，PlanarGS重建了准确详细的3D表面，大幅优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PlanarGS通过引入平面和几何先验，有效解决了3DGS在室内场景中的几何重建问题，实现了高质量的表面重建。

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

### [11] [Adaptive Training of INRs via Pruning and Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23943)
*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe是一种自适应隐式神经表示训练方案，通过神经元剪枝和输入频率密集化来优化网络架构，在保持重建质量的同时减小模型规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在选择输入频率和架构时存在挑战，通常需要启发式方法和繁重的超参数优化，且参数冗余问题未得到有效解决。

Method: 采用神经元剪枝机制避免冗余，通过目标权重衰减将信息转移到剩余神经元后进行结构化剪枝；通过输入频率密集化在信号欠拟合的频谱区域添加频率以扩展表示基础。

Result: 在图像和SDF上的实验表明，AIRe在减小模型规模的同时保持甚至提高了重建质量。

Conclusion: AIRe通过自适应训练方案实现了网络规模与重建质量之间的更好权衡，代码和预训练模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

### [12] [Neural USD: An object-centric framework for iterative editing and control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23956)
*Alejandro Escontrela,Shrinu Kushagra,Sjoerd van Steenkiste,Yulia Rubanova,Aleksander Holynski,Kelsey Allen,Kevin Murphy,Thomas Kipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Neural USD框架，通过分层结构化表示场景和对象，实现精确的逐对象编辑控制，解决了现有生成模型中编辑特定对象时导致全局变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控生成模型在精确迭代对象编辑方面存在挑战，改变条件信号往往导致场景的意外全局变化，需要解决这一限制。

Method: 借鉴计算机图形学中的USD标准，引入分层结构化场景表示，采用微调方法确保控制信号的解耦，支持对单个对象的外观、几何和姿态的独立控制。

Result: 评估了框架的多种设计考虑，展示了Neural USD如何支持迭代和增量式工作流程，实现了精确的对象级编辑。

Conclusion: Neural USD框架为生成模型提供了更精细的控制能力，支持结构化场景表示和对象级编辑，推动了可控生成建模的发展。

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

### [13] [SafeVision: Efficient Image Guardrail with Robust Policy Adherence and Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23960)
*Peiyang Xu,Minzhou Pan,Zhaorun Chen,Shuang Yang,Chaowei Xiao,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision是一种新型图像护栏系统，通过集成类人推理来增强适应性和透明度，无需重新训练即可动态适应不断变化的安全策略，在多个基准测试中表现优于GPT-4o且速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像护栏模型受限于预定义类别，缺乏语义推理能力，容易误分类内容，且难以适应新兴威胁，需要昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 采用有效的数据收集和生成框架、策略遵循训练流程、定制损失函数，以及多样化的问答生成和训练策略来增强学习效果。

Result: SafeVision在VisionHarm-T上比GPT-4o表现好8.6%，在VisionHarm-C上好15.5%，且速度快16倍以上。

Conclusion: SafeVision建立了一个全面、策略遵循且可解释的图像护栏系统，能够动态适应新兴威胁。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

Result: 在分布外评估中实现竞争性多标签分类，同时提高可解释性；在专家阅读研究中，完整推理轨迹增强了信心，支持错误审计，并减少了报告定稿时间。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持准确性的同时显著提高了模型的可解释性，为胸部放射学和其他医学成像任务中可信赖、可解释的AI发展提供了支持。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估多模态输入处理能力，缺乏真实的流式场景或仅支持短期任务，无法满足现实世界自我中心AI助手的需求。

Method: 构建包含工作学习、生活方式、社交活动和外出文化四个领域的同步多模态数据集，所有数据在统一时间轴上对齐，并通过人工精炼获得高质量视觉叙述和语音转录。

Result: 提出了两个关键指标——实时准确性和记忆持久时间，用于联合评估正确性、时间响应性和长期记忆保持能力。

Conclusion: TeleEgo为实用AI助手的发展提供了现实且全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed
tomography angiography (CTA) holds immense clinical potential, but its
development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We
launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing
a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation.
The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with
subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our
findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D
U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an
ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed
individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was
strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized
post-processing steps, and the characteristics of the training data. This
initiative not only establishes a new performance benchmark but also provides a

Conclusion: Mars-Bench旨在为火星科学的机器学习模型开发和比较建立标准化基础，促进火星特定基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

Conclusion: APT框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，提供了一种高效、可迁移的黑盒红队测试方法，能够有效评估文本到图像模型的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient

enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.

Motivation: 现有稀疏调优方法存在两阶段范式的问题：第一阶段基于梯度信息定位任务相关权重，忽略了微调过程中的参数调整；第二阶段仅更新定位的权重，导致高内存使用。

Method: 提出SNELLA单阶段方法：1) 通过两个低秩可学习矩阵合并的稀疏矩阵选择性更新权重矩阵；2) 引入非线性核函数扩展低秩分解，防止权重更新间的相互依赖；3) 自适应双层稀疏分配机制，基于重要性分数端到端地跨层和层内竞争权重。

Conclusion: SNELLA通过单阶段设计和自适应稀疏分配，有效解决了现有稀疏调优方法在性能和内存效率方面的限制，为参数高效微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

TL;DR: 提出COLA框架，通过最优传输理论解决CLIP模型在对抗攻击下的跨模态特征对齐问题，无需训练即可提升对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注对抗微调或提示优化，但忽视了CLIP编码特征中的文本和图像特征距离过远的问题，这种不对齐在对抗扰动下会被显著放大

Method: 1) 将对抗图像嵌入投影到类别文本特征张成的子空间；2) 将图像和文本建模为多个增强视图上的离散分布，通过最优传输细化对齐，子空间投影无缝集成到成本计算中

Result: 在14个零样本分类基准测试中表现优异，在ImageNet及其变体上对抗PGD攻击时平均提升6.7%，同时在干净样本上保持高准确率

Conclusion: COLA是一种无需训练、与现有微调模型兼容的框架，能有效解决对抗条件下的跨模态对齐问题，显著提升模型鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

TL;DR: 提出BOB方法，通过提取类无关属性并在微调T2I模型时显式条件化这些属性，然后在生成时边缘化它们，从而缓解过拟合问题，提高合成数据质量，在低样本细粒度分类任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用T2I模型生成合成训练数据用于分类存在挑战，微调T2I模型虽然能提高合成数据质量，但可能导致过拟合和多样性降低，特别是在细粒度分类任务中。

Method: BOB方法首先从少量真实样本中提取类无关属性（如场景背景和物体姿态），在微调T2I模型时显式条件化这些属性，然后在生成合成数据时边缘化这些属性。

Result: 在多个T2I模型、骨干网络和数据集上的实验表明，BOB在低样本细粒度分类中达到最先进性能，在Aircraft数据集上比DataDream提升7.4%，在24个实验设置中有18个优于先前方法。

Conclusion: BOB方法有效缓解了T2I模型微调时的过拟合问题，保持了生成先验，减少了估计误差，在低样本细粒度分类任务中显著提升了合成数据的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

TL;DR: OmniText是一个无需训练的通才方法，能够执行广泛的文本图像操作任务，包括文本移除、重缩放、重新定位以及具有各种样式的插入和编辑。它通过自注意力反转和交叉注意力重新分配来解决现有文本修复方法的局限性，并在多个任务和指标上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的文本修复方法存在三个关键限制：(i) 无法移除文本，(ii) 缺乏对渲染文本样式的控制，(iii) 倾向于生成重复字母。这些限制阻碍了它们在更广泛的文本图像操作任务中的应用。

Method: 研究了交叉注意力和自注意力机制的两个关键特性，以实现文本移除并提供对文本样式和内容的控制。使用自注意力反转来减轻模型对周围文本的关注，从而减少文本幻觉。重新分配交叉注意力，增加某些文本标记的概率以减少文本幻觉。对于可控修复，在潜在优化框架中引入了新的损失函数：交叉注意力内容损失以提高文本渲染准确性，自注意力样式损失以促进样式定制。

Result: OmniText是第一个能够执行多样化文本图像操作任务的通才方法。与其他文本修复方法相比，在多个任务和指标上实现了最先进的性能，并且与专业方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的OmniText框架通过利用注意力的特性，成功解决了现有文本修复方法的局限性，实现了多样化的文本图像操作任务，并在性能上达到了先进水平。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了统一异构知识蒸馏(UHKD)框架，通过在频域利用中间特征来解决异构架构间的语义差异问题，实现跨架构知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要针对同构模型，在异构场景下性能下降，特别是涉及中间特征时。架构多样性导致语义差异，阻碍了中间表示的有效利用。

Method: 使用傅里叶变换捕捉全局特征信息，缓解异构师生对之间的表示差异。包含特征转换模块(FTM)生成紧凑的频域表示，以及可学习的特征对齐模块(FAM)进行多级匹配对齐。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K数据集上，分别比最新方法提升了5.59%和0.83%的准确率。

Conclusion: UHKD是统一异构表示并有效利用视觉知识的有效方法，特别适用于异构架构间的知识蒸馏。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

Abstract: We present DogMo, a large-scale multi-view RGB-D video dataset capturing
diverse canine movements for the task of motion recovery from images. DogMo
comprises 1.2k motion sequences collected from 10 unique dogs, offering rich
variation in both motion and breed. It addresses key limitations of existing
dog motion datasets, including the lack of multi-view and real 3D data, as well
as limited scale and diversity. Leveraging DogMo, we establish four motion
recovery benchmark settings that support systematic evaluation across monocular
and multi-view, RGB and RGB-D inputs. To facilitate accurate motion recovery,
we further introduce a three-stage, instance-specific optimization pipeline
that fits the SMAL model to the motion sequences. Our method progressively
refines body shape and pose through coarse alignment, dense correspondence
supervision, and temporal regularization. Our dataset and method provide a
principled foundation for advancing research in dog motion recovery and open up
new directions at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and
animal behavior modeling.

*Jiajian Xie,Hubery Yin,Chen Li,Zhou Zhao,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC)框架，通过趋势一致性预测和模型特定误差容忍度搜索，解决扩散模型多步重用中的轨迹偏差问题，实现2.65倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但受限于昂贵的迭代采样。现有训练自由方法通过重用模型输出来加速，但忽略了去噪趋势且缺乏误差控制，导致轨迹偏差和结果不一致。

Method: ETC框架包含：(1) 一致性趋势预测器，利用扩散轨迹的平滑连续性，将历史去噪模式投影到稳定未来方向；(2) 模型特定误差容忍度搜索机制，通过识别从语义规划到质量精炼的过渡点来推导校正阈值。

Result: 实验显示ETC在FLUX基础上实现2.65倍加速，一致性退化可忽略（-0.074 SSIM分数）。

Conclusion: ETC框架通过趋势一致性预测和误差容忍度控制，有效解决了扩散模型加速中的轨迹偏差问题，实现了高效且稳定的加速效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架有效提升了文本到图像生成的布局忠实度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role
of high-quality video-text pairs in training models capable of producing
coherent and instruction-aligned videos. However, strategies for optimizing
video captions specifically for T2V training remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce VC4VG (Video Captioning for Video Generation), a
comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of T2V
models.We begin by analyzing caption content from a T2V perspective,
decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into
multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To
support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring
fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with
T2V-specific requirements.Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a
strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation
performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured
prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对SAM2的跨提示通用对抗攻击方法UAP-SAM2，通过双语义偏差框架解决SAM2在视频分割中的鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2作为SAM的继任者，在视频分割方面具有强大的泛化能力，但其对抗鲁棒性尚未被探索。现有针对SAM的攻击方法是否能直接迁移到SAM2尚不清楚。

Method: 提出UAP-SAM2方法，采用目标扫描策略将每帧分为k个区域并随机分配提示以减少提示依赖性，同时设计双语义偏差框架来扭曲当前帧语义并破坏连续帧间的语义一致性。

Result: 在六个数据集上的两个分割任务实验表明，UAP-SAM2显著优于现有最先进的攻击方法。

Conclusion: UAP-SAM2是首个针对SAM2的有效跨提示通用对抗攻击方法，成功解决了SAM2架构差异带来的挑战。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical
structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing
efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical
diagnostic scenarios. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MC-SJD训练无损并行解码框架，通过耦合方法解决标准SJD中token不稳定问题，显著加速自回归视觉生成，在图像和视频生成中分别实现4.2倍和13.3倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视觉生成模型推理速度慢，需要数千步生成单个样本，限制了实际应用。标准SJD虽然能加速，但token不稳定导致接受率降低。

Method: 基于耦合的信息论方法MC-SJD，最大化连续迭代中采样相同草稿token的概率，仅需单行代码修改现有算法，保持无损特性。

Result: 相比标准AR解码，图像生成加速约4.2倍，视频生成加速约13.3倍，且输出质量无退化。

Conclusion: MC-SJD通过简单修改有效解决了SJD的token不稳定问题，显著提升自回归视觉生成效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在推理时干预导致的分布偏移和属性纠缠问题，提升视觉质量和数据效用

Method: 使用条件扩散模型，包含身份掩码学习方案、身份解耦潜在重组器和身份引导潜在协调器，通过正交身份映射抑制身份泄露

Result: 在视觉质量、身份抑制和效用保持方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: ID²Face提供了一种有效的训练中心匿名化方法，实现了身份和非身份信息的明确解耦

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token修剪方法主要基于注意力分数选择最显著的token，导致所选token语义不完整。MLLMs处理大量视觉token会产生可观计算开销，其中许多token是冗余的。

Method: 提出SCOPE方法，定义token集合的覆盖度，计算未选token的覆盖度增益，将显著性分数整合到覆盖度增益中形成SCOPE分数，迭代选择最高SCOPE分数的token。

Conclusion: SCOPE方法通过联合考虑显著性和覆盖度，能够更好地保持语义完整性，同时有效减少计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The
dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Lipschitz正则化目标检测(LROD)框架，通过将图像恢复直接集成到检测器特征学习中，解决恢复网络与检测网络之间的功能不匹配问题，提高在恶劣条件下的检测稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在恶劣条件下（如雾霾和低光照），图像恢复通常作为预处理步骤来提升检测器性能。但恢复网络与检测网络之间的功能不匹配会引入不稳定性，这个问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 从Lipschitz连续性的角度分析恢复网络和检测网络在输入空间和参数空间的功能差异，提出LROD框架，将图像恢复直接集成到检测器特征学习中，在训练期间协调两个任务的Lipschitz连续性。

Result: 在雾霾和低光照基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LR-YOLO（Lipschitz正则化YOLO）持续提高了检测稳定性、优化平滑度和整体准确性。

Conclusion: LROD框架有效解决了恢复网络与检测网络之间的功能不匹配问题，通过协调Lipschitz连续性显著提升了在恶劣条件下的目标检测性能。

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

TL;DR: 提出了UtilGen框架，通过下游任务反馈自适应优化数据生成过程，生成任务特定的高效用训练数据，在8个基准数据集上平均准确率提升3.87%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强方法主要关注数据的内在属性（如保真度和多样性），而忽略了任务特定需求。不同任务和网络架构对训练数据的要求差异很大，需要数据生成器考虑下游任务需求。

Method: 引入权重分配网络评估每个合成样本的任务特定效用，采用双级优化策略：模型级优化定制生成模型以适应下游任务，实例级优化在每轮生成中调整生成策略（如提示嵌入和初始噪声）。

Result: 在8个不同复杂度和粒度的基准数据集上，UtilGen始终实现优越性能，平均准确率比之前SOTA提高3.87%。数据分析显示UtilGen产生更具影响力和任务相关的合成数据。

Conclusion: UtilGen验证了从视觉特征中心到任务效用中心的数据增强范式转变的有效性，能够生成更高质量的任务特定训练数据。

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

Motivation: 合成图像来源归因在数据稀缺条件下具有挑战性，需要少样本或零样本分类能力。现有方法在样本有限时性能受限。

Method: 训练免费的单样本归因方法：1）生成图像描述提示词；2）用所有候选源模型重合成图像；3）在特征空间中选择最接近原始图像的重合成结果进行归因。

Result: 提出的重合成方法在只有少量训练样本时优于现有最先进的少样本方法和其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺条件下表现出色，同时新构建的数据集为开发和评估少样本和零样本方法提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLMs在细粒度视觉感知方面的瓶颈，现有方法要么损害通用能力，要么偏重文本推理而忽视视觉感知。

Method: 设计两阶段任务，将视觉感知学习构建为从粗到细的渐进过程，结合图像级和实例级重建，采用两阶段强化学习策略形成闭环训练范式。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL模型上应用ViPER得到Qwen-Viper系列，在7个综合基准上平均提升1.7%，细粒度感知任务上提升达6.0%。

Conclusion: ViPER不仅实现了感知能力的自我提升，还证明了生成与理解之间的互惠关系，为开发更自主、更强大的VLMs提供了突破。

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Motivation: 遥感应用中深度学习性能受限于标注数据稀缺和跨域标注成本高，现有视觉语言模型如CLIP直接应用于遥感领域存在显著域差距和任务特定语义适应需求。

Method: 评估了四种代表性提示学习方法：上下文优化、条件上下文优化、多模态提示学习、带自调节约束的提示学习，并与零样本CLIP和线性探针基准进行比较。

Conclusion: 提示学习是连接卫星和航空影像域差距的可扩展高效解决方案，为未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance
across various tasks. However, the learning effects are still limited by the
strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher

switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image
segmentation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: W2-Net通过双查询机制（what-to-count和where-to-see查询）解决指称表达计数问题，显式解耦对象定位和属性特征提取，结合子类可分离匹配策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指称表达计数方法存在根本性挑战：标注点通常位于类别代表性位置（如头部），迫使模型关注类别级特征而忽略其他视觉区域（如腿部对于"行走"属性）的属性信息。

Method: 提出W2-Net框架，包含：1）双查询机制：what-to-count查询定位对象，where-to-see查询从属性特定视觉区域提取特征；2）子类可分离匹配（SSM）：在标签分配中引入排斥力增强子类间可分离性。

Result: 在REC-8K数据集上显著优于现有最优方法：计数误差降低22.5%（验证集）和18.0%（测试集），定位F1分数分别提升7%和8%。

Conclusion: W2-Net通过显式解耦对象定位和属性特征提取，有效解决了指称表达计数中的关键挑战，在计数精度和定位性能上均取得显著提升。

Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to
the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual
expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A
fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are
typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing
models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information
from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we
propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into
"what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically,
alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we
introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to
seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling
precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable
Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force
to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing
counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving
localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.

TL;DR: StrokeSeg是一个轻量级模块化框架，可将研究级脑卒中病灶分割模型转化为可部署的临床应用工具，通过解耦预处理、推理和后处理，使用ONNX Runtime和Float16量化，模型大小减少约50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习框架（如nnU-Net）在脑卒中病灶分割方面表现优异，但由于依赖复杂和单体设计，难以在临床环境中部署。

Method: 采用模块化设计：预处理使用Anima工具箱生成BIDS兼容输出，推理使用ONNX Runtime和Float16量化，提供图形界面和命令行界面，支持Python脚本和独立Windows可执行文件。

Result: 在300名亚急性和慢性脑卒中患者的测试集上，分割性能与原始PyTorch管道相当（Dice差异<10^-3）。

Conclusion: 高性能研究管道可以转化为便携、临床可用的工具，实现研究到临床的无缝转化。

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种亮度感知多尺度网络(MLSN)，用于在复杂光照环境下融合偏振图像，解决了偏振图像固有的对比度差异问题，并在多个数据集上取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏振图像融合结合S0和DOLP图像可以揭示表面粗糙度和材料特性，在伪装识别、组织病理分析和表面缺陷检测等领域有重要应用。但不同偏振图像在复杂光照环境下存在固有对比度差异，需要有效整合互补信息。

Method: 提出MLSN网络：编码器阶段通过亮度分支生成多尺度空间权重矩阵，动态加权注入亮度信息；瓶颈层设计全局-局部特征融合机制，通过窗口自注意力计算平衡全局上下文和局部细节；解码器阶段提出亮度增强模块，建立亮度分布与纹理特征的映射关系，实现融合结果的非线性亮度校正。

Result: 在MSP、PIF和GAND数据集上的实验表明，MLSN在主观和客观评估中均优于现有方法，MS-SSIM和SD指标分别比其他方法平均值高出8.57%、60.64%、10.26%、63.53%、22.21%和54.31%。

Conclusion: MLSN网络有效解决了复杂光照环境下偏振图像融合的对比度差异问题，提出的MSP数据集填补了偏振图像融合领域高质量数据集的空白，为相关应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,

Motivation: 医学图像通常伴随包含专家标注的放射学报告，但依赖这些报告需要放射科医生的手动工作。研究旨在确定何时以及如何利用放射学报告来改进仅基于图像的分类。

Method: 系统研究放射学报告在预训练和微调阶段的使用，涵盖诊断和预后任务，并在不同训练集规模下进行评估。

Result: 发现：(1) 当标签在文本中明确表示时，预训练阶段利用报告有益；但对弱关联任务，显式图像-文本对齐可能有害；(2) 微调阶段使用报告能带来显著改进，在某些情况下比预训练方法影响更大。

Conclusion: 研究为如何利用特权文本数据训练医学图像分类器提供了可操作的见解，同时指出了当前研究中的空白。

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

Motivation: 脑卒中后MRI显示的继发性结构变化（如萎缩和脑室扩大）是恢复和预后的影像生物标志物，但现有监督分割方法难以有效捕捉这些异常

Method: 使用REFLECT流式生成模型进行无监督异常检测，在ATLAS数据集上使用双专家中心切片标注，通过自由响应ROC分析评估异常图性能，比较在卒中患者无病灶切片和健康对照数据上训练的模型

Result: 在ATLAS测试对象上，使用健康对照数据（IXI）训练的模型在病灶分割（Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27）和非病灶异常敏感性（FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43）方面表现更好

Conclusion: 在完全健康的解剖结构上训练可以更好地建模正常变异，从而更广泛可靠地检测结构异常

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference
implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including
GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation.
Experimental results have shown that GenTrack provides superior performance on

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.

*Ali Ahmad Faour,Nabil Amacha,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于卫星图像和机器学习的无传感器方法，用于实时监测黎巴嫩Qaraaoun水库的蓄水量，无需地面测量设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Qaraaoun水库因传感器频繁故障和维护能力有限而难以可靠监测储水量的问题。

Method: 结合开源卫星影像（Sentinel-2和Landsat）、新型水体分割指数和基于支持向量回归的机器学习模型，仅通过卫星提取的水面面积估算水库容积。

Result: 水体分割准确率超过95%，优化后的SVR模型误差低于水库总容量的1.5%，决定系数超过0.98。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性和成本效益，为水库储量的连续、独立于传感器的监测提供了实用解决方案，可推广到其他水体。

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the
resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate
change and environmental patterns.

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门用于评估语义分割中可解释AI的全面系统框架，考虑了空间和上下文任务复杂性，使用像素级评估策略和精心设计的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在安全关键领域的应用增加，确保模型透明度和信任至关重要。虽然分类任务的可解释AI评估已有进展，但语义分割的评估策略相对不足。

Method: 开发了专门针对语义分割的评估框架，采用像素级评估策略和精心设计的指标，使用基于类激活映射的可解释AI方案进行模拟验证。

Result: 模拟结果表明所提方法具有高效性、鲁棒性和可靠性，能够提供细粒度的可解释性洞察。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推进透明、可信和可问责的语义分割模型发展。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

*Zhineng Zhao,Zhihai He,Zikun Zhou,Siwei Ma,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DCIC-sgp框架，通过自生成先验实现深度条件化图像压缩，有效解耦全局结构和局部纹理，显著减少低码率下的几何变形伪影


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学习型图像压缩方法难以建模自然图像中复杂的相关性结构，特别是全局不变结构与局部瞬态纹理的纠缠，导致低码率下出现严重几何变形

Method: 基于功能分解的框架，首先编码自生成先验来捕捉图像结构主干，然后深度调节整个压缩流水线，特别是分析变换，使其专注于残差的高熵细节

Result: 视觉分析显示大幅减轻了传统编解码器在低码率下的几何变形伪影；在Kodak、CLIC和Tecnick数据集上相比VVC测试模型VTM-12.1分别实现了14.4%、15.7%和15.1%的BD-rate降低

Conclusion: 通过深度条件化和层次化依赖驱动的方法实现了信息流的有效解耦，在保持高率失真性能的同时显著改善了压缩质量

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视频扩散模型(VDMs)在视觉任务中比语言模型表现更好，具有更强的数据效率和组合理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言领域表现出色，但在视觉领域仍面临组合理解、样本效率和通用问题解决能力的挑战，需要探索更好的视觉基础模型

Method: 使用预训练的视频扩散模型(VDMs)和语言模型(LLMs)，配备轻量级适配器，在自然模态任务中进行对比评估

Result: 在ARC-AGI、ConceptARC、视觉游戏、路径规划和元胞自动机等基准测试中，VDMs比语言模型具有更高的数据效率

Conclusion: 视频预训练提供了支持视觉基础模型发展的归纳偏置，是推进视觉AI的有前景方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kineo是一个无需标定的多视角运动捕捉系统，使用未同步、未标定的消费级RGB相机，通过2D关键点同时进行相机标定和3D重建，在精度和效率上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无标定运动捕捉方法存在计算成本高、重建精度低的问题，限制了非专业人士和在野外环境中的使用。

Method: 利用现成的2D关键点检测器，通过置信度驱动的时空关键点采样策略和图优化方法，同时进行相机标定（包括畸变系数）和3D关键点重建。

Result: 在EgoHumans和Human3.6M数据集上，相比现有方法，相机平移误差减少83-85%，相机角度误差减少86-92%，世界关节平均误差减少83-91%。

Conclusion: Kineo提供了一个高效、准确的无标定运动捕捉解决方案，显著提升了实用性和可访问性。

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

*Kyungmin Lee,Sihyun Yu,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Decoupled MeanFlow方法，将流模型转换为流映射模型，无需架构修改，实现1-4步高质量生成，在ImageNet上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去噪生成模型需要大量去噪步骤，流映射能减少离散化误差并加速采样，但传统训练方法需要架构修改，限制了与预训练流模型的兼容性。

Method: 通过条件化扩散变换器的最终块到后续时间步，将预训练流模型直接重新用作流映射，结合增强训练技术。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512上，1步FID分别达到2.16和2.12，4步FID分别达到1.51和1.68，比流模型快100倍以上。

Conclusion: 训练流模型后转换比从头训练流映射更高效有效，实现了高质量快速生成。

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

TL;DR: Latent Sketchpad是一个为多模态大语言模型添加内部视觉草稿纸的框架，通过视觉潜在表示支持生成式视觉思维，提升复杂场景中的视觉规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉理解方面表现出色，但在需要视觉规划和想象的复杂场景中表现不佳。受人类使用草图进行视觉思维的启发，希望为模型提供类似的视觉思考能力。

Method: 在现有MLLMs基础上集成视觉生成到自回归推理过程中，包含两个组件：上下文感知视觉头自回归生成视觉表示，预训练草图解码器将这些表示渲染为可解释图像。

Result: 在MazePlanning数据集上的实验表明，Latent Sketchpad在保持推理能力的同时，实现了与骨干模型相当甚至更优的推理性能，并能泛化到不同的前沿MLLMs。

Conclusion: 通过将模型的文本推理扩展到视觉思维，该框架为人机交互和更广泛的应用开辟了新机会。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSWorld-MCP是首个全面公平的基准测试，用于评估计算机使用代理在真实环境中的工具调用、GUI操作和决策能力，填补了过去评估主要关注GUI交互而忽略工具调用能力的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态代理在决策和推理能力上的进步，它们在计算机应用场景中展现出强大潜力。过去的评估主要关注GUI交互技能，而工具调用能力（如通过模型上下文协议MCP实现）被严重忽视，导致对集成工具调用的代理与仅评估GUI交互的代理进行比较存在不公平性。

Method: 设计了一个新颖的自动代码生成流水线来创建工具，并结合从现有工具中精心挑选的工具。通过严格的手动验证产生了158个高质量工具（覆盖7个常见应用），每个工具都验证了功能正确性、实际适用性和多功能性。

Result: 在OSWorld-MCP上对最先进的多模态代理进行广泛评估显示，MCP工具普遍提高了任务成功率（例如OpenAI o3在15步时从8.3%提升到20.4%，Claude 4 Sonnet在50步时从40.1%提升到43.3%）。然而，即使是最强的模型工具调用率也相对较低，仅为36.3%。

Conclusion: 通过明确测量MCP工具使用技能，OSWorld-MCP加深了对多模态代理的理解，并为评估在复杂、工具辅助环境中的性能设定了新标准。

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%
to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of
assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for
improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring
MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents
and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted
environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的散射伪影校正方法，利用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并嵌入KAN网络中，结合物理先验知识有效校正CBCT中的散射伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT在数据采集过程中容易受到散射影响，导致CT值偏差和组织对比度降低，从而降低诊断准确性。需要一种有效的散射伪影校正方法。

Method: 利用散射概率密度分布在投影域具有旋转对称性的物理先验，使用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并将其嵌入KAN网络层中，利用KAN的高效非线性映射能力学习高维散射特征。

Result: 通过合成和真实扫描实验验证，该方法能有效校正重建图像中的散射伪影，在定量指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合散射光子分布的物理特性和KAN的复杂函数映射能力，提出的模型能够更准确地表示散射，有效提升CBCT图像质量。

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

Motivation: 生成式AI的快速发展使得伪造人脸图像越来越逼真，这对AI安全、数字媒体完整性和公众信任构成严重威胁，迫切需要鲁棒且可泛化的人脸伪造检测方法。

Method: 采用双分支CNN架构：RGB分支捕获语义信息，频率分支关注高频伪影；引入通道注意力模块自适应融合异构特征；设计统一损失函数FSC Loss结合焦点损失、监督对比损失和频率中心边界损失。

Result: 在DiFF基准测试中，模型在所有类别（文本到图像、图像到图像、人脸交换、人脸编辑）都表现出色，超越了人类平均准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在检测各种人脸伪造技术方面具有有效性，为保护AI生态系统免受视觉伪造攻击做出了潜在贡献。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but
difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to
average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve
decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain
diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present
PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual
search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during
cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse
interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision
data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data
collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an
application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909
fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In
addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both

Result: 在现有图像编辑框架上的大量实验表明，GRAG只需四行代码即可集成，能持续提升编辑质量。相比常用的Classifier-Free Guidance，GRAG实现了更平滑和精确的编辑程度控制。

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/little-misfit/GRAG-Image-Editing.

*Mia Kan,Yilin Liu,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAGE方法，通过结构引导和生成合成实现零样本视频过渡，在多样片段间产生平滑、语义一致的过渡效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频过渡方法在处理大时间间隔或显著语义差异的片段时，难以保持视觉连贯性和内容感知能力

Method: 结合艺术工作流程，使用线图和运动流提供结构引导，与生成合成相结合，无需微调即可实现零样本视频过渡

Result: 在定量指标和用户研究中，SAGE优于传统方法和生成基线，能够处理多样片段间的过渡

Conclusion: SAGE通过结构感知的生成方法，有效解决了视频过渡中的语义一致性和视觉连贯性问题

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

TL;DR: MIC-BEV是一个基于Transformer的鸟瞰图感知框架，用于基础设施多摄像头3D目标检测，支持可变数量摄像头和异构参数，在传感器退化条件下保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于摄像头的检测模型在基础设施感知场景中表现不佳，面临多视角设置、不同摄像头配置、视觉输入退化以及各种道路布局等挑战。

Method: 提出图增强融合模块，利用摄像头与BEV单元之间的几何关系和潜在视觉线索，将多视角图像特征集成到BEV空间中。

Result: 在M2I合成数据集和真实世界RoScenes数据集上的实验表明，MIC-BEV在3D目标检测中达到最先进性能，在极端天气和传感器退化条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MIC-BEV展示了在现实世界部署的潜力，为智能交通系统提供可靠的基础设施感知解决方案。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现预训练的视觉变换器(ViTs)中自然涌现出物体绑定能力，能够识别哪些图像块属于同一物体，这种能力在自监督模型中表现更强，并主动指导注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉变换器是否自然具备物体绑定能力，即识别哪些图像块属于同一物体的能力，这被认为是人类认知的核心功能。

Method: 使用相似性探针从ViT各层的图像块嵌入中解码"IsSameObject"属性，比较不同预训练目标(DINO、MAE、CLIP、ImageNet监督)的模型表现。

Result: 自监督ViTs能够以超过90%的准确率解码物体绑定信息，而ImageNet监督模型表现明显较弱；IsSameObject编码在物体特征之上的低维子空间中，并主动指导注意力。

Conclusion: ViTs确实具备自然涌现的物体绑定能力，这种能力不是架构的副产品，而是通过特定预训练目标获得的，挑战了ViTs缺乏物体绑定的观点。

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMoE是一个针对扩散变换器（DiTs）的混合专家框架，通过两步路由器和显式路由指导来解决视觉MoE中的专家专业化问题，在ImageNet基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE方法在语言模型中表现良好，但在视觉扩散模型中效果有限，主要原因是语言token语义密集且变化显著，而视觉token存在空间冗余和功能异质性，阻碍了专家的专业化。

Method: 提出ProMoE框架，包含两步路由器：条件路由根据功能角色将图像token划分为条件集和无条件集；原型路由通过可学习原型基于语义内容细化条件token的分配。还提出了路由对比损失来增强原型路由过程。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，ProMoE在Rectified Flow和DDPM训练目标下均超越了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ProMoE通过显式路由指导和两步路由机制成功解决了视觉MoE中的专家专业化问题，证明了语义指导对视觉MoE的重要性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: URSA是一个离散视频生成框架，通过线性化度量路径和分辨率相关时间步移机制，实现了高效的高分辨率图像合成和长视频生成，性能媲美连续扩散方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续空间视频生成发展迅速，而离散方法由于误差累积和长上下文不一致性问题而落后，需要重新审视离散生成建模。

Method: 将视频生成任务制定为离散时空标记的迭代全局优化，集成线性化度量路径和分辨率相关时间步移机制，并引入异步时间微调策略统一多种任务。

Result: 在具有挑战性的视频和图像生成基准测试中，URSA始终优于现有离散方法，并达到与最先进连续扩散方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: URSA是一个简单而强大的框架，弥合了离散方法与连续方法在可扩展视频生成方面的差距，实现了高效的高分辨率图像合成和长视频生成。

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Generative View Stitching (GVS)方法，通过并行采样整个序列来解决自回归视频扩散模型在相机引导生成中的碰撞问题，实现稳定、无碰撞且帧间一致的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型虽然能进行长序列稳定生成，但无法利用未来信息来指导当前生成，在预定义相机轨迹的场景中容易导致与生成场景的碰撞，进而导致生成崩溃。

Method: GVS采样算法将机器人规划中的扩散缝合技术扩展到视频生成，兼容任何使用Diffusion Forcing训练的现成视频模型，并引入Omni Guidance技术通过同时条件化过去和未来信息来增强时间一致性。

Result: GVS实现了稳定、无碰撞、帧间一致且能闭合循环的相机引导视频生成，适用于各种预定义相机路径，包括奥斯卡·路透斯瓦德的不可能阶梯。

Conclusion: GVS方法有效解决了自回归视频扩散模型在相机引导生成中的局限性，实现了高质量、一致性的视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best
viewed as videos at https://andrewsonga.github.io/gvs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出BERT-ViT-EF模型和其扩展DTCN，通过早期融合策略和对比学习提升多模态情感分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析通过联合分析文本和图像数据，能比单模态方法提供更丰富准确的情感理解。

Method: BERT-ViT-EF结合BERT和ViT编码器进行早期融合；DTCN在BERT后添加Transformer层细化文本上下文，并使用对比学习对齐文本和图像表示。

Result: 在TumEmo数据集上达到78.4%准确率和78.3% F1分数，在MVSA-Single上达到76.6%准确率和75.9% F1分数。

Conclusion: 早期融合和更深层次的上下文建模在基于Transformer的多模态情感分析中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

*Alexandre Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析MACE力场的计算瓶颈，评估低精度执行策略，使用cuEquivariance后端和混合精度推理，在保持物理精度的同时显著提升了计算性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习力场虽然能提供精确的分子动力学模拟，但计算成本高昂。目前缺乏关于SO(3)等变模型如MACE是否可以通过降低精度算术和GPU优化内核来降低成本而不损害物理保真度的系统证据。

Method: 对MACE进行端到端和逐块性能分析，比较e3nn和NVIDIA cuEquivariance后端，评估FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16精度设置（使用FP32累加）在推理、短NVT和长NPT水模拟以及玩具训练运行中的表现。

Result: cuEquivariance将推理延迟降低约3倍。在FP32模型中将线性层转换为BF16/FP16可获得约4倍的额外加速，而NVT/NPT MD中的能量和热力学观测值保持在运行间变异性范围内。训练中的半精度权重会降低力RMSE。

Conclusion: 融合等变内核和混合精度推理可以显著加速最先进的力场，对下游MD影响可忽略。实用策略是默认使用cuEquivariance和FP32，为线性层启用BF16/FP16（保持FP32累加）以获得最大吞吐量，而训练保持在FP32。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

Motivation: 对抗性攻击对医疗AI系统构成严重风险，可能导致危险误诊和治疗延误，特别是在服务不足人群中威胁患者安全。

Method: 通过威胁建模、实验基准测试和模型评估，在皮肤科数据集上进行实证实验，测试对抗性攻击的影响和防御方法的有效性。

Result: 对抗性攻击显著降低分类准确性，防御方法如对抗训练和蒸馏能降低攻击成功率，但需要在清洁数据上的模型性能与防御效果之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 需要整合技术、伦理和政策方法，构建更具韧性和公平性的医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种浅层森林方法DiNo和RanBu，通过将少量深度受限的树转换为高效的距离加权预测器，显著降低了随机森林的推理延迟和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机森林集成在表格预测任务中表现优异，但依赖数百棵深树导致高推理延迟和内存需求，限制了在延迟敏感或资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: DiNo通过观测对的最远共同祖先测量同源距离，RanBu对Breiman的经典邻近度度量应用核平滑。两种方法都在森林训练后完全操作，无需额外生长树，仅需轻量级矩阵向量操作调整单带宽参数h。

Result: 在3个合成基准和25个公共数据集上，RanBu匹配或超过了全深度随机森林的准确性（特别是在高噪声设置中），同时将训练加推理时间减少高达95%。DiNo在低噪声机制中以适度的计算成本实现了最佳偏差-方差权衡。两种方法可直接扩展到分位数回归，在保持准确性的同时获得显著速度提升。

Conclusion: DiNo和RanBu是高效的浅层森林方法，能够在保持或提升准确性的同时大幅降低计算成本，特别适用于延迟敏感和资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在利用医学知识提高预测准确性时，忽视了通过预测过程扩展医学知识的机会。社交媒体用户生成内容为心理健康监测提供了实时数据源。

Method: 开发闭环LLM-知识图谱框架，包含知识感知的抑郁症检测阶段（LLM联合执行抑郁症检测和实体提取）和知识精炼扩展阶段（在专家监督下将新实体、关系和类型整合到知识图谱中）。

Result: 该框架在大规模用户生成内容上提高了预测准确性，并通过专家评估确认发现了与现有文献互补的临床有意义症状、共病和社会触发因素。

Conclusion: 概念化和操作化了预测-学习和学习-预测作为相互促进的过程，展示了计算模型和领域知识的共同进化，为其他动态风险监测环境提供了自适应、数据驱动的知识系统基础。

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

TL;DR: TracePile是一个包含260万个样本的大规模语料库，将代码执行转化为显式的链式执行推理步骤，通过三种训练设置显著提升大语言模型在数学、代码、逻辑和算法等领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接使用原始代码训练大语言模型存在不足，因为代码中的推理过程往往是隐式的，并且与语法或实现噪声纠缠在一起。

Method: 开发TracePile语料库，将代码执行转化为显式的链式执行推理步骤，包含变量追踪问题和代码重写，采用继续预训练、指令调优和两阶段微调三种训练设置。

Result: 在四个基础模型和20个基准测试上均表现出持续改进，特别是LLaMA3.1-8B在九个数学数据集上平均提升7.1%，在LiveCodeBench、CRUX和MMLU上也有明显提升。

Conclusion: TracePile通过将隐式代码推理转化为显式链式执行，有效提升了大语言模型的推理能力，证明了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO)框架，通过最大似然估计将偏好优化与（排序）选择建模相结合，支持多选和排名反馈，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐主要依赖成对偏好优化，但忽略了从更丰富的人类反馈形式（如多选比较和排名）中学习的机会。

Method: 提出了RCPO统一框架，支持基于效用和基于排名的选择模型，包含多种现有成对方法，并为更丰富的反馈格式提供原则性训练目标。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-it模型上的实证研究表明，RCPO在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard基准测试中始终优于竞争基线。

Conclusion: RCPO展示了直接利用排序偏好数据结合适当选择模型可以实现更有效的对齐，为将（排序）选择建模融入LLM训练提供了通用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

TL;DR: LLMCOMP是一种利用解码器专用大语言模型进行科学数据压缩的新范式，通过将3D场量化为离散标记、Z-order曲线排列和覆盖引导采样，训练自回归变换器建模标记转换，在严格误差界限下实现比现有方法高30%的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率科学模拟和观测系统产生海量时空数据集，需要高效、有误差界限的压缩方法。同时，解码器专用大语言模型在建模复杂序列数据方面表现出色。

Method: 将3D场量化为离散标记，通过Z-order曲线排列保持局部性，应用覆盖引导采样提高训练效率，训练带有时空嵌入的自回归变换器建模标记转换，压缩时进行top-k预测并存储排名索引和回退校正以确保严格误差界限。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了LLMs作为高保真科学数据通用压缩器的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Noise Combination Sampling的新方法，通过在噪声子空间中合成最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，从而在扩散模型的生成过程中自然嵌入条件信息，无需依赖逐步超参数调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型在零样本逆问题求解中表现出色，但存在一个固有困境：过度整合观察信息会破坏生成过程，而整合不足则无法强调逆问题的约束条件。

Method: Noise Combination Sampling方法在噪声子空间中合成最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，替代标准去噪扩散概率模型过程中的噪声项，使条件信息自然嵌入生成过程。

Result: 该方法可应用于广泛的逆问题求解器，包括图像压缩，特别是在生成步骤数T较小时，以可忽略的计算开销实现卓越性能，显著提高鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: Noise Combination Sampling方法有效解决了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的整合困境，提供了一种无需超参数调整的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

Motivation: 为了解决集合包含问题的应用需求，需要设计能够保持集合包含关系的集合到向量函数，即S⊆T当且仅当F(S)≤F(T)。

Method: 提出了单调分离(MAS)集合函数的概念，在无限基础集情况下开发了弱MAS模型，并证明了其Holder连续性。

Result: 建立了MAS函数向量维度的上下界，证明了无限基础集下MAS函数不存在但弱MAS模型可行，实验显示该模型在集合包含任务中优于标准集合模型。

Conclusion: MAS函数可用于构建通用单调模型，弱MAS模型在保持集合包含关系方面具有优势，为集合包含问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字个人助理需要高质量标注数据，但用户标注常存在错误和噪声。先前SKEL研究缺乏最终用户的确认验证，本研究旨在在真实条件下评估SKEL性能。

Method: 让大学学生在个人设备上使用iLog移动应用进行四周实验，用户可以基于当前视角和需求精炼输入标签。

Result: 研究发现在用户努力和数据质量之间找到适当平衡具有挑战性，但SKEL显示出减少标注工作量和提高收集数据质量的潜在优势。

Conclusion: SKEL在真实用户环境中具有实用价值，但需要仔细权衡用户参与度与数据质量之间的关系。

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

Conclusion: SAL-T为高能物理等资源受限环境提供了一种高效的变换器替代方案，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LRQK是一种两阶段框架，通过低秩分解查询和键矩阵来减少KV缓存的内存占用，同时保持注意力输出的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着输入文本长度增加，LLMs中的KV缓存导致GPU内存成本过高，限制了资源受限设备上的长上下文推理。现有方法如KV量化和剪枝会损失数值精度或保留次优的键值对。

Method: 两阶段框架：在预填充阶段将全精度查询和键矩阵分解为紧凑的秩-r因子；在解码阶段使用低维投影计算代理注意力分数，采用混合GPU-CPU缓存和命中-未命中机制，仅传输缺失的全精度KV对。

Result: 在RULER和LongBench基准测试中，LRQK在长上下文设置中匹配或超越了领先的稀疏注意力方法，同时显著节省内存且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: LRQK通过低秩分解和混合缓存机制，有效解决了长上下文推理中的内存瓶颈问题，在保持精度的同时大幅减少内存使用。

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

Method: 提出CLP框架，包含：1）可微凹门算法，通过基于梯度的优化自动识别最佳连续层段进行剪枝；2）截止端点调优策略，仅微调剪枝段相邻层来有效恢复模型性能。

Result: 在多个模型架构（LLaMA2、LLaMA3、Qwen）和规模（7B到70B参数）上的实验表明，CLP显著优于现有基线。在20%剪枝率下，LLaMA3-70B平均性能保持95.34%，比基线高4.29%-30.52%。

Conclusion: CLP能有效压缩大语言模型，且可与量化无缝结合进一步压缩模型，仅带来轻微性能损失。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

*Saklain Niam,Tashfiqur Rahman,Md. Amjad Patwary,Mukarram Hossain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究开发了首个机器学习框架来预测冷等离子体处理对种子发芽的提升效果，使用Extra Trees模型在五种作物上取得了最佳预测性能（R²=0.919），并揭示了等离子体处理的激素效应规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷等离子体是一种环保的种子发芽促进方法，但由于复杂的种子-等离子体-环境相互作用，其效果难以预测，需要开发可靠的预测模型。

Method: 采用机器学习方法（包括GB、XGB、ET及其混合模型），基于介电阻挡放电等离子体处理参数（电压、时间、功率等）来预测大豆、大麦、向日葵、萝卜和番茄的发芽提升效果。

Result: Extra Trees模型表现最佳（R²=0.919），特征筛选后提升至0.925。发现激素效应：7-15kV、200-500s处理效果最佳，超过20kV或长时间处理反而降低发芽率。不同物种和品种的预测精度存在差异。

Conclusion: 该机器学习框架成功预测了冷等离子体处理的种子发芽提升效果，并集成到MLflow中，为精准农业中的种子处理优化提供了决策支持工具。

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

TL;DR: ELBO-KTO是一种结合ELBO替代扩散对数似然与无配对偏好目标(KTO)的方法，用于对齐扩散语言模型的人类偏好，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(dLLMs)作为自回归生成器的替代方案，但对其人类偏好对齐具有挑战性，因为序列对数似然难以计算且配对偏好数据收集成本高。

Method: 引入ELBO-KTO方法，结合ELBO替代扩散对数似然与基于前景理论的无配对偏好目标(KTO)，分析ELBO替代带来的偏差和方差，并采用方差减少技术稳定训练梯度。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct上，ELBO-KTO在kto-mix-14k和UltraFeedback-Binary上分别获得65.9%和62.3%的调整胜率。在GSM8K、MMLU等下游任务中，表现与基础模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: 这确立了无配对偏好优化作为扩散LLMs中配对对齐的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习模型在处理高维复杂数据集时存在困难，需要量子计算等先进技术来提高分类效率，特别是在图像分类任务中。

Method: 使用ResNet-50从马铃薯病害RGB图像中提取深度特征，通过主成分分析(PCA)进行降维，然后使用QSVM模型应用ZZ、Z和Pauli-X等量子特征映射将经典数据转换为量子态。

Result: 基于Z特征映射的QSVM模型准确率达到99.23%，超越了传统的支持向量机(SVM)和随机森林(RF)模型。

Conclusion: 这项研究突出了将量子计算集成到图像分类中的优势，并通过混合量子-经典建模提供了潜在的病害检测解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Conclusion: 量子神经网络在医学图像分析中具有潜力，特别是在标记数据有限的情况下，为将量子计算整合到深度学习驱动的医疗诊断系统中奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

Motivation: 准确绘制农业景观上空的柱平均CO2浓度对于指导排放减排策略至关重要，特别是在家禽养殖密集区域。

Method: 融合小波时频表示与transformer注意力机制，结合气象、植被指数、地形和土地覆盖数据，构建ST-ViWT框架。

Result: 在2024年OCO-2数据上达到R2=0.984，RMSE=0.468 ppm；92.3%的填补预测在±1 ppm内；TCCON验证显示偏差=-0.14 ppm，r=0.928；家禽设施密度与XCO2呈中等正相关(r=0.43)。

Conclusion: 该方法支持卫星约束与国家清单和精准畜牧业平台的整合，实现可扩展、透明、空间明确的碳核算、热点优先排序和政策相关的减排评估。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

Result: 在多种数据集、编码方案和模态上的实验表明，TEMPEST在保持与最先进方法竞争性精度的同时，显著减少了语义分类所需的标记数量，降低了计算复杂度和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了直接从压缩表示学习语义的有效性，在保持准确性的同时实现了内存和计算效率的提升。

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and
transmission, yet their potential for representation learning remains largely
underexplored. We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed
rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of
compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

TL;DR: OAT是一个基于基础模型的拓扑优化框架，能够直接预测任意长宽比、分辨率、体积分数、载荷和边界条件下的最小柔度布局，相比现有方法将平均柔度降低达90%，并在单GPU上实现亚秒级推理。


<details>

Motivation: 现有深度学习拓扑优化方法局限于固定方形网格、少量手工编码的边界条件和后处理优化，无法实现通用部署。需要开发能够处理任意边界条件和几何参数的通用框架。

Method: OAT结合了分辨率无关和形状无关的自编码器、隐式神经场解码器，以及基于OpenTO数据集（220万个优化结构，覆盖200万种边界条件配置）训练的潜在扩散模型。

Result: 在四个公共基准和两个未见测试上，OAT将平均柔度降低达90%，在64×64到256×256分辨率及高达10:1的长宽比下，单GPU推理时间小于1秒。

Conclusion: OAT为物理感知拓扑优化提供了一个通用、快速且分辨率无关的框架，并为逆向设计的生成建模研究提供了大规模数据集。

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for
physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur
further research in generative modeling for inverse design. Code & data can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一模型难以捕捉交通流数据中复杂的非线性多尺度时间模式，需要开发更有效的混合预测方法。

Method: 使用STL将时间序列分解为趋势、季节性和残差三个分量，然后分别用LSTM建模长期趋势、ARIMA捕捉季节性周期、XGBoost预测非线性残差波动，最后通过乘法集成获得最终预测。

Result: 在纽约市交叉口998条交通流记录上的实验表明，该混合模型在MAE、RMSE和R平方指标上显著优于单独的LSTM、ARIMA和XGBoost模型。

Conclusion: 分解策略有效分离了时间特征，使每个模型能够专门化处理特定分量，从而提高了预测精度、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

Conclusion: MoE模型中的网络稀疏性可能在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更可解释的模型，挑战了可解释性与能力根本对立的常见假设。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

Motivation: 现有的MSE损失函数有时无法准确捕捉预测范围内的季节性模式或趋势，即使在前向传播中使用分解模块分别建模趋势和季节性。

Method: 使用指数移动平均将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量，在预测范围内分别计算这些分量的损失，然后进行加权组合。DBLoss可作为通用损失函数与任何深度学习预测模型结合。

Result: 大量实验表明，DBLoss显著提升了最先进模型在多样化真实世界数据集上的性能表现。

Conclusion: DBLoss为时间序列损失函数设计提供了新的视角，是一种简单而有效的分解式损失函数。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化依赖（准）随机设计来覆盖输入空间，但忽略了两个关键因素：(a) 空间填充设计可能不利于减少预测不确定性；(b) 初始化期间高效的超参数学习对高质量预测至关重要，这可能与空间填充设计相冲突。

Result: 在主动学习和少样本贝叶斯优化的广泛实验中，HIPE在预测准确性、超参数识别和后续优化性能方面优于标准初始化策略，特别在现实应用中常见的大批量、少样本设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: HIPE通过信息论方法有效解决了传统初始化策略的局限性，在少样本贝叶斯优化中提供了更高质量的代理模型和更好的优化性能。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自主决策代理存在高风险，相同的模型能力仅因提示框架不同就会产生截然不同的结果，需要架构层面的安全保障。

Method: 提出Chimera架构，包含三个互补组件：LLM策略师负责决策制定，形式化验证的符号约束引擎确保安全约束，因果推理模块进行反事实推理。

Result: 在52周电商模拟中，Chimera实现了最高收益（152万和196万美元，部分情况达220万美元）和品牌信任提升（+1.8%和+10.8%，部分情况+20.86%），而纯LLM代理会导致灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 架构设计而非提示工程决定了自主代理在生产环境中的可靠性，神经-符号-因果集成是实现稳健自主决策的关键。

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

Motivation: 机器学习系统越来越多地影响重要决策，但由于开发时缺乏明确的公平性考虑，存在歧视性影响的风险。

Method: 通过改进公平性测量方法、系统性地分解机器学习系统以预测偏差动态，以及开发有效的干预措施。

Result: 建立了更合适的公平性测量框架，能够减少算法歧视同时保持系统效用。

Abstract: This PhD thesis investigates the societal impact of machine learning (ML). ML
increasingly informs consequential decisions and recommendations, significantly
affecting many aspects of our lives. As these data-driven systems are often
developed without explicit fairness considerations, they carry the risk of
discriminatory effects. The contributions in this thesis enable more
appropriate measurement of fairness in ML systems, systematic decomposition of
ML systems to anticipate bias dynamics, and effective interventions that reduce
algorithmic discrimination while maintaining system utility. I conclude by
discussing ongoing challenges and future research directions as ML systems,
including generative artificial intelligence, become increasingly integrated
into society. This work offers a foundation for ensuring that ML's societal
impact aligns with broader social values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在复杂任务如讽刺检测上表现不佳，需要识别跨模态相关线索并进行语用推理来推断说话者意图。

Method: 引入MUStReason诊断基准，包含模态特定相关线索标注和推理步骤；提出PragCoT框架，将问题分解为感知和推理两个部分，引导模型关注隐含意图而非字面意义。

Result: 通过MUStReason对视频语言模型进行讽刺分类性能基准测试，并对生成推理进行定量和定性评估。

Conclusion: PragCoT框架能够有效提升视频语言模型在讽刺检测任务中的表现，通过关注隐含意图这一讽刺检测的核心属性。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对齐技术（如人类反馈强化学习）中的奖励模型经常利用虚假相关性（如响应长度、歧视、谄媚等），这个问题日益受到关注。

Method: 首先构建数据生成过程的形式化描述，假设观测数据来自虚假和非虚假潜在变量。然后使用变分推断恢复这些变量，并利用它们训练奖励模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效缓解虚假相关性问题，产生更鲁棒的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够理论识别非虚假潜在变量，并在实践中有效减轻奖励模型中的偏见，同时保持真实偏好的表达。

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Cobweb/4V模型在持续学习中抵抗灾难性遗忘的机制，提出了三个假设：自适应结构重组、稀疏选择性更新和信息理论学习的优势，并通过与神经基线的比较验证了这些假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的核心挑战，先前开发的Cobweb/4V模型在视觉领域表现出对灾难性遗忘的鲁棒性，这促使研究者探索其背后的机制。

Method: 通过比较Cobweb/4V与神经基线（包括新提出的CobwebNN）在不同复杂度数据集（MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、MedMNIST、CIFAR-10）上的表现，测试三个假设。

Result: 实验表明：自适应结构重组增强了学习可塑性，稀疏更新有助于减少干扰，信息理论学习过程能够在不重新访问过去数据的情况下保留先验知识。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了缓解灾难性遗忘的机制，突显了基于概念和信息理论方法在构建稳定自适应持续学习系统方面的潜力。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质设计方法如RSO依赖单路径梯度下降，忽略了序列空间约束，限制了设计的多样性和可设计性。

Method: RSS是一个马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛框架，在连续logit空间中操作，结合梯度引导探索和蛋白质语言模型引导的跳跃，能量函数耦合AlphaFold2结构目标和ESM2序列先验。

Result: 在蛋白质结合物设计任务中，RSS比RSO基线产生5倍多的可设计结构和2-3倍的结构多样性，计算成本相同。

Conclusion: RSS是一种高效探索蛋白质设计景观的原则性方法。

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统台风集合预报系统计算成本高且难以完全表征大气非线性特征，需要开发更高效的AI预报方法。

Method: FuXi-ENS采用可学习扰动方案生成集合预报，并与ECMWF-ENS在2018年全球90个台风上进行系统性对比分析。

Result: FuXi-ENS在台风物理变量预测和路径预报方面优势明显，集合离散度更小，但强度预报仍低于观测值；动力学分析显示其能更好捕捉大尺度环流。

Conclusion: 可学习扰动方案有潜力提升台风预报技能，为基于AI的极端天气集合预报提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于解释音频生成模型的可解释性框架，通过将稀疏自编码器特征映射到人类可理解的声学概念（音高、振幅、音色），实现对AI音乐生成过程的控制和分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在语言模型中成功提取可解释特征，但在音频生成中面临挑战：音频的密集特性使得压缩后语义含义模糊，且自动特征表征能力有限。

Method: 在音频自编码器潜在空间上训练稀疏自编码器，然后学习从SAE特征到离散化声学属性的线性映射，支持可控操作和生成过程分析。

Result: 在连续（DiffRhythm-VAE）和离散（EnCodec、WavTokenizer）音频潜在空间上验证了方法有效性，分析了DiffRhythm文本到音乐模型，展示了音高、音色和响度在生成过程中的演变。

Conclusion: 虽然工作仅限于音频模态，但该框架可扩展到视觉潜在空间生成模型的可解释性分析。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

TL;DR: Adam等自适应梯度方法对数据旋转敏感，可能丧失其优势，而通过正交重参数化可以恢复Adam学习复杂决策边界的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解自适应梯度方法（如Adam）相对于梯度下降在模型泛化方面的差异，特别是Adam对数据旋转的敏感性如何影响其学习复杂决策边界的能力。

Method: 分析Adam对正交变换的敏感性，并采用正交重参数化方法使一阶优化方法对数据旋转具有等变性。

Result: 即使小的数据旋转也会使Adam丧失其优势，收敛到远离贝叶斯最优的线性决策边界；正交重参数化能够恢复Adam学习复杂决策边界的能力。

Conclusion: Adam对数据旋转敏感，正交重参数化是解决这一问题的有效方法，能够保持Adam在复杂决策边界学习方面的优势。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

Motivation: 传统算子学习需要大量高质量训练数据，且实际应用中数据可能具有不均匀的离散化分辨率，获取高保真数据具有挑战性。

Method: 扩展RINO框架到完全无数据设置：使用预训练基函数将任意离散化输入投影到潜在嵌入空间；用多层感知机近似PDE算子，输入潜在编码和时空坐标；在物理空间通过有限差分求解器强制执行PDE约束。

Result: 在多个具有多分辨率数据的数值算例上验证了方法性能，包括粗网格和细网格离散化情况。

Conclusion: 该方法能够同时解决数据稀缺和分辨率变化的问题，为实际工程应用提供了有效的算子学习解决方案。

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，计算开销成为任务特定微调的主要瓶颈。虽然LoRA通过将权重更新限制在低维子空间来降低计算成本，但这种限制会阻碍效果并减缓收敛速度。

Method: 通过累积连续的低秩增量来渐进地构建高秩权重更新。识别每个更新的最优低秩矩阵以最小化损失函数并接近全参数微调。通过适当缩放原始低秩矩阵的列来实现高效无缝优化，无需重新开始训练。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分析找到最优缩放因子，有效解决了LoRA的限制，在保持计算效率的同时实现了更好的性能和更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

Motivation: 解决现有方法如PPO、GRPO在直接最大化累积奖励时的问题，以及离线方法如DPO、UNA缺乏探索能力的问题，旨在开发一个既保持在线探索能力又训练更稳定的对齐框架。

Method: 结合GRPO的在线多响应生成和归一化、DPO的隐式奖励公式化、UNA的隐式-显式奖励对齐原则，通过联合归一化隐式和显式奖励，将优化问题转化为凸的MSE损失。

Result: 相比GRPO需要更少的超参数、收敛更快、泛化更好且训练过拟合显著减少，在数学基准测试中实现了优越的推理和对齐性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: GIFT通过隐式-显式奖励对齐的简单MSE损失公式，成功解决了复杂奖励最大化问题，提供了一个稳定、高效且具有探索能力的LLM对齐框架。

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via
SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was
achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The
results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle
alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance

### [120] [Preference Learning with Response Time: Robust Losses and Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22820)
*Ayush Sawarni,Sahasrajit Sarmasarkar,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出将响应时间数据整合到人类偏好学习框架中，通过证据积累漂移扩散模型利用响应时间来推断偏好强度，开发了Neyman正交损失函数，显著提高了奖励模型学习的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于二元偏好数据的偏好学习框架未能充分利用用户决策过程中的时间信息，而响应时间包含有价值的偏好强度信息。

Method: 提出结合响应时间和二元选择数据的新方法，利用证据积累漂移扩散模型，开发Neyman正交损失函数，实现奖励模型学习的理论最优收敛速率。

Result: 理论分析表明，对于线性奖励函数，传统偏好学习的误差率随奖励幅度呈指数增长，而响应时间增强方法将其降低为多项式增长。实验验证了在图像偏好学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: 响应时间增强的偏好学习方法显著提高了样本效率，为复杂奖励模型提供了收敛保证，是偏好学习框架的重要改进。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

*Cristobal Heredia,Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出RS-ORT算法，通过两阶段优化和专门的分支定界方法解决大规模连续特征回归树训练的计算难题，保证全局最优性并显著提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIP方法在回归任务中要么仅限于二元特征，要么在处理大规模连续数据时计算不可行。简单二值化连续特征会牺牲全局最优性并产生不必要的深树。

Method: 将最优回归树训练重构为两阶段优化问题，提出RS-ORT算法：专门在树结构变量上分支的分支定界算法，结合边界收紧技术（闭式叶预测、经验阈值离散化、精确深度-1子树解析）和可分解的上下界策略。

Result: 在包含二元和连续特征的回归基准测试中，RS-ORT在训练和测试性能上优于最先进方法。对于多达200万样本的连续特征数据集，能在4小时内获得保证的训练性能，树结构更简单且泛化能力更好。

Conclusion: RS-ORT算法通过创新的优化框架和边界收紧技术，有效解决了大规模连续特征回归树训练的计算难题，实现了全局最优性和高效训练。

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

TL;DR: 提出了gCDMI方法，通过组级干预和模型不变性测试来发现多组变量间的因果关系，在模拟和真实数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法主要关注成对因果关系，忽略了变量组（子系统）及其集体因果影响，需要开发能够处理组级因果关系的技术

Method: 使用深度学习联合建模所有时间序列组的结构关系，对训练好的模型进行组级干预，然后进行模型不变性测试来确定变量组间的因果联系

Result: 在模拟数据集上表现优于现有方法，能够有效识别组级因果关系，在脑网络和气候生态系统等真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 将组级干预应用于深度学习模型并结合不变性测试，能够有效揭示复杂因果结构，为神经科学和气候科学等领域提供有价值的洞见

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前LLM中注意力机制的Query、Key、Value权重三元组是否可以被简化，探索参数冗余的可能性。

Method: 在理论分析的基础上，使用简化的GPT-3小架构（包含层归一化、跳跃连接和权重衰减）进行从头训练验证。

Result: 减少Query权重的模型在验证损失上与标准基线模型表现相当，证实了Query权重的冗余性。

Conclusion: Query权重在注意力机制中是冗余的，这一发现在大规模模型中的适用性值得进一步研究。

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

Motivation: MDP的理论分析通常分为平均奖励和折扣奖励两种情况，它们虽然相似但通常分开分析。本文旨在统一这两种情况的分析框架。

Method: 扩展了折扣奖励MDP的几何解释到平均奖励情况，建立了统一的几何分析框架。

Result: 成功将折扣奖励情况下的主要结果扩展到平均奖励情况：在唯一且遍历的最优策略下，值迭代算法具有几何收敛速率。

Conclusion: 通过几何解释的统一框架，成功连接了平均奖励和折扣奖励MDP的分析，证明了值迭代算法在两种情况下都具有几何收敛特性。

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the
discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

TL;DR: 提出FOGZO方法，结合一阶和零阶梯度下降，在量化神经网络训练中平衡精度和计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STE提供有偏梯度但质量高，ZO梯度无偏但计算昂贵，需要找到平衡两者优势的方法

Method: FOGZO（一阶引导零阶梯度下降），通过减少STE偏差同时降低ZO方法的计算量

Result: 相比STE，在相同迭代次数下：DeiT Tiny/Small精度提升1-8%，ResNet 18/50提升1-2%，LLaMA模型困惑度改善1-22点；相比n-SPSA，在相同损失下计算量减少796倍

Conclusion: FOGZO在量化感知预训练中提供了更好的精度与训练时间权衡

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 评估差分隐私机制（DP-SGD和PDP-SGD）作为联邦学习中梯度泄漏攻击防御措施的有效性，发现DP-SGD能显著降低攻击风险但牺牲模型性能，而PDP-SGD保持性能但防御效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护敏感数据不共享，但仍面临梯度泄漏攻击的风险，需要评估差分隐私机制在实际防御中的有效性。

Method: 在模拟联邦学习环境中，使用不同隐私级别训练计算机视觉模型，分析从截获梯度中重建私有数据的质量。

Result: DP-SGD显著减轻梯度泄漏攻击风险，但模型性能有适度下降；PDP-SGD保持强分类性能，但无法有效防御重建攻击。

Conclusion: 需要超越理论保证，在分布式学习场景中实证评估隐私机制，因为信息泄漏可能对数据安全和隐私构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需数据的神经网络算子，用于求解Navier-Stokes方程，无需配对解数据即可实现实时推理和大规模集合预报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维流动模型的集合模拟计算成本过高，而现有神经算子需要大量数据且难以推广到3D流动。

Method: 采用物理基础架构，以初始条件、边界条件和强迫函数为输入，生成对高变异性和扰动具有鲁棒性的解。

Result: 在2D基准测试和3D测试案例中，该方法在精度上超越现有神经算子，在集合计算效率上优于传统数值求解器，首次实现了3D Navier-Stokes方程的准确求解。

Conclusion: 通过将数值基础架构与机器学习可扩展性相结合，为端到端科学模拟和预测建立了实用的无数据高保真PDE替代模型路径。

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Abstract: In this work, a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction-diffusion model has
been developed, combining excitable-system dynamics with diffusion processes
and sharing conceptual features with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Designed to
capture the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems, particularly
electrophysiological processes, the model was solved numerically to generate
time-series data. These data were subsequently used to train and evaluate an
Echo State Network (ESN), which successfully reproduced the system's dynamic
behavior. The results demonstrate that simulating biological dynamics using
data-driven, multifunctional ESN models is both feasible and effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM象棋能力评估缺乏系统性和广度，难以准确衡量模型对象棋的理解程度及其随规模、训练方法或架构选择的变化。

Method: 创建ChessQA基准测试，包含五个渐进抽象层次的任务类别，从基本规则理解到高级概念描述，提供动态的提示、答案键和构建脚本。

Result: 评估当代LLM发现所有五个类别都存在持续弱点，提供了按类别的结果和错误分析。

Conclusion: ChessQA为诊断和比较提供了更全面的象棋能力评估框架，超越了之前简单的走子质量评估，并将发布代码、数据集和排行榜支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着训练实践和模型架构的变化，思维链监控这一AI安全机会可能丧失，需要实用方法来保持可监控性。

Method: 使用自动评分器提示词，让任何有能力的LLM计算现有思维链的清晰度和覆盖度，并在合成退化的思维链上进行验证。

Result: 在多个前沿模型的挑战性基准测试中，发现它们表现出高可监控性。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于测量思维链的默认可监控性，应被视为对抗性压力测试的补充工具，而非替代品。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

Abstract: The proliferation of probabilistic AI has promoted proposals for specialized

Motivation: 传统文本到图像扩散模型使用固定的文本嵌入，无法适应生成过程中的动态变化，限制了文本条件与生成图像的匹配度。

Method: 提出扩散自适应文本嵌入（DATE），在每个扩散时间步基于中间扰动数据优化文本嵌入，通过理论推导的更新规则动态调整文本条件。

Result: DATE在保持模型生成能力的同时，在多概念生成和文本引导图像编辑等任务中显著优于固定文本嵌入方法。

Conclusion: DATE通过动态调整文本嵌入有效提升了文本-图像对齐质量，且无需额外训练，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

Motivation: 现有模型往往低估罕见但危险的污染事件，而准确的PM浓度预测对于及时发布公共卫生预警和干预措施至关重要。

Method: 基于区域适应的transformer主干网络，结合基于扩散的随机细化模块，利用ERA5和CAMS数据集，采用领域感知目标和极值理论指导的损失函数。

Result: 模型在多个PM变量（PM1、PM2.5、PM10）预测上表现出显著提升，特别是在极端条件下，且不损害整体准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代空气质量预警系统提供了可扩展基础，支持脆弱地区的气候健康风险缓解。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

TL;DR: 提出谱变换网络(STNet)，通过谱变换技术改进算子特征值问题的深度学习求解方法，在精度上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法求解算子特征值问题时，性能受算子谱分布影响较大，特征值之间的较大差距会提高精度，因此可以利用谱分布设计专门的谱变换来提升性能。

Method: STNet在每次迭代中使用近似特征值和特征函数对原始算子进行谱变换，将其转化为等效但更易求解的问题。具体采用收缩投影排除已求解特征函数对应的子空间，减少搜索空间并避免收敛到已有特征函数；同时使用滤波器变换放大目标区域的特征值并抑制外部特征值。

Result: 大量实验表明，STNet在精度上持续优于现有的基于学习的方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 谱变换网络通过谱变换技术有效提升了算子特征值问题的求解精度，为高维算子特征值问题提供了高效的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的组合多臂老虎机消除算法，通过将臂分为确认、活跃和消除三类，并加入显式探索来更新这些集合，在组合多臂老虎机和组合线性上下文老虎机中实现了接近最优的遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合老虎机扩展了经典老虎机框架，学习者在每轮选择多个臂，应用于在线推荐和品类优化等领域。虽然UCB算法自然扩展到该场景，但臂消除方法的适应更具挑战性。

Method: 引入新颖的消除方案，将臂分为确认、活跃和消除三类，并加入显式探索来更新这些集合。

Result: 在组合多臂老虎机的一般图反馈和组合线性上下文老虎机两种设置中，该方法实现了接近最优的遗憾，而基于UCB的方法由于显式探索不足可能失败。

Conclusion: 提出的消除算法在组合老虎机中有效，提供了匹配的下界证明。

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

Motivation: 内河航道驳船数量实时准确估计存在挑战，现有监测系统有限，需要开发新方法增强海事领域感知能力

Method: 通过卫星图像手动标注驳船实例，与AIS轨迹进行时空匹配，创建30个AIS特征并使用递归特征消除筛选，训练6种回归模型

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: STG能够有效对齐模型分布与安全约束，在保持核心语义意图的同时显著提升生成内容的安全性。

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局-局部融合采样策略(GLFS)，通过结合全局和局部采样的优势，在物理信息神经网络中实现更准确和高效的偏微分方程求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs的精度严重依赖于配置点的放置。全局采样能确保稳定性但计算成本高，局部采样效率高但可能忽略已学习好的区域，降低鲁棒性。需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出GLF采样策略：1) 通过高斯噪声扰动训练点生成新配置点，噪声大小与残差成反比，从而在困难区域集中采样；2) 引入轻量级线性代理模型来近似全局残差分布，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在基准PDE上的大量实验表明，GLF相比全局和局部采样策略，在精度和效率方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为增强PINNs在求解复杂高维PDE时的可靠性和效率提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

Motivation: 现有研究假设模型输入中的m个变量是预先确定的，但如何选择这m个变量来最大化预测精度的问题从未被研究过。这在传感器预算有限的实际应用中具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了包含三个技术组件的统一框架：(1) 掩码变量参数剪枝，通过基于分位数的掩码逐步剪枝信息量较少的变量和注意力参数；(2) 优先变量参数回放，回放低损失的历史样本以保持模型稳定性；(3) 动态外推机制，通过可学习的空间嵌入和邻接信息将信息从输入变量传播到所有其他变量。

Result: 在五个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面都显著优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 联合变量选择和模型优化对于时空多元时间序列预测是有效的，特别是在传感器部署预算受限的实际场景中。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

Motivation: 克服传统投影方法的两大限制：依赖固定统计指标和假设单一数据结构，需要更灵活的方法处理复杂数据分布。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 广义损失函数PLO替代固定指标；2) 全局核PCA线性化非线性结构；3) 局部聚类处理多模态分布。

Conclusion: 该工作为异常检测问题提供了强大新工具，证明了混合多阶段架构的重要性，核化和局部化阶段的协同组合对性能提升不可或缺。

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

Result: 实验结果表明RED有效缓解负迁移，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 通过因果解耦学习视角理解负迁移，RED方法通过减少环境分歧成功缓解负迁移问题

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

Conclusion: RAP通过结合参数化和非参数化方法，生成更物理真实的预测，为复杂物理系统的长期时空预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

*Kanghyun Choi,Hyeyoon Lee,SunJong Park,Dain Kwon,Jinho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FALQON是一个消除FP8量化LoRA微调开销的框架，通过直接合并LoRA适配器到FP8量化主干中，实现3倍训练加速，无需后训练量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8量化主要对大维度矩阵乘法有加速效果，但在LoRA微调中，小维度矩阵的量化开销会削弱速度优势。

Method: 将LoRA适配器直接合并到FP8量化主干中，重新设计前向和反向计算以减少量化开销，引入行级代理更新机制。

Result: 相比现有量化LoRA方法，FALQON实现了约3倍训练加速，同时保持相似的准确率。

Conclusion: FALQON为大规模模型高效微调提供了实用解决方案，其端到端FP8工作流简化了部署流程。

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

### [150] [What do vision-language models see in the context? Investigating multimodal in-context learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24331)
*Gabriel O. dos Santos,Esther Colombini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的上下文学习能力，发现在图像描述任务中，当前VLMs主要依赖文本线索而未能有效整合视觉信息，存在多模态融合能力有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在大型语言模型中已被广泛研究，但在视觉语言模型中的有效性仍未被充分探索。本文旨在系统评估VLMs的上下文学习能力，分析不同因素对其性能的影响。

Method: 评估了涵盖四种架构的七个VLMs模型，在三个图像描述基准上进行测试。分析了提示设计、架构选择和训练策略对多模态上下文学习的影响，并首次分析了注意力模式随上下文示例数量增加的变化。

Result: 训练图像-文本交错数据能提升上下文学习性能，但并不意味着能有效整合演示示例中的视觉和文本信息。指令调优改善了指令跟随能力，但可能减少对上下文示例的依赖，表明指令对齐和上下文适应之间存在权衡。注意力分析显示当前VLMs主要关注文本线索。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在上下文学习能力上存在关键限制，特别是在多模态信息整合方面。这些发现为增强VLMs从多模态上下文示例中学习的能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个离散扩散模型的信息论框架，通过得分匹配损失来估计对数似然。推导了离散版本的I-MMSE关系，建立了信息-最小去噪得分熵(I-MDSE)和信息-最小去噪交叉熵(I-MDCE)关系，将互信息与去噪损失联系起来。

Motivation: 为离散扩散模型提供理论依据，证明常用的得分匹配损失不仅是变分下界，而是紧致的对数似然估计器。

Method: 基于信息论推导离散扩散模型的I-MDSE和I-MDCE关系，将互信息与最小去噪得分熵/交叉熵损失联系起来，提供时间积分分解。

Result: 实验验证了估计器的准确性、方差稳定性和实用性，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 该框架为离散扩散模型提供了理论支撑，证明了常用损失函数的合理性，并支持多种实用扩展。

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从多任务专家演示中学习参数化技能，以显著提高对未见任务的泛化能力，并发现具有语义意义且可适应的技能。

Method: 使用时序变分推理和信息论正则化方法，联合学习参数化技能策略和元策略，元策略在每个时间步选择合适的离散技能和连续参数。

Result: 在LIBERO和MetaWorld基准测试中，DEPS优于多任务和技能学习基线方法，能够发现可解释的参数化技能，如具有连续参数定义抓取位置的对象抓取技能。

Conclusion: 从多任务专家演示中学习参数化技能可以显著提高泛化能力，DEPS方法能够发现具有语义意义且可适应的技能，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

### [153] [Local Performance vs. Out-of-Distribution Generalization: An Empirical Analysis of Personalized Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Data Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24503)
*Mortesa Hussaini,Jan Theiß,Anthony Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为FLIU的个性化联邦学习方法，通过自适应个性化因子来解决异构数据环境下的客户端漂移问题，并在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行了全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异构数据环境中，联邦学习的本地模型会收敛到各自的局部最优解，偏离全局数据分布。FedAvg等聚合方法无法与全局模型最优对齐，导致对大多数客户端次优的更新。个性化联邦学习方法只关注客户端在自身数据分布上的平均性能，而忽略了FedAvg带来的泛化到分布外样本的重要鲁棒性优势。

Method: 提出了联邦学习个性化更新(FLIU)方法，通过简单的个性化步骤和自适应个性化因子扩展FedAvg算法。在单个通信轮次的不同阶段进行评估，使用MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集，在IID、病理性非IID以及专门设计的Dirichlet分布等复杂异构数据环境下进行测试。

Result: 通过实验评估比较了不同联邦学习方法在本地性能和泛化能力方面的表现。FLIU方法在复杂数据异构环境下表现出色。

Conclusion: FLIU方法有效解决了联邦学习在异构数据环境下的客户端漂移问题，平衡了本地性能和泛化能力，在复杂数据分布条件下具有优势。

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

### [154] [Graph-Guided Concept Selection for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24120)
*Ziyu Liu,Yijing Liu,Jianfei Yuan,Minzhi Yan,Le Yue,Honghui Xiong,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS)方法，通过概念选择和概念图来降低基于图的RAG系统的构建成本，同时保持检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图的RAG系统在构建知识图谱时需要大量LLM调用来提取实体和关系，导致成本过高。研究发现某些概念和相关文档更为重要。

Method: G2ConS包含两个核心组件：文档块选择方法和独立于LLM的概念图。前者选择重要文档块来降低KG构建成本，后者在零成本下弥补块选择带来的知识缺口。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的评估显示，G2ConS在构建成本、检索效果和回答质量方面均优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: G2ConS通过智能概念选择和概念图构建，有效解决了基于图RAG系统的高成本问题，同时保持了优越的检索性能。

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究因果CNN在多模态频率时间序列中的行为特性，特别是当卷积核长度超过标准CNN架构时，探索其与FIR滤波器的相似性和可解释性。

Method: 使用具有准线性激活函数的因果CNN，分析其在长卷积核情况下的行为，利用卷积的结合特性将整个网络简化为等效单层FIR滤波器。

Result: 因果CNN能够隐式和显式地捕捉频谱特征，训练后的网络表现出类似FIR滤波器的特性，在模拟梁动力学和真实桥梁振动数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 因果CNN与FIR滤波器的等价性为理解CNN在稀疏频率信号上的频谱学习行为提供了新见解，对建模和识别动态系统具有重要价值。

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

Conclusion: 所提框架在计算效率、样本效率和精度方面均显著优于传统方法，特别适用于实际应用中的动态负载场景

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂耗散系统在科学和工程中广泛存在，但远离平衡态时能量耗散和时间不可逆性难以从数据中量化。学习准确且可解释的动力学模型是一个重大挑战。

Method: I-OnsagerNet扩展Onsager原理，确保学习到的势能从稳态密度获得，漂移项可分解为时间可逆和不可逆分量。该方法基于Helmholtz分解原理。

Result: 应用于聚合物拉伸和随机梯度Langevin动力学，揭示了新的见解：势垒高度的超线性缩放、熵产生率的亚线性缩放，以及不可逆性随批量大小增加而抑制。

Conclusion: I-OnsagerNet建立了一个通用的、数据驱动的框架，用于发现和解释非平衡动力学。

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid
dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale
turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然实现了分布式训练而不共享数据，但梯度反演攻击挑战了其隐私保护特性。SPEAR攻击虽然理论突破，但受限于指数级运行时间，实用性有限。

Method: 应用最先进的稀疏字典学习技术，解决线性层ReLU激活的梯度反演问题，使其变得可处理。

Result: SPEAR++保留了SPEAR的所有优点（如对DP噪声和FedAvg聚合的鲁棒性），同时能处理10倍大的批次大小。

Conclusion: SPEAR++显著提升了梯度反演攻击的实用性，使联邦学习的隐私漏洞评估更加高效。

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

Conclusion: 该研究为ICU生命体征数据插补提供了比较基础，有助于促进更多机器学习模型进入临床实践。

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models

TL;DR: 提出了PRIVET算法，使用极值统计和最近邻距离来为每个合成样本分配个体隐私泄露分数，能够可靠检测记忆化和隐私泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型在敏感数据上训练存在隐私泄露风险，现有方法主要依赖全局标准评估隐私风险，缺乏样本级别的可解释性评估方法。

Method: 基于极值统计和最近邻距离，开发了模态无关的PRIVET算法，为每个合成样本计算个体隐私泄露分数。

Result: PRIVET在各种数据模态下都能可靠检测记忆化和隐私泄露，包括高维数据、小样本遗传数据，甚至在欠拟合情况下也有效。

Conclusion: PRIVET提供了数据集级别和样本级别的隐私评估，优于现有方法，同时揭示了现有计算机视觉嵌入在识别近似重复样本时的局限性。

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

*Ludovic Schwartz,Hamish Flynn,Gergely Neu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了稀疏乐观信息导向采样(SOIDS)算法，在无需贝叶斯假设的情况下，同时实现了数据丰富和数据稀缺两种机制下的最优最坏情况遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏线性赌博机算法要么在数据丰富机制下获得最优遗憾（但需承受维度多项式依赖），要么在数据稀缺机制下实现维度无关（但回合数依赖更差）。需要一种能同时适应两种机制的算法。

Method: 使用稀疏乐观信息导向采样(SOIDS)，通过引入时间依赖的学习率，在信息获取和遗憾最小化之间实现最优平衡。

Result: SOIDS在无需贝叶斯假设的情况下，同时实现了数据丰富和数据稀缺两种机制下的最优最坏情况遗憾界，扩展了IDS的理论保证。

Conclusion: SOIDS是首个能同时在数据丰富和数据稀缺机制下达到最优最坏情况遗憾的算法，并通过实验验证了其良好性能。

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the data-poor
regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the number of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algorithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, providing the first algorithm
that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the data-rich
and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good performance of
SOIDS.

### [165] [PaTaRM: Bridging Pairwise and Pointwise Signals via Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24235)
*Ai Jian,Jingqing Ruan,Xing Ma,Dailin Li,QianLin Zhou,Ke Zeng,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PaTaRM框架，通过偏好感知奖励机制和动态标准适应，统一了成对和点式奖励建模方法，在多个基准测试中显著提升了奖励模型和下游RLHF性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型存在局限性：成对方法依赖二元标签导致推理不匹配，点式方法需要复杂标注且适应性差。需要一种统一框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 结合偏好感知奖励机制（利用成对数据构建点式训练信号）和任务自适应标准系统（动态生成评估标准），无需显式点式标签。

Result: 在RewardBench和RMBench上平均相对提升4.7%，在IFEval和InFoBench基准上平均提升13.6%，验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PaTaRM提供了一种高效、可泛化且可解释的奖励建模方法，成功解决了传统奖励模型的局限性，显著提升了RLHF性能。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有的时序知识图谱预测方法多为基于嵌入的黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性。本文旨在结合高准确率和可解释预测，让用户能够评估预测阶段应用的规则。

Method: 扩展TLogic规则框架，引入实体类别作为规则组件；对于未知类别，使用基于LLM的数据驱动方法生成；研究类别预测中检索实体得分的聚合方法选择。

Result: 新规则格式通过限制规则仅应用于相关实体，实现了高准确率的可解释预测。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高准确率的同时提供了透明度和可解释性，使用户能够批判性地评估预测规则，解决了黑盒模型缺乏洞察力的问题。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

### [167] [SALS: Sparse Attention in Latent Space for KV cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24273)
*Junlin Mu,Hantao Huang,Jihang Zhang,Minghui Yu,Tao Wang,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SALS框架，通过将KV缓存投影到紧凑的潜在空间并进行稀疏token选择，有效解决大语言模型长上下文推理中的KV缓存压缩问题，避免RoPE机制导致的性能瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型处理长上下文时面临KV缓存大小和内存带宽的挑战，现有低秩压缩方法因RoPE机制导致严重精度下降或速度瓶颈。

Method: SALS框架：1）将KV缓存通过低秩投影到紧凑潜在空间；2）在该空间进行RoPE-free的查询-键交互稀疏token选择；3）仅重构重要token子集。

Result: 在多个模型上验证：实现6.4倍KV缓存压缩和5.7倍注意力算子加速；端到端吞吐量在4K和32K序列上分别提升1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: SALS通过潜在空间稀疏注意力机制，在保持竞争性精度的同时实现了SOTA的KV缓存压缩和推理加速性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方程发现(ED)的二元分类框架EDC，能够发现指定决策边界位置和形状的解析函数，在二元分类任务中优于现有ED方法，性能与最先进分类方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方程发现在回归任务中已证明成功，但需要将其扩展到分类任务，特别是发现可解释的决策边界函数。

Method: 使用适度复杂度的语法，包含线性、二次、指数项以及特征乘积项，构建可配置的模型结构以平衡灵活性和防止过拟合。

Result: 在人工和真实数据集上的实验表明，EDC能够发现目标方程的结构和参数值，在二元分类中优于现有ED方法，性能与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的语法允许灵活的决策边界而不会导致过拟合，且语法复杂度可配置，可以包含领域特定表达式。

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cluster-PFN是一种基于Transformer的模型，通过在高斯混合模型先验上训练，能够高效地进行贝叶斯聚类，准确估计聚类数量和分配，在速度和准确性上都优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯聚类方法计算量大且难以扩展到大规模数据，同时现实数据常包含缺失值，简单插补会忽略不确定性导致结果不理想。

Method: 使用Transformer架构扩展先验数据拟合网络，完全在合成数据集上训练，基于有限高斯混合模型先验学习估计聚类数量和分配的后验分布。

Result: 比AIC、BIC和变分推断等手工模型选择方法更准确估计聚类数量，聚类质量与变分推断相当但速度快几个数量级，在真实基因组数据集上优于基于插补的基线方法。

Conclusion: Cluster-PFN能够提供可扩展且灵活的贝叶斯聚类解决方案，特别适用于包含缺失值的复杂数据集。

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

TL;DR: 提出了感知学习(PeL)范式，将感知接口优化与下游决策学习解耦，使用任务无关信号直接优化感知属性如稳定性、信息性和几何控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将感知和决策联合优化，但感知质量应独立于具体任务目标来定义和优化。

Method: 分离感知接口f_φ和决策函数g_θ，使用任务无关信号优化感知属性，定义表示不变性指标评估感知质量。

Result: 证明了PeL更新在保持充分不变性时与贝叶斯任务风险梯度正交，提供了一套任务无关的感知质量评估指标。

Conclusion: PeL为感知学习提供了理论基础和实用框架，能够独立于下游任务优化感知质量。

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗等高风险领域应用时，经常忽略不确定性，即使在置信度低时也提供预测，这可能导致不可靠的结果。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 训练阶段使用实例硬度过滤问题实例优化数据集；2) 推理阶段引入置信度拒绝机制，只保留可靠预测。

Result: 在三个真实医疗数据集上的评估显示，该方法能有效提升模型可靠性，同时平衡预测性能和拒绝率，保留大部分实例。

Conclusion: 将实例硬度过滤与置信度拒绝相结合，为安全关键应用中的机器学习系统部署提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据解决了智能卡数据在公共交通研究中的隐私和可访问性问题，但现有评估方法碎片化，缺乏对群体层面变化和任务特定效用的考虑。

Method: 开发了RPU评估框架，在记录、群体和人口三个层次上系统评估合成数据的代表性、隐私性和实用性，使用一致的指标量化相似性、披露风险和实践有用性。

Result: 合成数据不能固有保证隐私，不存在"一刀切"的模型，隐私与代表性/效用之间存在明显权衡。CTGAN提供了最平衡的权衡，建议用于实际应用。

Conclusion: RPU框架为研究人员和从业者提供了系统和可复现的基础，用于比较合成数据生成技术并在公共交通应用中选择合适的方法。

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

Conclusion: APEX方法能够有效解决大规模组合合成库的虚拟筛选问题，在有限计算预算下实现近似但全面的搜索，显著提高高分化合物的发现效率。

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

Conclusion: 通过结合离线演示和在线学习，该方法有效减轻了探索负担，提高了稀疏奖励环境中的强化学习效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

Conclusion: COMBRL为连续时间模型强化学习提供了一种可扩展且样本高效的解决方案，在标准和无监督RL设置下均表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

*Yong Huang,Zhongqi Yang,Amir Rahmani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIMIC-Sepsis是一个从MIMIC-IV数据库衍生的脓毒症队列和基准框架，包含35,239名ICU患者的时间对齐临床变量和标准化治疗数据，支持脓毒症轨迹的可重复建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脓毒症是ICU中死亡率的主要原因，但现有研究往往依赖过时数据集、不可复现的预处理流程，且临床干预覆盖有限。

Method: 基于Sepsis-3标准构建透明预处理流程，包括结构化插补策略和治疗纳入，并发布专注于早期死亡率预测、住院时间估计和休克发作分类的基准任务。

Result: 实证结果表明，纳入治疗变量显著提高了模型性能，特别是基于Transformer的架构。

Conclusion: MIMIC-Sepsis为重症监护研究中的预测和序列模型评估提供了一个稳健平台。

Abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet
existing research often relies on outdated datasets, non-reproducible
preprocessing pipelines, and limited coverage of clinical interventions. We
introduce MIMIC-Sepsis, a curated cohort and benchmark framework derived from
the MIMIC-IV database, designed to support reproducible modeling of sepsis
trajectories. Our cohort includes 35,239 ICU patients with time-aligned
clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock
onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating
treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for
evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.

Conclusion: 提出的LoRA-DA方法通过严格的理论框架和高效算法，解决了现有LoRA初始化方法的局限性，显著提升了参数高效微调的性能。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

Result: 实验表明DistDF能提升多种预测模型的性能，并达到最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: DistDF通过分布差异最小化有效解决了直接预测方法的偏差问题，为时间序列预测提供了更可靠的分布对齐方法。

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Conclusion: 量子启发方法与经典架构结合可开发轻量、高性能且可解释的预测模型，推动量子机器学习超越当前限制。

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current
limitations.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个数据驱动框架，通过两种学习方法结合多域信号处理来学习健康指标，用于航空航天复合材料结构的诊断和预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于材料特性变化、随机损伤演化和多种损伤模式，提取可靠的健康指标具有挑战性。制造缺陷和使用中事件进一步复杂化了这一过程。

Method: 提出了两种方法：(1) 多样性深度半监督异常检测，使用连续辅助标签作为假设损伤代理；(2) 退化趋势约束变分自编码器，通过显式趋势约束嵌入单调性准则。使用多频导波监测复合材料结构疲劳，探索时域、频域和时频域表示。

Result: 使用FFT特征时，增强的Diversity-DeepSAD模型达到81.6%性能，而DTC-VAE提供了最一致的健康指标，性能达92.3%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效学习复合材料结构的健康指标，DTC-VAE方法在性能一致性方面表现最佳，为航空航天结构健康监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Motivation: 传统归纳逻辑编程算法通常从单次训练中学习单个假设，集成方法需要多次训练来学习多个假设。本文旨在通过更高效的方式获得集成效果。

Motivation: 时序数据中的因果发现面临组合复杂性挑战，传统基于排序的方法限制了模型表达能力，需要解决单一排序方法带来的伪影问题。

Method: 提出DOTS方法，利用扩散过程进行基于分数的匹配，实现高效Hessian估计，整合多个有效因果排序来恢复因果图的传递闭包。

Conclusion: DOTS为时序因果发现提供了一个可扩展且准确的解决方案，通过多排序方法有效缓解了单一排序方法的局限性。

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

Result: 发现当ρ较小时，稳健记忆的参数复杂度与非稳健记忆相同，但随着ρ增大而增长

Conclusion: 稳健记忆的参数复杂度取决于稳健性比率ρ，小ρ时与非稳健记忆相当，大ρ时需要更多参数

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

Method: 研究KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构特性，直接使用经验估计（贪婪采样）而非构建乐观或悲观估计。将方法专门化到BT模型，证明贪婪采样在RLHF中的充分性。

Result: 获得了比现有方法有显著改进的性能保证，发现直接使用贪婪采样就足够了，这与传统RL方法需要乐观或悲观估计不同。

Conclusion: RLHF中贪婪采样是足够的，这源于KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构特性。这一发现简化了RLHF算法设计，为理论理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

Result: 在开放世界Minecraft任务中成功率比之前最佳模型提高约2倍，在未见过的网页3D游戏中接近新手的通用性，在FPS基准测试中超越GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Claude-4-Sonnet。

Conclusion: 简单可扩展的动作表示结合大规模预训练为开发具有广泛计算机使用能力的通用智能体提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified,
scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs.
Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale
continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and
simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse
trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual
loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that
balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS
achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI如何影响科学领域的创造性问题解决，特别是学科创造力的概念及其在AI时代面临的挑战。

Method: 基于创造力哲学理论，区分创造性方法与创造性产品，引入学科创造力概念，并通过两个数学案例进行实证分析。

Result: 发现计算可以扩展学科创造力，但某些AI方法会取代学科创造力，这可能改变科学追求的价值。

Conclusion: AI在科学问题解决中具有双重作用：既能扩展学科创造力，也可能通过某些方法取代它，从而对科学追求的价值产生潜在影响。

Abstract: This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in scientific
problem-solving, with a focus on its implications for disciplinary creativity.
Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between
creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of
disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific
expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in
mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity,
certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has
the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific
pursuit.

### [192] [Multi-Environment POMDPs: Discrete Model Uncertainty Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23744)
*Eline M. Bovy,Caleb Probine,Marnix Suilen,Ufuk Topcu,Nils Jansen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多环境POMDP（ME-POMDP）模型来处理离散模型不确定性，并将其推广为对抗信念POMDP（AB-POMDP）。作者开发了精确和近似算法来计算鲁棒策略，并在标准POMDP基准测试中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当多个领域专家对问题建模存在分歧时，需要一种能够处理模型不确定性的方法。ME-POMDP扩展了标准POMDP，通过考虑一组可能的环境模型来寻找对任何模型选择都具有鲁棒性的单一策略。

Method: 首先将ME-POMDP推广为AB-POMDP（具有初始信念集合的POMDP），然后证明任何ME-POMDP都可以简化为仅在转移和奖励函数或仅在观测和奖励函数上变化的ME-POMDP。开发了精确和近似（基于点）的算法来计算鲁棒策略。

Result: 作者成功在扩展至多环境设置的标准POMDP基准测试中计算出了鲁棒策略，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ME-POMDP和AB-POMDP为处理模型不确定性提供了有效框架，所开发的算法能够计算针对最坏情况的最优鲁棒策略，在多环境设置下具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

*Laura Mismetti,Marvin Alberts,Andreas Krause,Mara Graziani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于测试时调优的框架，利用预训练transformer模型直接从串联质谱和分子式进行端到端的从头分子结构生成，无需数据库匹配或中间步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖数据库匹配或需要中间碎片/指纹预测的多步骤流程，难以识别参考数据库中不存在的化合物。

Method: 通过测试时调优增强预训练transformer模型，直接从串联质谱和分子式生成分子结构，无需人工标注和中间步骤。

Result: 在两个基准测试NPLIB1和MassSpecGym上分别比现有最佳方法DiffMS提升100%和20%，测试时调优比传统微调性能提升62%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够动态适应新质谱数据，即使预测与真实值有偏差，生成的分子候选结构仍然准确，为人工解释提供有价值指导。

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

TL;DR: 病理学基础模型在癌症诊断和预后方面表现不佳，存在准确性低、鲁棒性差、计算需求大等根本性弱点，需要重新思考该范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型在非医学领域取得了突破，但在计算病理学中的快速应用并未带来预期效果，需要系统评估其根本缺陷。

Method: 通过系统评估现有病理学基础模型，识别其七个相互关联的根本问题。

Result: 发现病理学基础模型存在诊断准确率低、鲁棒性差、几何不稳定性、计算需求大和安全漏洞等严重问题。

Conclusion: 当前病理学基础模型与组织形态学的本质存在概念性不匹配，需要对整个范式进行根本性重新思考。

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCAP是一个用于大语言模型的递归上下文感知推理与规划框架，通过计划分解、结构化父计划重注入和内存高效执行机制，显著提升长时程任务的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长时程任务中面临的多步推理和动态重规划挑战，现有序列提示方法容易产生上下文漂移、目标信息丢失和循环失败，而分层提示方法则存在跨级连续性弱或运行时开销大的问题。

Method: 结合三个关键机制：(1) 计划先行分解：生成完整子任务列表，执行第一项并优化剩余任务；(2) 结构化父计划重注入：在递归返回时保持多级上下文一致性；(3) 内存高效执行：限制活动提示范围，使成本随任务深度线性扩展。

Result: 在多个长时程推理基准测试中显著提升了子目标对齐和成功率，在严格pass@1协议下，同步Robotouille任务获得32%增益，异步Robotouille任务获得29%改进。

Conclusion: ReCAP框架通过将高层目标与低层动作对齐、减少冗余提示和保持连贯的上下文更新，有效解决了长时程推理任务中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

Motivation: 解决去中心化条件下多个自主智能体在共享环境中的协调挑战，特别是在多智能体路径规划中的目标分配问题。

Method: 智能体基于环境的结构化表示独立生成目标偏好排名，然后交换排名信息，通过固定的确定性冲突解决规则进行目标分配，无需协商或迭代协调。系统比较了贪心启发式、最优分配和LLM智能体在完全可观测网格世界中的表现。

Result: LLM智能体在提供精心设计的提示和相关定量信息时，能够达到接近最优的完成时间，并持续优于传统启发式方法。

Conclusion: 语言模型在去中心化多智能体路径规划的目标分配中具有潜力，信息结构在此类系统中至关重要。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Motivation: 现有训练算法（SFT、PPO、GRPO）在未见推理任务上泛化能力不足，且过度依赖有偏的奖励模型，需要改进LVLMs的推理能力。

Method: 将LVLMs推理重新表述为后验推断，使用摊销变分推理和多样性强化学习算法，引入稀疏奖励函数鼓励多样化高似然潜在CoT，并采用贝叶斯推断缩放策略。

Conclusion: 提出的基于变分推理的训练算法能够有效提升LVLMs的推理能力，克服现有方法的局限性，实现更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中因果效应依赖于具体情境（如年龄、国家、剂量等），需要形式化处理这种情境依赖性。

Method: 结合层理论和柔道演算，使用Lawvere-Tierney模态算子j选择相关情境，j-稳定性确保因果主张在相关情境族中构造性和一致性地成立。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在计算效率上优于经典因果发现方法，得益于层理论因果发现的分散性质。

Conclusion: 柔道演算为处理情境依赖的因果发现提供了形式化框架，在多种领域应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

Motivation: 传统LLM对齐方法对人类偏好异质性很脆弱，拟合简单的概率模型到成对比较数据会产生不一致的总体平均效用估计。

Method: 使用sign estimator方法，在聚合步骤中用二元分类损失替换交叉熵损失，在温和假设下实现一致的序数对齐。

Result: 在LLM对齐的数字孪生模拟中，sign estimator显著减少了偏好扭曲，将估计误差降低了近35%，与真实总体偏好的不一致性从12%降至8%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持现有LLM对齐管道实现简单性的同时，优于显式建模用户异质性的面板数据启发式方法，提供了可证明一致且高效的估计器。

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

### [205] [Learning Individual Movement Shifts After Urban Disruptions with Social Infrastructure Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23989)
*Shangde Gao,Zelin Xu,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个条件深度学习模型，通过结合个体的社会基础设施韧性(SIR)和空间背景，来预测破坏性事件后个体移动模式的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测破坏性事件前个体移动模式的变化具有挑战性，因为缺乏衡量个体异质性社会基础设施韧性的方法，传统特征有限，个体移动与空间背景的复杂交互未被充分捕捉，且个体级移动数据稀疏。

Method: 构建条件深度学习模型，将个体的社会基础设施韧性(SIR)纳入考虑，利用大规模稀疏个体级数据捕捉个体移动模式与局部空间背景的复杂关系。

Result: 实验表明，结合个体的SIR和空间背景可以增强模型预测事件后个体移动模式的能力。条件模型能够捕捉到具有相似事件前移动模式但SIR不同的个体在移动模式上的差异变化。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了个体社会基础设施韧性和空间背景在预测破坏性事件后移动模式变化中的重要性，为相关预测提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在组合优化问题中的潜力，特别是在传统精确方法计算不可行的大规模单机总延迟问题上开发高效的启发式算法。

Method: 开发EDD Challenger (EDDC)和MDD Challenger (MDDC)两种LLM发现的启发式算法，基于经典的EDD和MDD规则，并与混合整数规划和动态规划等精确方法进行严格比较。

Result: 对于超过100个作业的实例，EDDC改进了经典EDD规则和其他广泛使用的算法；MDDC始终优于传统启发式方法，在更大更复杂的实例上与精确方法保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 人类-LLM协作可以在有限资源下为NP难约束组合优化问题产生可扩展的高性能启发式算法。

Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization
literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large
Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)
problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a
single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We
develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger
(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date
(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that
employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered
algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time
derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare
their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across
various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than
100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become
computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD
rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently
outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact
approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows
that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics
for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited
resources when effectively configured.

Result: 在八个领域的广泛实验中，OneCast大多优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: OneCast通过结构化分解和专门建模时间序列的内在组件，有效解决了跨域预测中的泛化问题，在多个领域表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

Motivation: 随着电动汽车普及，需要理解其驾驶行为以提升交通安全和开发智能驾驶系统。

Method: 使用经典模型（IDM、OVM、OVRV、CACC）和随机森林回归器，基于真实世界电动汽车跟车数据进行参数校准和预测。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，RMSE分别为0.0046（中等间距）、0.0016（长间距）和0.0025（超长间距）；经典模型中CACC表现最好，长间距RMSE为2.67。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在模拟电动汽车行为和混合自动驾驶交通动态分析中具有重要价值。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

Motivation: 为了让医生真正信任AI，需要消除AI的黑盒特性，使其推理过程像咨询同事一样透明可理解。

Method: 创建HistoLens系统，将病理学家的自然语言问题转换为AI引擎的精确查询，生成结构化报告并提供热图视觉证据，同时训练AI只关注患者组织而忽略背景干扰。

Result: 实现了病理学家主导的工作流程，医生可以使用可信赖的AI助手验证见解，做出更快、更自信的诊断。

Conclusion: 通过提供透明推理和视觉证据的AI助手，可以建立医生对AI的信任，同时保持医生在诊断过程中的主导地位。

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

Conclusion: OpsAgent是一个实际可部署且可持续的解决方案，适用于现实世界云系统的长期运维。

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在数字-物理空间和具身智能体间泛化能力差，VLAs缺乏高层推理能力，ELLMs局限于数字空间，因此需要统一的跨空间和跨具身模型。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段通过精心策划的数字语料库向MLLM注入具身知识；第二阶段通过意图桥接接口训练策略模块，提取MLLM的高层语义来指导控制。

Result: 单一BLM₁实例在数字任务中提升约6%，在物理任务中提升约3%，优于MLLMs、ELLMs、VLAs和GMLMs四类模型。

Conclusion: BLM₁成功实现了跨空间、跨任务和跨具身的统一建模，为具身智能提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了多数据集集成的可行性，提出的UniPlanner框架有效解决了单数据集训练的局限性，为自动驾驶规划提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理方法存在两个主要问题：对历史轨迹的依赖导致错误传播放大，以及"先决策后观察"机制忽视关键界面线索的局部探索偏差。

Method: MGA将GUI交互重新定义为"先观察后决策"，每个步骤建模为独立的环境状态，包含当前截图、任务无关的空间信息和动态更新的结构化记忆三元组。

Conclusion: MGA通过观察优先的方法有效解决了GUI代理中的核心挑战，为构建更鲁棒和通用的GUI交互系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: MCTS的样本效率问题可以通过状态/动作抽象来改善，但现有方法如pruned OGA在多个动作属于同一抽象节点时使用随机平局决胜规则，这可能导致性能下降。

Method: 提出并评估了多种抽象内部策略，包括确定性策略、基于置信度策略、基于访问次数策略等，用于处理同一抽象节点内多个动作的UCB值相同的情况。

Result: 实验结果表明，多个提出的策略在大多数环境和参数设置下优于随机平局决胜策略。

Conclusion: 选择合适的抽象内部策略对MCTS性能有显著影响，提出的多个策略在大多数情况下优于随机策略。

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

*Jiayu Liu,Wei Dai,Zhenya Huang,Ning Miao,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM内部行为的自我指示方法，通过计算输入问题与输出推理路径的相关性矩阵秩来评估推理正确性，无需额外训练或复杂提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检查方法依赖外部资源（如训练验证器或复杂提示），导致高计算开销且仅适用于特定领域，需要更高效通用的LLM输出验证方法。

Method: 利用LLM内部行为，通过计算输入问题与输出推理路径的相关性矩阵秩作为推理正确性指标，设计简单的插拔式Self-Indicator方法对候选推理路径进行重加权。

Result: 在多个不同规模和家族的LLM上实验，Self-Indicator能区分正确与错误推理路径的准确率超过75%，在三个推理基准上的准确率提升超过8%。

Conclusion: LLM的内部行为已隐含其推理路径的可信度信息，Self-Indicator方法简单有效，计算开销小，能显著提升推理性能。

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于判断性预测的多智能体框架，通过不同智能体对声明真实性产生分歧并收集正反证据，使用定量双极论证框架(QBAFs)表示证据，实验表明多智能体组合能提高预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将判断性预测视为声明验证任务，需要评估未来事件的可能性，传统方法缺乏有效的证据收集和解释机制。

Method: 设计了三种基于大语言模型的智能体：ArgLLM(生成和评估QBAFs)、RbAM(从外部源挖掘关系论证)、RAG-ArgLLM(结合检索增强生成的ArgLLM)，构建多智能体框架进行证据组合。

Result: 在两个标准判断性预测数据集上的实验显示，特别是三个智能体组合时能显著提高预测准确性，同时提供可解释的证据组合。

Conclusion: 多智能体框架通过整合不同证据源有效提升了判断性预测的准确性和可解释性，为声明验证提供了新方法。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了生成式大语言模型在传播研究内容分析中的应用潜力、优势及面临的七大挑战，并提出最佳实践指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管gLLMs在传播研究内容分析中展现出超越人工编码者的潜力，但其在方法论工具包中的整合仍不充分，需要系统指导。

Method: 综合新兴研究，提出包含代码本开发、提示工程、模型选择、参数调优、迭代优化、可靠性验证和性能提升的七步最佳实践框架。

Result: 构建了使gLLM辅助内容分析更易用、更符合传播研究质量标准的系统方法论。

Conclusion: gLLMs为自动化内容分析带来范式转变，通过解决七大关键挑战，可实现更高效、可靠的研究实践。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VDSAgents是一个基于可预测性-可计算性-稳定性(PCS)原则的多智能体系统，用于改进LLM驱动的数据科学工作流，在多个数据集上超越了AutoKaggle和DataInterpreter等现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM驱动数据科学系统仅依赖LLM内部推理，缺乏科学和理论原则指导，在处理噪声和复杂真实数据集时可信度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 基于PCS原则构建多智能体系统，采用模块化工作流处理数据清洗、特征工程、建模和评估，每个阶段由专门智能体负责，并集成扰动分析、单元测试和模型验证。

Result: 在9个具有不同特征的数据集上评估，使用DeepSeek-V3和GPT-4o作为后端，VDSAgents在性能上持续优于AutoKaggle和DataInterpreter。

Conclusion: 将PCS原则嵌入LLM驱动的数据科学自动化是可行的，能够显著提升系统的可信度和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

*Silin Chen,Yuzhong Chen,Zifan Wang,Junhao Wang,Zifeng Jia,Keith M Kendrick,Tuo Zhang,Lin Zhao,Dezhong Yao,Tianming Liu,Xi Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了"类脑空间"概念，这是一个统一的几何空间，可以将任何AI模型的内在空间注意力拓扑组织映射到人类功能性脑网络上进行比较，不受输入模态、任务或感官域的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代人工神经网络在语言、感知和推理方面已能与人类相媲美，但仍不清楚这些人工系统是否像大脑一样组织信息。现有的脑-AI对齐研究局限于特定输入和任务，缺乏比较不同模态AI模型内在组织的共同基础。

Method: 通过将AI模型的内在空间注意力拓扑组织映射到规范的人类功能性脑网络上，构建统一的类脑空间。分析了151个基于Transformer的模型，包括大型视觉模型、大型语言模型和大型多模态模型。

Result: 发现类脑空间中存在连续的弧形几何结构，反映了脑相似性的逐渐增加；不同模型在该几何结构中表现出与不同程度脑相似性相关的不同分布模式，这些模式不仅由模态决定，还受到预训练范式是否强调全局语义抽象以及位置编码方案是否促进跨模态深度融合的影响。

Conclusion: 类脑空间为跨领域智能的定位、量化和比较提供了首个统一框架，揭示了连接机器与大脑的深层组织原则。模型的下游任务性能与其脑相似性程度并非完全一致。

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体生态系统用于N-of-1决策支持，旨在解决当前医疗AI系统对罕见病例和边缘患者群体表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗AI系统主要服务于平均患者，在罕见变异、多病共存和代表性不足的人口群体中表现不佳，这种平均患者谬误损害了公平性和信任。

Method: 构建多智能体生态系统，智能体按器官系统、患者群体和分析模式聚类，共享模型库和证据合成工具，通过协调层整合结果并生成决策支持包。

Result: 验证重点从群体平均值转向个体可靠性，通过低密度区域误差、小样本校准和风险-覆盖权衡来评估系统性能。

Conclusion: 通过从单一模型转向协调智能，该方法旨在使医疗AI与医学首要原则保持一致：提供透明、公平且以个体为中心的护理。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

TL;DR: Policy Cards是一种机器可读的部署层标准，用于表达AI代理的操作、监管和伦理约束，使其能够在运行时遵循所需约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为AI代理提供可验证的合规性机制，将高层治理与工程实践相结合，在多代理生态系统中实现分布式保障。

Method: 通过定义规范性层来编码允许/拒绝规则、义务、证据要求和与保障框架的映射，每个Policy Card可自动验证、版本控制并与运行时执行或持续审计管道链接。

Result: Policy Cards扩展了现有的透明度工件（如模型、数据和系统卡片），为自主代理提供了可验证的合规基础。

Conclusion: Policy Cards为大规模实现负责任自主性提供了实用机制，形成了多代理生态系统中分布式保障的基础。

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

TL;DR: Orion是一个高效的大语言模型推理框架，通过依赖感知的查询分解和逻辑并行内容扩展，解决了Web应用中高质量推理与低延迟要求的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理存在计算效率低下的顺序生成和僵化推理策略问题，无法同时满足现代Web平台对效率和质量的双重要求。

Method: 将查询推理分解为两个协同阶段：关键点生成（通过检索增强的少样本提示提取逻辑结构化的关键点）和内容并行扩展（基于依赖图并发扩展内容确保逻辑一致性），并引入管道调度机制实现跨查询并行。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Orion相比基线实现了最高4.33倍的token生成速度和3.42倍的答案延迟降低，同时通过显式建模点间依赖关系将推理质量提升最高18.75%。

Conclusion: Orion框架成功平衡了LLM推理的效率和质量要求，为实时Web应用中的AI服务提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

TL;DR: 提出了APTBench框架，将真实世界的智能体任务和成功轨迹转换为适合基础模型的多选或文本补全问题，用于在预训练阶段评估智能体潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预训练基准主要关注孤立静态技能，无法反映模型的智能体能力；而智能体基准通常针对后训练模型，基础模型难以支持多轮任务执行。需要能在预训练阶段评估智能体潜力的基准。

Method: 将真实世界智能体任务和成功轨迹转换为多选或文本补全问题，聚焦规划和行动等核心智能体能力，覆盖软件工程和深度研究等关键场景。

Result: 相比现有通用基准，APTBench能更准确预测模型作为智能体的下游性能，同时比后训练的全尺度端到端评估更轻量、成本效益更高。

Conclusion: APTBench填补了预训练阶段智能体能力评估的空白，为模型训练提供更有效的指导。

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

Motivation: 基于视觉语言模型的计算机代理在移动平台等数字环境中展现出类人能力，但其潜在的不安全操作（如系统破坏和隐私泄露）引发了重大担忧，而检测这些安全风险在复杂移动环境中仍是一个未充分探索的挑战。

Method: 提出OS-Sentinel混合安全检测框架，结合形式验证器检测显式系统级违规和基于VLM的上下文判断器评估上下文风险和代理行为，并构建MobileRisk-Live动态沙盒环境和安全检测基准。

Conclusion: 该研究为移动代理安全研究奠定了基础，提出的混合检测框架能有效识别移动环境中的安全风险，促进更安全可靠的自主移动代理发展。

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

Motivation: 现实世界中的法律实验成本高昂或难以实施，需要一种有效的替代方法来验证和发展法律理论，支持法律管理。

Method: 引入Law in Silico框架，使用基于LLM的代理模拟法律场景，包括个体决策和立法、裁决、执行等制度机制。

Result: 实验表明LLM代理能够很大程度上复现宏观层面的犯罪趋势，提供与现实观察一致的见解；微观模拟显示功能完善、透明且适应性的法律系统能更好地保护弱势个体的权利。

Conclusion: LLM能够有效模拟法律系统，为法律理论验证提供可行方案，同时揭示了良好法律系统对弱势群体保护的重要性。

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

Result: 提供了一个稳健的框架，使代理能够高效构建和维护准确的世界模型

Conclusion: 这些模式支持可扩展、自适应和互操作的自动化，适用于Web及其扩展资源

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进SNN训练的方法，通过分析替代梯度斜率设置和引入特权引导策略，显著提升了强化学习中的训练效率和最终性能，在无人机位置控制任务中取得了400分的平均回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN在复杂控制任务中面临的两个关键挑战：非可微脉冲神经元需要替代梯度但优化特性不明确，以及SNN的有状态动态需要在序列上训练，但在强化学习中早期训练序列长度有限，阻碍网络度过预热期。

Method: 系统分析替代梯度斜率设置，发现较浅斜率增加深层梯度幅度但降低与真实梯度的对齐；提出利用特权引导策略引导学习过程的新训练方法，同时利用脉冲策略的在线环境交互；结合自适应斜率调度。

Result: 在强化学习设置中，较浅斜率或调度斜率使训练和最终部署性能提升2.1倍；在真实世界无人机位置控制任务中，平均回报达到400分，显著优于行为克隆和TD3BC等先前技术（最多-200分）。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对SNN中替代梯度学习的理论理解，并开发了在真实世界机器人系统中演示的实用神经形态控制器训练方法。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的两阶段管道，通过跨任务示例和基于图的标签传播方法，减少对LLM数据标注的依赖，构建高质量ICL演示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为新颖或困难任务收集高质量示例成本高昂且劳动密集，需要减少对LLM标注的依赖。

Method: 两阶段管道：第一阶段使用跨任务示例提示LLM伪标注少量目标任务实例；第二阶段引入基于图的标签传播方法，无需额外LLM查询即可将标签信息传播到剩余目标示例。

Result: 在五个任务上的实验表明，该方法在降低标注成本的同时实现了强劲性能。

Conclusion: 该管道结合了跨任务监督的灵活性和无LLM传播的可扩展性，为ICL提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

TL;DR: FunReason-MT是一个用于合成多轮工具调用训练数据的新框架，解决了现有方法在现实环境中的局限性，通过环境-API图交互、高级工具查询合成和引导迭代链等方法生成高质量数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据合成方法（如随机环境采样或多智能体角色扮演）在现实环境中生成高质量数据的能力不足，存在目标模型训练、工具架构隔离和多轮逻辑依赖等实际挑战。

Method: FunReason-MT采用：1）环境-API图交互收集多样化高质量轨迹；2）高级工具查询合成简化困难查询构建；3）引导迭代链生成复杂思维链。

Result: 在Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3)上，基于FunReason-MT生成数据构建的4B模型在同类规模模型中达到最先进性能，优于大多数闭源模型。在BFCLv4上的进一步性能改进证实了其可靠性。

Conclusion: FunReason-MT为智能体学习提供了可靠且鲁棒的数据源，能够有效解决多轮函数调用数据合成的复杂性障碍。

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools
and documents to enhance exemplar artifact generation. Our method begins by
constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.

Conclusion: MSRANetV2是一个可靠、可解释且高性能的结直肠组织分类模型，通过Grad-CAM可视化增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM
visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by
highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate
that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural
model for classifying CRC tissues.
