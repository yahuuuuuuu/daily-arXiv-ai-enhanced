Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two.

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Preprint, under review for Eurographics 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity.

The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization.

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u548cAMR\u56fe\u5c06\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "ASP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u6cd5\u3002\u968f\u7740\u975e\u7f16\u7a0b\u4eba\u5458\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7AMR\u56fe\u89e3\u6790\u7b80\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210ASP\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316LLM\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u793a\u4f8b\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality.

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design.

Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions.

We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance.

Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression).

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fr\u00e9chet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $\u03b1$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $\u03b1$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \\emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684POMDP\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u795e\u7ecf\u4ef7\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u03b1\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u8868\u793aPOMDP\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21POMDP\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPOMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u03b1\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u03b1\u5411\u91cf\u662f|S|\u7ef4\u7684\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e2dBellman\u5907\u4efd\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528POMDP\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684PWLC\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6709\u9650\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u03b1\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u4ef7\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u4ef7\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21POMDP\u4e2d\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u662fPOMDP\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u4ef7\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21POMDP\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios.

It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail.

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior.

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684actor-critic\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u65f6\u673a\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u53ca\u65f6\u9884\u8b66\u4e0e\u8bef\u62a5\u6291\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u566a\u58f0\u5f39\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528actor-critic\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u5747\u4e8b\u6545\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8303\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u7269\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86AI\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u7269\u79cd\u9012\u5f52\u901a\u4fe1\u76f8\u9047\u65f6\u7684\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002AI\u4e0d\u662f\u4e2d\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u626d\u66f2\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u901a\u4fe1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793aAI\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u626d\u66f2\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u54f2\u5b66\u5bb6Yuk Hui\u5173\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u6027\u548c\u5076\u7136\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u7269\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5076\u7136\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u7269\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u53cc\u91cd\u5076\u7136\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7269\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u901a\u8fc7\u5076\u7136\u7684\u751f\u6001\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u800cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5076\u7136\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5916\u4ea4\u6027\u76f8\u9047\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RS-Net\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u5206\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DSGG\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u975e\u76f8\u5173\u5bf9\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "RS-Net\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5e26\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u5206\u5173\u7cfb\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728Action Genome\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRS-Net\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347Recall\u548cPrecision\uff0c\u5728mean Recall\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "RS-Net\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709DSGG\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime).

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u589e\u957f\u5feb3-5\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u589e\u957f\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4ece32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528IsoFlops\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u9ad8\u8fbe7e19 FLOPs\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u3001ImageNet\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08Fr\u00e9chet\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1a\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u5feb3-5\u500d\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u589e\u957f\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6bcf\u5e74\u589e\u957f4-5\u500d\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002"}}

Version with Appendix", "summary": "Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks.

For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\u6765\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u4e2aDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u5185\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eSOTA\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u5e38\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u5747\u800c\u7ee7\u627f\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u9762\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u91d1\u53d1\u4e0e\u5973\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u4f1a\u5f3a\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528Stable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u5185\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2aDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u4e0eSOTA\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982Group-DRO\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u89c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e73\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u504f\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

Code and data available at https://github.com/alvco/Founding_Fathers_AI", "summary": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing.

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAKER\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5fae\u4ee3\u7406\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u6b65LLM\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6267\u884c\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u7a0b\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6781\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7531\u4e13\u6ce8\u5fae\u4ee3\u7406\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u6b65\u7684LLM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5LyapInf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u72b6\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u671f\u671b\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLyapInf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u672a\u77e5Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Zubov\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6b8b\u5dee\u6765\u62df\u5408\u672a\u77e5\u4e8c\u6b21\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u4e0e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u692d\u7403\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "LyapInf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast.

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faArgus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u516c\u5171\u9053\u8def\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5404\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u5371\u9669\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u80fd\u529b", "method": "Argus\u6846\u67b6\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7ADS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f53EGO\u8f66\u8f86\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u7f1d\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236", "result": "\u4e0eTCP\u3001UniAD\u548cVAD\u4e09\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbADS\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u8fbe150.30%\uff0c\u9632\u6b6264.38%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f", "conclusion": "Argus\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u589e\u5f3aADS\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a"}}

Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model.

However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDP-PMLF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9010\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u89e3\u51b3\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u504f\u5dee\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11DP\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "DP-PMLF\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u9010\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u91cf\u5728\u88c1\u526a\u524d\u5e73\u6ed1\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6765\u8870\u51cf\u9ad8\u9891DP\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u6d88\u8017\u989d\u5916\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e25\u683cDP\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709DPSGD\u53d8\u4f53\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "DP-PMLF\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3DP\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\\%-6.4\\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\\%$ to $7\\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "OR-R1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ec5\u97001/10\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u523067.7%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6c42\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "OR-R1\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281/10\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523067.7%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6c42\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4ORLM\u9ad8\u51fa4.2%\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528100\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5c31\u8d85\u8d8aORLM 2.4%\u3002TGRPO\u5e26\u67653.1%-6.4%\u7684\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u6b21\u4e0e\u591a\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece13%\u7f29\u5c0f\u52307%\u3002", "conclusion": "OR-R1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316OR\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u95e8\u69db\u3002"}}

In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance.

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows.

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details.

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships.

However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance.

We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like \"golf\" and \"basketball\".

Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B.

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US.

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene.

Webb", "Geoffrey Mackellar"], "title": "EEG-X: Device-Agnostic and Noise-Robust Foundation Model for EEG", "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch.

As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4PCA\uff0cCSTs\u5728\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u63a5\u8fd1\u65f6\uff09\u3002\u867d\u7136\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(VNNs)\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCovariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u987a\u5e8f\u5e94\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5c42\u6b21\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5c0f\u6ce2\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8c31\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u76ae\u5c42\u539a\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCSTs\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\uff08\u4e0eVNNs\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f46\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "CSTs\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86PCA\u548cVNNs\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u63a5\u8fd1\u65f6\u6bd4PCA\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose a paradigm shift from \"model training\" to \"model raising\", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece'\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3'\u8f6c\u5411'\u6a21\u578b\u57f9\u517b'\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u521d\u671f\u5c31\u878d\u5165\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u5185\u5728\u878d\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u7acb\u540e\u624d\u8fdb\u884c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u8bef\u5bfc\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u4ef7\u503c\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5f00\u59cb\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u4ee5\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u4e3a\u751f\u6d3b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u642d\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u671f\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u8bb0\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5185\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u65e9\u671f\u5c31\u878d\u5165\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684'\u6a21\u578b\u57f9\u517b'\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fddAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u4ef7\u503c\u4f53\u7cfb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728AI\u80fd\u529b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\u3002"}}

We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $\u03a9$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $\u03a9$ drops. Computing $\u03a9$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice.

However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture.

Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions.

Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.\n  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.\n  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.\n  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5019\u9009\u8bc1\u4e66\uff0c\u5728100\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6355\u6349\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6a21\u677f\u53d1\u73b0\u548cSMT\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b100\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684BarrierBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u5e03BarrierBench\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning.

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u8026\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8bbf\u95ee\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5206\u6790\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u8026\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff08\u5408\u62102D\u9ad8\u65af\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5f69\u8272MNIST\u548cGalaxy10\u5929\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bbf\u95ee\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u79d1\u5b66\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u672a\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u8003\u8651\u6216\u7f16\u76ee\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIVO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4ef7\u503c\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIVO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u5143\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u4f18\u52bf\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7b5b\u9009\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDIVO\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u56de\u62a5\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u6311\u6218\u7684AntMaze\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DIVO\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins.

Chawla"], "title": "CrochetBench: Can Vision-Language Models Move from Describing to Doing in Crochet Domain?", "comment": "code available at https://github.com/Peiyu-Georgia-Li/crochetBench", "summary": "We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement.

However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively.

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic.

These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors.

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(CVAE)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVAE\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u5df2\u88ab\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u505c\u6ede\u4e0d\u524d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3VAE\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5047\u8bbe\u5176\u7b49\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06FID\u964d\u4f4e\u4e865%\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867.7%\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM.

We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose.

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "AuthSig\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9759\u6001\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5230\u7b7e\u540d\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u65e0\u7eb8\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u7b7e\u540d\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7eb8\u8d28\u8f6c\u5411\u7535\u5b50\u683c\u5f0f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u529b\u654f\u611f\u548cPKI\u6570\u5b57\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u7b7e\u540d\u56e0\u5176\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u4ecd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u50cf\u51e0\u4e4e\u5931\u53bb\u4e86\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e14\u6613\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u590d\u5236\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u98ce\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0cAuthSig\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u6c34\u5370\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\"\u4e00\u6b21\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u4e00\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\"\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u5199\u7b7e\u540d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cAuthSig\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u57df\u5931\u771f\u548c\u7b7e\u540d\u7279\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u4e0b\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc798%\uff0c\u5728\u6253\u5370\u626b\u63cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "AuthSig\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection.

To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity.

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWDT-MD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u5047\u9633\u6027\u9ad8\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u5dee\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728IDRiD\u548ce-ophtha\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u662f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u7b5b\u67e5\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f02\u5e38\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u5dee\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWDT-MD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u566a\u58f0\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u907f\u514d\u8eab\u4efd\u6620\u5c04\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u590d\u5408\u6210\u4f2a\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5c0f\u6ce2\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728IDRiD\u548ce-ophtha MA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWDT-MD\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fdb\u5c55\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\u65e9\u671f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u7b5b\u67e5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly.

Main paper: 7 pages with 4 figures; Appendix: 8 pages with 7 figures", "summary": "Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments.

FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts.

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing.

However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common \"ghosting effect.\" It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation.

To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error.

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b(GLP)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u671d\u7740\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes.

However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \\(l_1\\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent.

Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively.

Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)", "summary": "We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedPM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LocalNewton\u3001LTDA\u3001FedSophia\uff09\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7b80\u5355\u6df7\u5408\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7406\u60f3\u4e8c\u9636\u66f4\u65b0\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5168\u5c40\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u5c40\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f3a\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aFedPM\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7b80\u5355\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "FedPM\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e8c\u9636\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u4e86\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse.

While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728RLHF/DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u867d\u7136RLHF/DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5df2\u6709\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6b21\u6570\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u6295\u6bd2\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u6bd2\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RLHF/DPO\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods.

To be published in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)", "summary": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTERLA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u6216\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8ePPO\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "TERLA\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6bb5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TERLA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance.

Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \\Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies.

While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\u00e9rn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism.

It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation.

We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "DBINDS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u800c\u975e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u8bc6\u522bAI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53d6\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDBINDS\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u5e8f\u5217\u5f62\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u5dee\u5f02\u5e8f\u5217(INDS)\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u57df\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u641c\u7d22\u8c03\u4f18\u7684LightGBM\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728GenVidBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDBINDS\uff08\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DBINDS\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u800c\u975e\u50cf\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task.

We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator.

This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DermBench\u548cDermEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u542b4000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDermBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff084000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf+\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8bc4\u59d4\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3DermEval\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53d9\u8ff0\u5373\u53ef\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6279\u8bc4\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDermBench\u548cDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "DermBench\u548cDermEval\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFDT\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u7f1d\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6807\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u6e90\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u9519\u4f4d\u3001RTG\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8df3\u8dc3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDFDT\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528MMD\u548cOT\u4e24\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u878d\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6e90\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\u66ff\u4ee3RTG\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b3\uff09\u5e94\u7528Q\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6291\u5236\u8fde\u63a5\u70b9\u503c\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4e0a\uff0cDFDT\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f1d\u5408\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "DFDT\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u53ef\u7f1d\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u72b6\u6001\u503c\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0eMMD\u548cOT\u5ea6\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \\texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "TACO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u6765\u51cf\u5c11MLLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5199\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u63aa\u8f9e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6216\u81ea\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u805a\u5408\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fd9\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "TACO\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u5199\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u63aa\u8f9e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u9ed1\u76d2\uff09\u6216\u81ea\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u7070\u76d2\uff09\u805a\u5408\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08POPE\u3001MME\u3001HallusionBench\u3001AMBER\u548cMM-Hal Bench\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u4e2aMLLM\uff08LLaVA-1.5-7B\u548cCogVLM2\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTACO\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "TACO\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u589e\u5f3aMLLMs\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas.

We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms.

However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \\textbf{24.9$\\times$} and \\textbf{4.1$\\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively.

To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as \"Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:\", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult.

The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors.

However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters.

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\uff0c\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u8303\u5f0f\u9762\u4e34\u9519\u8bef\u76d1\u7763\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u8303\u5f0f\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u5f3a\u5316\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5728\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53cd\u9988\u5f52\u56e0\u5668\uff08\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u5b66\u751f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u63a5\u6536\u5668\uff08\u786e\u5b9a\u53cd\u9988\u5e94\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead.

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy.

Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTDCNet\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5377\u79ef\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548cTDC\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u5f31\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c3D\u5377\u79ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTDCNet\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5377\u79ef\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e76\u884cTDC\u5757\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u548c3D\u5377\u79ef\uff09\u548cTDC\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5728TDC\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u5e76\u884c3D\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728IRSTD-UAV\u548c\u516c\u5171\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTDCNet\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TDCNet\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u6742\u6ce2\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned.

Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions.

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D-3D\u914d\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0e\u672f\u524dCT\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u672f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u548cCT\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u5256\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u7aa5\u955cRGB\u5e27\u4e0eCT\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee2.65mm\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee0.19rad\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods.

Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers.

In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\\%-3\\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time.

We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u89e3\u51b3\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "ViT\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMDB51\u3001EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u548cKinetics-400\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728HMDB51\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u83b7\u5f975.95%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u8d28\u548c\u540c\u6784\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM.

However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.

However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability.

While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability.

Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the \"tunable knobs\" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast.

Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "CallosumNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u80fc\u80dd\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b50\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u795e\u7ecf\u8282\u6865\u63a5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f1%-2%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9MAE\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "GDPR\u548cCCPA\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u5bf9\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b8c\u5168\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5220\u9664\u5355\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\u4f1a\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCallosumNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff1a(1)\u589e\u5f3a\u5b50\u56fe\u6784\u5efa(ESC)\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u865a\u62df\u795e\u7ecf\u8282\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b(2)\u5168\u5c40\u795e\u7ecf\u8282\u6865\u63a5(GGB)\uff0c\u4ece\u5c40\u90e8\u5b50\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCallosumNet\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f1%-2%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9MAE\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CallosumNet\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u5b8c\u5168\u9057\u5fd8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u9ec4\u91d1\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.\n  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.\n  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.\n  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "WOODELF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684SHAP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97Background SHAP\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u3002WOODELF\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684SHAP\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "WOODELF\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6574\u4e2a\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97Background SHAP\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b300\u4e07\u884c\u3001500\u4e07\u80cc\u666f\u6837\u672c\u548c127\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWOODELF\u5728CPU\u4e0a162\u79d2\u3001GPU\u4e0a16\u79d2\u5b8c\u6210\u6240\u6709Background Shapley\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b016\u500d\u548c165\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "WOODELF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u503c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21SHAP\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE.

Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Abstract Gradient Training (AGT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u6dfb\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u3001\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u754c\u53ef\u8fbe\u53c2\u6570\u96c6\uff0c\u5373\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\uff0cAGT\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "AGT\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "AGT\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u3001\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PTE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b-\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u8fdd\u53cd\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "PTE\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u90bb\u57df\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b2) \u63a8-\u62c9\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u63a8\u5206\u652f\u4e3b\u52a8\u62c6\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u62c9\u5206\u652f\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u951a\u5b9a\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728CWRU\u548cSCUT-FD\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPTE\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "PTE\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u9057\u5fd8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness.

However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks.

This is a pre-print of an accepted paper at ICDMW: SABID 2025", "summary": "Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7279\u8bbe\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u9884\u6d4b\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u83b7\u5f97\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7279\u8bbe\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528341\u4e2aSEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec244\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8d28\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u8981SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u66f4\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u60c5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space.

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios.

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition.

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets.

Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \\textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "SiDGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u63a9\u7801SMILES\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6298\u53e0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53e3\u888b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u914d\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u4e0e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u5408\u53e3\u888b\u7ed3\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u914d\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u79cd\u8c03\u8282\u8def\u5f84\uff1a\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u4ece\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6c47\u96c6\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u6ce8\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u7f6e\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u6b65\u5e45\u6298\u53e0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7f13\u89e3\u5bf9\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSiDGen\u751f\u6210\u7684\u914d\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u63a5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "SiDGen\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53e3\u888b\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.", "AI": {"tldr": "NSL-MT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u60e9\u7f5a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6cd5\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6559\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u60e9\u7f5a\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u6548\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6cd5\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u90fd\u5e26\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f973-12% BLEU\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f9756-89%\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b5\u500d\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u500d\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "NSL-MT\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
