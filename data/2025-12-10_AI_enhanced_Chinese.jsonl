Previous approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf motion reconstruction techniques to obtain 3D trajectories for physics-based imitation. These reconstruction methods struggle with generalizability, as they either require 3D training data (potentially scarce) or fail to produce physically plausible poses, hindering their application to challenging scenarios like human-object interaction (HOI) or non-human characters. We tackle this challenge by introducing Mimic2DM, a novel motion imitation framework that learns the control policy directly and solely from widely available 2D keypoint trajectories extracted from videos. By minimizing the reprojection error, we train a general single-view 2D motion tracking policy capable of following arbitrary 2D reference motions in physics simulation, using only 2D motion data. The policy, when trained on diverse 2D motions captured from different or slightly different viewpoints, can further acquire 3D motion tracking capabilities by aggregating multiple views. Moreover, we develop a transformer-based autoregressive 2D motion generator and integrate it into a hierarchical control framework, where the generator produces high-quality 2D reference trajectories to guide the tracking policy. We show that the proposed approach is versatile and can effectively learn to synthesize physically plausible and diverse motions across a range of domains, including dancing, soccer dribbling, and animal movements, without any reliance on explicit 3D motion data.

However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, \"click-to-run\" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Visionary\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eWebGPU\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea73D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u6e32\u67d3\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u539f\u751f\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u7b28\u91cd\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u7ba1\u7ebf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eWebGPU\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6bcf\u5e27ONNX\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u751f\u6210\u5668\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9bthree.js\u63d2\u4ef6\u548cTypeScript API\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709Web\u67e5\u770b\u5668\uff0cVisionary\u5728\u76f8\u540c3DGS\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff08MLP-based 3DGS\u30014DGS\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u5316\u8eab\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "Visionary\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5185\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e863DGS\u7cfb\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8f7d\u4f53\u3002"}}

Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "ThreadWeaver\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u3001trie\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u76f8\u6bd4\u987a\u5e8fCoT\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "1) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e26\u5e76\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684CoT\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2) trie\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u6216KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u73b0\u6210\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3) \u5e76\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6559\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-8B\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ThreadWeaver\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u524d\u6cbf\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u5e73\u574771.9%\uff0cAIME24\u4e0a79.9%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad81.53\u500d\u7684\u5e73\u5747token\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "ThreadWeaver\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1(DOD)\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bbe\u8ba1(OOD)\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7A*\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7248\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cDOD\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u6838CPU\u4e0e\u4e3b\u5185\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790DOD\u4e0eOOD\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86A*\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff1a\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD\u3001\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD\u3001\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD\u3001\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548cCPU\u7f13\u5b58\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDOD\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u7f3a\u5931\u66f4\u5c11\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eA*\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u770b\u4f3c\u7ec6\u5fae\uff0c\u4f46DOD\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u52bf\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u662f\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent vision foundation models like VGGT take an orthogonal approach -- 3D knowledge is gained implicitly through training data and loss objectives, enabling feed-forward prediction of both camera parameters and 3D representations directly from a set of uncalibrated images. While flexible, VGGT features lack explicit multi-view geometric consistency, and we find that improving such 3D feature consistency benefits both NVS and pose estimation tasks. We introduce Selfi, a self-improving 3D reconstruction pipeline via feature alignment, transforming a VGGT backbone into a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction engine by leveraging its own outputs as pseudo-ground-truth. Specifically, we train a lightweight feature adapter using a reprojection-based consistency loss, which distills VGGT outputs into a new geometrically-aligned feature space that captures spatial proximity in 3D. This enables state-of-the-art performance in both NVS and camera pose estimation, demonstrating that feature alignment is a highly beneficial step for downstream 3D reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Selfi\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c06VGGT\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f3D\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800cVGGT\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u548c3D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb3D\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9NVS\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u6709\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSelfi\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c06VGGT\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u5f15\u64ce\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06VGGT\u8f93\u51fa\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u6355\u63493D\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVS\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e383D\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5c06VGGT\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u6d41\u7a0b\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u771f\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In long-tailed regimes, however, severe sample imbalance tends to prevent the emergence of the NC phenomenon, resulting in poor generalization performance. Current efforts predominantly seek to recover the ETF geometry by imposing constraints on features or classifier weights, yet overlook a critical problem: There is a pronounced misalignment between the feature and the classifier weight spaces. In this paper, we theoretically quantify the harm of such misalignment through an optimal error exponent analysis. Built on this insight, we propose three explicit alignment strategies that plug-and-play into existing long-tail methods without architectural change.

It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u4eceAI\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u8f6c\u5411\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u7406", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7e41\u91cd\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u867d\u7136AI\u52a9\u624b\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u7279\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\uff09\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u6808\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdc\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002\u968f\u7740AI\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u5411\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7406\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u6808\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7ed9\u81ea\u8db3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u52a8\u8fd9\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u548c\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u7b80\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u9886\u57df", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u72ec\u7acb\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5411\u6574\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u6570\u636e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6808\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u547c\u5401\u5411\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u80fd\u6fc0\u53d1\u8ba8\u8bba\u3001\u63a8\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def"}}

Inspired by recent advances in reference-guided image editing, we explore whether rich visual attributes from source videos can be similarly leveraged to enhance both fidelity and temporal coherence in video face swapping. Building on this insight, this work presents LivingSwap, the first video reference guided face swapping model. Our approach employs keyframes as conditioning signals to inject the target identity, enabling flexible and controllable editing. By combining keyframe conditioning with video reference guidance, the model performs temporal stitching to ensure stable identity preservation and high-fidelity reconstruction across long video sequences. To address the scarcity of data for reference-guided training, we construct a paired face-swapping dataset, Face2Face, and further reverse the data pairs to ensure reliable ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, seamlessly integrating the target identity with the source video's expressions, lighting, and motion, while significantly reducing manual effort in production workflows.

The growing availability of large-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets has opened new opportunities for applying machine learning to aerodynamic and engineering design. Yet, despite this progress, there exists no standardized benchmark for large-scale numerical simulations in engineering design. In this work, we introduce CarBench, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to large-scale 3D car aerodynamics, performing a large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art models on DrivAerNet++, the largest public dataset for automotive aerodynamics, containing over 8,000 high-fidelity car simulations. We assess eleven architectures spanning neural operator methods (e.g., Fourier Neural Operator), geometric deep learning (PointNet, RegDGCNN, PointMAE, PointTransformer), transformer-based neural solvers (Transolver, Transolver++, AB-UPT), and implicit field networks (TripNet). Beyond standard interpolation tasks, we perform cross-category experiments in which transformer-based solvers trained on a single car archetype are evaluated on unseen categories. Our analysis covers predictive accuracy, physical consistency, computational efficiency, and statistical uncertainty.

This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \\textbf{SkipKV}, a \\textbf{\\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \\textit{eviction} and \\textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \\textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\\mathbf{26.7}\\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget.

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives.

On a temporally held out test set, XGBoost and Random Forest achieve accuracies of 0.7828 and 0.7794, clearly outperforming SLMs (0.594 and 0.496); class imbalance analysis shows that simple class weighting improves fatal recall with modest accuracy trade offs, and SHAP attribution highlights human vulnerability factors, timing, and location as dominant drivers of predicted severity.

Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning.

To better understand this fragility, we ask a simple question: \\emph{do all actions contribute equally to failure?} Analyzing execution traces on $\u03c4$-Bench (Airline/Retail) and SWE-Bench Verified, we decompose trajectories into \\emph{mutating} (environment-changing) vs.\\ non-mutating steps and formalize \\emph{decisive deviations}, earliest action, level divergences that flip success to failure. A logistic regression reveals that each additional deviation in a mutating action reduces the odds of success by upto $92\\%$ on Airline and upto $96\\%$ on Retail for SoTA models. In contrast, deviations in non-mutating actions have little to no effect. Errors also grow with context length as agents drift from role and act on stale constraints. Motivated by these observations, we introduce \\cm{}, a model-agnostic, gradient-free, test-time safeguard that (i) adds mutation-gated verification, (ii) injects \\emph{Targeted Reflection} before mutating steps, and (iii) performs block-based context cleaning. \\cm{} delivers consistent gains, e.g., Qwen3-Thinking: +28\\% \\emph{relative} on Airline, +11\\% on Retail, and +7\\% on SWE-Bench Verified; Claude: +9\\%/+7\\%. We further identify ceiling effects in $\u03c4$-Bench, where annotation errors and underspecified tasks artificially cap model performance. To address this, we release $\u03c4$-Bench Verified, which restores benchmark headroom through targeted revisions.

However, due to their black-box nature, model explainers are used to help clinicians understand better and trust model outputs. This paper introduces an explainer method for classifying Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) from fundus images. Previous methods fail to generate explanations that preserve input image structures such as smoothness and sparsity. We introduce Sparse and Smooth Explainer (SSplain), a method that generates pixel-wise explanations while preserving image structures by enforcing smoothness and sparsity. This results in realistic explanations to enhance the understanding of the given black-box model. To achieve this goal, we define an optimization problem with combinatorial constraints and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results show that SSplain outperforms commonly used explainers in terms of both post-hoc accuracy and smoothness analyses.

It is well known that OoM interrupts the whole training itself and wastes substantial computational resources. Therefore, to prevent OoM, accurate prediction of GPU memory usage is essential. However, previous studies focus only on unimodal architectures and fail to generalize to multimodal models, even though the multimodal models are a common choice in agentic AI systems. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that predicts the peak GPU memory usage by analyzing the model architecture and training behavior of multimodal models. Specifically, the framework decomposes the multimodal model into its constituent layers and applies factorization to estimate the memory usage of each layer. Our evaluation shows that our framework achieves high prediction accuracy of ~8.7% average MAPE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578bGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5cf0\u503c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u9519\u8bef", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u7ecf\u5e38\u8d85\u8fc7\u53ef\u7528\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4e2d\u65ad\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u6d6a\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u9884\u6d4bGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5cf0\u503c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ec4\u6210\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u5c42\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea68.7%\u7684\u5e73\u5747MAPE\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

While AI-powered prediction applications offer a promising solution, they require a responsive and scalable back-end architecture to serve a large user base effectively. This paper details the development and evaluation of a scalable back-end system designed for a mobile diabetes prediction application. The primary objective was to maintain a failure rate below 5% and an average latency of under 1000 ms. The architecture leverages horizontal scaling, database sharding, and asynchronous communication via a message queue. Performance evaluation showed that 83% of the system's features (20 out of 24) met the specified performance targets. Key functionalities such as user profile management, activity tracking, and read-intensive prediction operations successfully achieved the desired performance. The system demonstrated the ability to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without issues, validating its scalability.

Together, these two tasks enable the conversion of continuous signing videos into spoken language text and also the temporal alignment of signing with subtitles -- both essential for practical communication, large-scale corpus construction, and educational applications. To achieve this, our approach is built upon three components: (i) a lightweight visual backbone that captures manual and non-manual cues from human keypoints and lip-region images while preserving signer privacy; (ii) a Sliding Perceiver mapping network that aggregates consecutive visual features into word-level embeddings to bridge the vision-text gap; and (iii) a multi-task scalable training strategy that jointly optimises SLT and SSA, reinforcing both linguistic and temporal alignment. To promote cross-linguistic generalisation, we pretrain our model on large-scale sign-text corpora covering British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language (ASL) from the BOBSL and YouTube-SL-25 datasets.

Recently, there is growing attention on large-scale forecasting, as it better reflects the complexity of real-world traffic networks. However, existing models often exhibit quadratic computational complexity, making them impractical for large-scale real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Mixer (HSTMixer), which leverages an all-MLP architecture for efficient and effective large-scale traffic forecasting. HSTMixer employs a hierarchical spatiotemporal mixing block to extract multi-resolution features through bottom-up aggregation and top-down propagation. Furthermore, an adaptive region mixer generates transformation matrices based on regional semantics, enabling our model to dynamically capture evolving spatiotemporal patterns for different regions.

Expected publication in 2026", "summary": "Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called \"empowerment\" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. \"Empowerment\" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\"\u8d4b\u80fd\"\uff08empowerment\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d4b\u80fd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u51c6\u786e\u56e0\u679c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u8d4b\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u6210\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8d4b\u80fd\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u8ba1\u7b97\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u8d4b\u80fd\"\u8fd9\u4e00\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8d4b\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u8fde\u63a5\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u8d4b\u80fd\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u786e\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8d4b\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u8d4b\u80fd\u53c8\u4f1a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u6210\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u8d4b\u80fd\u7ebf\u7d22\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8d4b\u80fd\u786e\u5b9e\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8d4b\u80fd\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u6210\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u8d4b\u80fd\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8d4b\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u513f\u7ae5\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d4b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u7c7b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u513f\u7ae5\uff09\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6613\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8d4b\u80fd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u5927\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This requires robust generalization to new and unseen deepfakes, which emerge frequently, while minimizing computational overhead to enable large-scale deepfake screening, a critical objective in the era of Green AI. In this work, we explore frequency-domain masking as a training strategy for deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on spatial features or large-scale pretrained models, our approach introduces random masking and geometric transformations, with a focus on frequency masking due to its superior generalization properties. We demonstrate that frequency masking not only enhances detection accuracy across diverse generators but also maintains performance under significant model pruning, offering a scalable and resource-conscious solution.

However, as the input sequence varies, the computational bottlenecks in Transformer models exhibit dynamic behavior across stages, which calls for a cross-stage sparse acceleration strategy. Unfortunately, most existing sparse Transformer approaches are single-stage based, and their sparsity prediction mechanisms lead to significant power overhead when applied across multiple stages. To this end, this paper proposes a log-domain attention prediction algorithm-architecture co-design, named LAPA. First, an asymmetric leading one computing (ALOC) scheme is designed to eliminate expensive multiplications. Next, a mixed-precision multi-round shifting accumulation (MRSA) mechanism is further proposed to mitigate the accumulation overhead. A data-feature dependent filter (DDF) strategy is designed to work in concert with the MRSA process. Finally, an elaborate accelerator is designed to translate the theoretical enhancement into practical hardware improvement.

However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability.

Doloriel"], "title": "Mask to Adapt: Simple Random Masking Enables Robust Continual Test-Time Learning", "comment": "ongoing work", "summary": "Distribution shifts at test time degrade image classifiers. Recent continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods use masking to regulate learning, but often depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores and introduce added complexity. We ask: do we need custom-made masking designs, or can a simple random masking schedule suffice under strong corruption? We introduce Mask to Adapt (M2A), a simple CTTA approach that generates a short sequence of masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts with two objectives: a mask consistency loss that aligns predictions across different views and an entropy minimization loss that encourages confident outputs. Motivated by masked image modeling, we study two common masking families -- spatial masking and frequency masking -- and further compare subtypes within each (spatial: patch vs.\\ pixel; frequency: all vs.\\ low vs.\\ high).

However, the process of disease detection is often associated with extensive medical testing and considerable costs, making it impractical to perform all possible medical tests on a patient to diagnose or predict hundreds or thousands of diseases. In this work, we propose Collaborative Learning for Disease Detection (CLDD), a novel graph-based deep learning model that formulates disease detection as a collaborative learning task by exploiting associations among diseases and similarities among patients adaptively. CLDD integrates patient-disease interactions and demographic features from electronic health records to detect hundreds or thousands of diseases for every patient, with little to no reliance on the corresponding medical tests. Extensive experiments on a processed version of the MIMIC-IV dataset comprising 61,191 patients and 2,000 diseases demonstrate that CLDD consistently outperforms representative baselines across multiple metrics, achieving a 6.33\\% improvement in recall and 7.63\\% improvement in precision. Furthermore, case studies on individual patients illustrate that CLDD can successfully recover masked diseases within its top-ranked predictions, demonstrating both interpretability and reliability in disease prediction.

The Satellite-based Monitoring Project of Deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES), a project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), stands out as a fundamental initiative in this effort, annually monitoring deforested areas not only in the Amazon but also in other Brazilian biomes. Recently, machine learning models have been developed using PRODES data to support this effort through the comparative analysis of multitemporal satellite images, treating deforestation detection as a change detection problem. However, existing approaches present significant limitations: models evaluated in the literature still show unsatisfactory effectiveness, many do not incorporate modern architectures, such as those based on self-attention mechanisms, and there is a lack of methodological standardization that allows direct comparisons between different studies. In this work, we address these gaps by evaluating various change detection models in a unified dataset, including fully convolutional models and networks incorporating self-attention mechanisms based on Transformers. We investigate the impact of different pre- and post-processing techniques, such as filtering deforested areas predicted by the models based on the size of connected components, texture replacement, and image enhancements; we demonstrate that such approaches can significantly improve individual model effectiveness. Additionally, we test different strategies for combining the evaluated models to achieve results superior to those obtained individually, reaching an F1-score of 80.41%, a value comparable to other recent works in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5168\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u548cTransformer\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u540e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fbe\u523080.41%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u96e8\u6797\u4fdd\u62a4\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u9879\uff0cPRODES\u9879\u76ee\u901a\u8fc7\u536b\u661f\u76d1\u6d4b\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3001\u672a\u91c7\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff09\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u901a\u5206\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u66ff\u6362\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8680.41%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u8fd1\u671f\u6587\u732e\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u4ee3\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u540e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of hierarchical structural semantics, which are crucial for generalization. In this paper, we propose SA^2GFM, a robust GFM framework that improves domain-adaptive representations through Structure-Aware Semantic Augmentation. First, we encode hierarchical structural priors by transforming entropy-based encoding trees into structure-aware textual prompts for feature augmentation. The enhanced inputs are processed by a self-supervised Information Bottleneck mechanism that distills robust, transferable representations via structure-guided compression. To address negative transfer in cross-domain adaptation, we introduce an expert adaptive routing mechanism, combining a mixture-of-experts architecture with a null expert design. For efficient downstream adaptation, we propose a fine-tuning module that optimizes hierarchical structures through joint intra- and inter-community structure learning.

Existing approaches primarily rely on unstructured representations, such as point clouds, voxels, or patch features, and inject scene context implicitly via coordinate embeddings. However, this often results in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to the lack of explicit, high-level structural understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary components into a Large Multimodal Model-based architecture: target-affinity token, analogous to central vision, that guides the model's attention toward query-relevant objects; and allocentric grid, akin to peripheral vision, that captures global scene context and spatial arrangements. These components work in tandem to enable structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments.

TSC tasks require models to effectively capture discriminative information for accurate class identification. Although deep learning architectures excel at capturing temporal dependencies, they often suffer from high computational cost, sensitivity to noise perturbations, and susceptibility to overfitting on small-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose FAIM, a lightweight Frequency-Aware Interactive Mamba model. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Filtering Block (AFB) that leverages Fourier Transform to extract frequency-domain features from time series data. The AFB incorporates learnable adaptive thresholds to dynamically suppress noise and employs element-wise coupling of global and local semantic adaptive filtering, enabling in-depth modeling of the synergy among different frequency components. Furthermore, we design an Interactive Mamba Block (IMB) to facilitate efficient multi-granularity information interaction, balancing the extraction of fine-grained discriminative features and comprehensive global contextual information, thereby endowing FAIM with powerful and expressive representations for TSC tasks. Additionally, we incorporate a self-supervised pre-training mechanism to enhance FAIM's understanding of complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness across various domains and high-noise scenarios.

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%.

Although Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their quadratic computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. To address this, we propose Fourier Receptance Weighted Key Value (Fourier-RWKV), a novel dehazing framework based on a Multi-State Perception paradigm. The model achieves comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity by synergistically integrating three distinct perceptual states: (1) Spatial-form Perception, realized through the Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) operation, which dynamically adjusts receptive fields to accommodate local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception, implemented within the Fourier Mix block, which extends the core WKV attention mechanism of RWKV from the spatial domain to the Fourier domain, preserving the long-range dependencies essential for global haze estimation while mitigating spatial attenuation; (3) Semantic-relation Perception, facilitated by the Semantic Bridge Module (SBM), which utilizes Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion (DSK-Fusion) to precisely align encoder-decoder features and suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-RWKV delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing a favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

However, existing methods are typically structured around scoring individual points or simple pairs. Such {point- or pair-centric} view not only overlooks the contextual nature of anomalies, which are defined by their deviation from a collective group, but also fails to exploit the rich supervisory signals that can be generated from the combinatorial composition of sets. Consequently, such models struggle to exploit the high-order interactions within the data, which are critical for learning discriminative representations. To address these limitations, we propose SetAD, a novel framework that reframes semi-supervised AD as a Set-level Anomaly Detection task. SetAD employs an attention-based set encoder trained via a graded learning objective, where the model learns to quantify the degree of anomalousness within an entire set. This approach directly models the complex group-level interactions that define anomalies. Furthermore, to enhance robustness and score calibration, we propose a context-calibrated anomaly scoring mechanism, which assesses a point's anomaly score by aggregating its normalized deviations from peer behavior across multiple, diverse contextual sets. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that SetAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51farSIM\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0eLLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u8fdb\u5316\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\"\u987f\u609f\"\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u8ba9\u4efb\u4f55LLM\u90fd\u80fd\u6210\u4e3aRLM\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236(rSIM)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0cLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "rSIM\u4f7fQwen2.5-0.5B\u6210\u4e3aRLM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8aQwen2.5-14B\u3002\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff1a\u53ea\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u6b21\u5373\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "rSIM\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u5c06LLM\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aRLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6ce8\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved superhuman accuracy on physical-based benchmarks, a key challenge remains: aligning model representations with human perception, a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness and interpretability. Research in object recognition has revealed a complex trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior, raising a question whether a similar divergence exist in depth estimation, particularly for natural outdoor scenes where benchmarks rely on sensor-based ground truth rather than human perceptual estimates. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between model accuracy and human similarity across 69 monocular depth estimators using the KITTI dataset. To dissect the structure of error patterns on a factor-by-factor basis, we applied affine fitting to decompose prediction errors into interpretable components. Intriguingly, our results reveal while humans and DNNs share certain estimation biases (positive error correlations), we observed distinct trade-off relationships between model accuracy and human similarity. This finding indicates that improving accuracy does not necessarily lead to more human-like behavior, underscoring the necessity of developing multifaceted, human-centric evaluations beyond traditional accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e8669\u4e2a\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5728KITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5df2\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u9886\u57df\u5df2\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5ba4\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528KITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f3069\u4e2a\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u5c04\u62df\u5408\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u9010\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u6790\u8bef\u5dee\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cDNN\u5171\u4eab\u67d0\u4e9b\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u6b63\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8ffd\u6c42\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f7f\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a framework using unsupervised machine learning to systematically detect suspicious trade patterns and highlight activities for review. Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML techniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare \"mega-trades\" and shipments with commercially unusual price-per-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers are combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for customs review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than general goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the most significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in \"mega-trades\" in early 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act.

Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in T\u00fcrkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks.

Inspired by recent advances in geometry problem solving that employ formal languages and symbolic solvers for enhanced correctness and interpretability, we propose GeoLoom, a novel framework for text-to-diagram generation in geometric domains. GeoLoom comprises two core components: an autoformalization module that translates natural language into a specifically designed generation-oriented formal language GeoLingua, and a coordinate solver that maps formal constraints to precise coordinates using the efficient Monte Carlo optimization. To support this framework, we introduce GeoNF, a dataset aligning natural language geometric descriptions with formal GeoLingua descriptions. We further propose a constraint-based evaluation metric that quantifies structural deviation, offering mathematically grounded supervision for iterative refinement.

Leveraging this uniquely comprehensive population register, we convert register data from 6.9 million individuals (2001-2013) into semantically rich texts and predict individuals' residential mobility in later years (2013-2017). These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate that combining semantically rich register data with modern language models can substantially advance longitudinal analysis in social sciences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u745e\u5178\u4eba\u53e3\u767b\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5316\u751f\u547d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NLP\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5c45\u4f4f\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6587\u672c\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7eb5\u5411\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u57fa\u6570\u6027\u548c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5229\u7528\u745e\u5178\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u767b\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6587\u672c\u5316\u751f\u547d\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u7eb5\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b", "method": "\u5c06690\u4e07\u4e2a\u4f53\uff082001-2013\uff09\u7684\u767b\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u547d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5e74\u5ea6\u5c45\u4f4f\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u6536\u5165\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u72b6\u51b5\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cdNLP\u67b6\u6784\uff08LSTM\u3001DistilBERT\u3001BERT\u3001Qwen\uff09\u9884\u6d4b2013-2017\u5e74\u7684\u5c45\u4f4f\u6d41\u52a8\u6027", "result": "\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6587\u672c\u5316\u767b\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u745e\u5178\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7eb5\u5411\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u767b\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u57fa\u6570\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoML in predicting compaction parameters across different soil types. The study also highlights the importance of heterogeneous datasets in improving the generalization and performance of ML models.

In these settings, inference must run directly on collar tags or low-power edge nodes built around microcontrollers (MCUs), yet most Animal Re-ID models are designed for workstations or servers and are too large for devices with small memory and low-resolution inputs. We propose an on-device framework. First, we characterise the gap between state-of-the-art Animal Re-ID models and MCU-class hardware, showing that straightforward knowledge distillation from large teachers offers limited benefit once memory and input resolution are constrained. Second, guided by this analysis, we design a high-accuracy Animal Re-ID architecture by systematically scaling a CNN-based MobileNetV2 backbone for low-resolution inputs. Third, we evaluate the framework with a real-world dataset and introduce a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy to enable fast adaptation with just three images per animal identity at a new site. Across six public Animal Re-ID datasets, our compact model achieves competitive retrieval accuracy while reducing model size by over two orders of magnitude. On a self-collected cattle dataset, the deployed model performs fully on-device inference with only a small accuracy drop and unchanged Top-1 accuracy relative to its cluster version.

The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning. The proposed framework aims to offer adaptable, computationally efficient explanations for GNNs, moving beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u578bXAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684XAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Current approaches typically yield either geometrically inconsistent multi-view images or sacrifice photorealism, resulting in blurry outputs under diverse viewing angles and complex motions. To address these issues, we propose Blur2Sharp, a novel framework integrating 3D-aware neural rendering and diffusion models to generate sharp, geometrically consistent novel-view images from only a single reference view. Our method employs a dual-conditioning architecture: initially, a Human NeRF model generates geometrically coherent multi-view renderings for target poses, explicitly encoding 3D structural guidance. Subsequently, a diffusion model conditioned on these renderings refines the generated images, preserving fine-grained details and structural fidelity.

In many scientific and engineering settings the response is functional, varying smoothly over an index such as time or wavelength, which makes classical formulations inadequate. Existing methods often minimize integrated error, which captures average performance but neglects worst case deviations. To address this limitation we propose min-max Functional Bayesian Optimization (MM-FBO), a framework that directly minimizes the maximum error across the functional domain. Functional responses are represented using functional principal component analysis, and Gaussian process surrogates are constructed for the principal component scores. Building on this representation, MM-FBO introduces an integrated uncertainty acquisition function that balances exploitation of worst case expected error with exploration across the functional domain. We provide two theoretical guarantees: a discretization bound for the worst case objective, and a consistency result showing that as the surrogate becomes accurate and uncertainty vanishes, the acquisition converges to the true min-max objective. We validate the method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and physics inspired case studies involving electromagnetic scattering by metaphotonic devices and vapor phase infiltration. Results show that MM-FBO consistently outperforms existing baselines and highlights the importance of explicitly modeling functional uncertainty in Bayesian optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMM-FBO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u51fd\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\uff08\u968f\u65f6\u95f4/\u6ce2\u957f\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6807\u91cf\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e38\u9047\u5230\u51fd\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\uff08\u968f\u65f6\u95f4/\u6ce2\u957f\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u79ef\u5206\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u8868\u793a\u51fd\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3aPC\u5f97\u5206\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u671f\u671b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5229\u7528\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1a\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u6536\u655b\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u7535\u78c1\u6563\u5c04\u3001\u6c14\u76f8\u6e17\u900f\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMM-FBO\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "MM-FBO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51fd\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6700\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Understanding objects is fundamental to computer vision. Beyond object recognition that provides only a category label as typical output, in-depth object understanding represents a comprehensive perception of an object category, involving its components, appearance characteristics, inter-category relationships, contextual background knowledge, etc. Developing such capability requires sufficient multi-modal data, including visual annotations such as parts, attributes, and co-occurrences for specific tasks, as well as textual knowledge to support high-level tasks like reasoning and question answering. However, these data are generally task-oriented and not systematically organized enough to achieve the expected understanding of object categories. In response, we propose the Visual Knowledge Base that structures multi-modal object knowledge as graphs, and present a construction framework named VisKnow that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge for object understanding. This framework integrates enriched aligned text and image-source knowledge with region annotations at both object and part levels through a combination of expert design and large-scale model application. As a specific case study, we construct AnimalKB, a structured animal knowledge base covering 406 animal categories, which contains 22K textual knowledge triplets extracted from encyclopedic documents, 420K images, and corresponding region annotations. A series of experiments showcase how AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks such as zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation. Our findings highlight the potential of automatically constructing visual knowledge bases to advance visual understanding and its practical applications.

However, such approaches remain largely unexplored in the domain of medical time series. The unique characteristics of the physiological time series signals, such as multivariate, high temporal variability, highly noisy, and artifact-prone, make deep learning-based approaches still challenging for tasks such as imputation. Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adap- tively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency over- head. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms diffusion-based SOTA works on different tasks and datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408(MoE)\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RFAMoE\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Fusion MoE\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u4f2a\u5f71\u5f71\u54cd\u7b49\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u63d2\u8865\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u63a8\u7406\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408(MoE)\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) RFAMoE\u6a21\u5757\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u901a\u9053\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6240\u9700\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff1b2) Fusion MoE\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528MoE\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210K\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u591a\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MoE-based\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline.

A key challenge lies in simulating environment agents, including background vehicles (BVs) and vulnerable road users (VRUs), that behave realistically in nominal traffic while also exhibiting risk-prone behaviors consistent with real-world accidents. We introduce Controllable Risk Agent Generation (CRAG), a framework designed to unify the modeling of dominant nominal behaviors and rare safety-critical behaviors. CRAG constructs a structured latent space that disentangles normal and risk-related behaviors, enabling efficient use of limited crash data. By combining risk-aware latent representations with optimization-based mode-transition mechanisms, the framework allows agents to shift smoothly and plausibly from safe to risk states over extended horizons, while maintaining high fidelity in both regimes. Extensive experiments show that CRAG improves diversity compared to existing baselines, while also enabling controllable generation of risk scenarios for targeted and efficient evaluation of AV robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRAG\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AV\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5b89\u5168\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u6a21\u62df\u65e5\u5e38\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u5e38\u6001\u4ea4\u901a\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e8b\u6545\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u6b63\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u4ece\u5b89\u5168\u72b6\u6001\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u98ce\u9669\u72b6\u6001", "result": "CRAG\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30", "conclusion": "CRAG\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e38\u6001\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684AV\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

However, in split inference systems-where intermediate features from neural network are transmitted instead of pixel data-these assumptions no longer apply. Intermediate features are abstract, sparse, and task-specific, making perceptual fidelity irrelevant. In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only a 1.71% loss in BD-Rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528VVC\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u6807\u51c6\u538b\u7f29\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9488\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5272\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u662f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u50cf\u7d20\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMPEG-AI\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9VVC\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u7f16\u7801\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7VVC\u914d\u7f6e\uff1aFast\u3001Faster\u548cFastest\u3002", "result": "Fast\u914d\u7f6e\u83b7\u5f972.96%\u7684BD-Rate\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1121.8%\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\uff1bFaster\u914d\u7f6e\u83b7\u5f971.85%\u7684BD-Rate\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u52a0\u901f51.5%\uff1bFastest\u914d\u7f6e\u51cf\u5c1195.6%\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4ec5\u635f\u59311.71%\u7684BD-Rate\u3002", "conclusion": "VVC\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u538b\u7f29\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u5177\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5272\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose Softly Symbolified Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (S2KAN), which integrate symbolic primitives directly into training. Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines.

Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM-WM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u63a5\u89e6\u3001\u78b0\u649e\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u4ea7\u751f\u707e\u96be\u6027\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRISM-WM\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u9690\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u5f53\u524d\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2\uff09\u4e13\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u786e\u4fdd\u4e13\u5bb6\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cPRISM-WM\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6eda\u52a8\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982TD-MPC\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM-WM\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u6025\u5267\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning.

As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures. Three case studies demonstrate IDAIF application across healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering domains.

RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure.

To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u65cb\u8f6c\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u5728\u6c34\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u963b\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u606f\u624d\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6280\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u82b1\u6837\u6ed1\u51b0\u3001\u68d2\u7403\u6295\u7403\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u684c\u9762\u5faa\u73af\u6c34\u69fd\u4e2d\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6216\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u963b\u529b\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u5185\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u963b\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u9988\u4e5f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u6d41\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u963b\u529b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5728\u963b\u529b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6280\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u597d\u574f\u53ef\u80fd\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

This bottleneck stems from a deep-rooted dependency on computationally prohibitive view transformations and bespoke, platform-specific kernels. This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the \"Deployable by Design\" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline. Enabled by a deterministic pre-sorting strategy, this transformation is executed entirely with elementary, operator native primitives (e.g Gather, Matrix Multiplication), which eliminates the need for specialized CUDA kernels and ensures fully TensorRT-native portability. Concurrently, our framework is \"Fast by Algorithm\", leveraging this decomposed structure to seamlessly integrate an end-to-end, depth-aware fusion mechanism. This jointly learned depth modulation, further bolstered by temporal aggregation and robust data augmentation, significantly enhances the geometric fidelity of the BEV representation.Empirical validation on the nuScenes benchmark corroborates the efficacy of our approach. FastBEV++ establishes a new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS while maintaining exceptional real-time performance, exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (e.g Tesla T4). By offering a solution that is free of custom plugins yet highly accurate, FastBEV++ presents a mature and scalable design philosophy for production autonomous systems.

Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the standard Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to the concept of Data Transformation Graph (DTG) that inverts the topology by modeling data states as nodes and functions as edges, enabling agents to trace logic defects through data lineage rather than control flow. We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the \"Semantic Trap\" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark.

Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations.

In clustering applications, orthogonal NMF (ONMF) variants further impose (approximate) orthogonality on the representation matrix so that its rows behave like soft cluster indicators. Existing algorithms, however, are typically derived from optimization viewpoints and do not explicitly exploit the conic geometry induced by NMF: data points lie in a convex cone whose extreme rays encode fundamental directions or \"topics\". In this work we revisit NMF from this geometric perspective and propose Cone Collapse, an algorithm that starts from the full nonnegative orthant and iteratively shrinks it toward the minimal cone generated by the data. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the data, Cone Collapse terminates in finitely many steps and recovers the minimal generating cone of $\\mathbf{X}^\\top$ . Building on this basis, we then derive a cone-aware orthogonal NMF model (CC-NMF) by applying uni-orthogonal NMF to the recovered extreme rays. Across 16 benchmark gene-expression, text, and image datasets, CC-NMF consistently matches or outperforms strong NMF baselines-including multiplicative updates, ANLS, projective NMF, ONMF, and sparse NMF-in terms of clustering purity.

To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5CITL\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u9502\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u70b9\u6dfb\u52a0\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u610f\u5916\u964d\u4f4e\u8bbe\u5907\u7eed\u822a\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u9020\u6027\u589e\u91cf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60(CITL)\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6dfb\u52a0\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u70b9\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u76d1\u6d4b\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u8fc1\u79fb\u5931\u914d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8282\u70b9\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u63d0\u4f9b\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7535\u6c60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cCITL\u5728SOH\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eSS-TCA\u3001MMD-LSTM-DA\u3001DDAN\u3001BO-CNN-TL\u548cAS$^3$LSTM\uff0cRMSE\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534783.73%\u300161.15%\u300128.24%\u300187.70%\u548c57.34%", "conclusion": "CITL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9502\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference.

To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context.

Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) addresses this by replacing quadratic self-attention with a line-scan propagation scheme, bringing the cost close to linear in the number of rows or columns, while retaining accuracy. Despite this advancement, the existing GSPN implementation still suffers from (i) heavy overhead due to repeatedly launching GPU kernels, (ii) excessive data transfers from global GPU memory, and (iii) redundant computations caused by maintaining separate propagation weights for each channel. We introduce GSPN-2, a joint algorithm-system redesign. In particular, we eliminate thousands of micro-launches from the previous implementation into one single 2D kernel, explicitly pin one warp to each channel slice, and stage the previous column's activations in shared memory. On the model side, we introduce a compact channel propagation strategy that replaces per-channel matrices, trimming parameters, and align naturally with the affinity map used in transformer attention. Experiments demonstrate GSPN-2's effectiveness across image classification and text-to-image synthesis tasks, matching transformer-level accuracy with significantly lower computational cost. GSPN-2 establishes a new efficiency frontier for modeling global spatial context in vision applications through its unique combination of structured matrix transformations and GPU-optimized implementation.

Similarly, in manufacturing, AI enables predictive maintenance to reduce equipment downtime, enhances quality control through computer-vision inspection, and optimizes production workflows using real-time operational data. While these technologies enhance operational efficiency, they introduce new challenges regarding safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance.

However, existing metric-based prototype learning methods generate prototypes solely from the support set, without considering their relevance to query data. This often results in prototype bias, where prototypes overfit support-specific characteristics and fail to generalize to the query distribution, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, which leads to degraded segmentation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning method that explicitly models semantic correlations between support and query sets. Specifically, we propose a Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) module that constructs a bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs, and generates query-relevant prototypes that better capture cross-set semantics. To further mitigate the influence of bad hubs and ambiguous prototypes near class boundaries, we introduce a Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) module, which employs a purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototype representations by pulling bad hubs and outlier prototypes closer to their corresponding class centers. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate that QHP achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, effectively narrowing the semantic gap between prototypes and query sets in FS-3DSeg.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faQHP\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u539f\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u67a2\u7ebd\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u539f\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4ece\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u539f\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\uff0c\u539f\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u67a2\u7ebd\u539f\u578b\uff08QHP\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u67a2\u7ebd\u539f\u578b\u751f\u6210\uff08HPG\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u67e5\u8be2-\u652f\u6301\u70b9\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u9891\u7e41\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u67a2\u7ebd\u70b9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u539f\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u539f\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u4f18\u5316\uff08PDO\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u4f7f\u7528\u7eaf\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u574f\u67a2\u7ebd\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u539f\u578b\u62c9\u5411\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002", "result": "\u5728S3DIS\u548cScanNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQHP\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "QHP\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u539f\u578b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional tracking schemes mainly rely on subjective thresholds, which may introduce biases in their skills on the geographical region of application. We present ByteStorm, an efficient data-driven framework for reconstructing TC tracks without threshold tuning. It leverages deep learning networks to detect TC centers (via classification and localization), using only relative vorticity (850 mb) and mean sea-level pressure. Then, detected centers are linked into TC tracks through the BYTE algorithm. ByteStorm is evaluated against state-of-the-art deterministic trackers in the East- and West-North Pacific basins (ENP and WNP). The proposed framework achieves superior performance in terms of Probability of Detection ($85.05\\%$ ENP, $79.48\\%$ WNP), False Alarm Rate ($23.26\\%$ ENP, $16.14\\%$ WNP), and high Inter-Annual Variability correlations ($0.75$ ENP and $0.69$ WNP).

Existing methods typically rely on a single prior, which is inherently insufficient to handle multiple degradations, or employ complex network architectures trained on synthetic data, which suffer from poor generalization for diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spatial and Frequency Priors (SFP) for real-world scene recovery. In the spatial domain, we observe that the inverse of the degraded image exhibits a projection along its spectral direction that resembles the scene transmission. Leveraging this spatial prior, the transmission map is estimated to recover the scene from scattering degradation. In the frequency domain, a mask is constructed for adaptive frequency enhancement, with two parameters estimated using our proposed novel priors. Specifically, one prior assumes that the mean intensity of the degraded image's direct current (DC) components across three channels in the frequency domain closely approximates that of each channel in the clear image. The second prior is based on the observation that, for clear images, the magnitude of low radial frequencies below 0.001 constitutes approximately 1% of the total spectrum. Finally, we design a weighted fusion strategy to integrate spatial-domain restoration, frequency-domain enhancement, and salient features from the input image, yielding the final recovered result.

Accepted for publication in Philosophical Transactions A. Autor Accepted Manuscript version", "summary": "Medical decision-making makes frequent use of algorithms that combine risk equations with rules, providing clear and standardized treatment pathways. Symbolic regression (SR) traditionally limits its search space to continuous function forms and their parameters, making it difficult to model this decision-making. However, due to its ability to derive data-driven, interpretable models, SR holds promise for developing data-driven clinical risk scores. To that end we introduce Brush, an SR algorithm that combines decision-tree-like splitting algorithms with non-linear constant optimization, allowing for seamless integration of rule-based logic into symbolic regression and classification models. Brush achieves Pareto-optimal performance on SRBench, and was applied to recapitulate two widely used clinical scoring systems, achieving high accuracy and interpretable models. Compared to decision trees, random forests, and other SR methods, Brush achieves comparable or superior predictive performance while producing simpler models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Brush\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5206\u88c2\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e38\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u7ecf\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52(SR)\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd9\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4f46\u7531\u4e8eSR\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBrush\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7c7b\u4f3c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u5206\u88c2\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e38\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "Brush\u5728SRBench\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u5176\u4ed6SR\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cBrush\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Brush\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

A key challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where learning new information causes the model to lose its performance on previous tasks. Recently, explainable AI has been proposed as a promising way to better understand and reduce forgetting. In particular, self-explainable models are useful because they generate explanations during prediction, which can help preserve knowledge. However, most existing explainable approaches use post-hoc explanations or require additional memory for each new task, resulting in limited scalability. In this work, we introduce CIP-Net, an exemplar-free self-explainable prototype-based model designed for continual learning. CIP-Net avoids storing past examples and maintains a simple architecture, while still providing useful explanations and strong performance.

Translating exocentric (third-person) videos into egocentric (first-person) videos opens up new possibilities for immersive understanding but remains highly challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap. This task requires faithfully preserving visible content while synthesizing unseen regions in a geometrically consistent manner. To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generating egocentric videos from a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scale video diffusion models through lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a unified conditioning strategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, a geometry-guided self-attention mechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity. Our approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation while demonstrating strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "EgoX\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u5c06\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u6781\u5927\u4e14\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u53e0\u6781\u5c11\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89c1\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "EgoX\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u62fc\u63a5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u548c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u903c\u771f\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EgoX\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u5230\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Despite the evident potential exhibited by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they frequently encounter challenges such as context dilution and hallucination when confronted with intricate, heterogeneous medical histories. In order to address these limitations, a hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework is proposed, which emulates the collaborative workflow of a human Multidisciplinary Team (MDT). The system attained a composite expert evaluation score of 4.60/5.00, thereby demonstrating a substantial improvement over the monolithic baseline. It is noteworthy that the agent-based architecture yielded the most substantial enhancements in reasoning logic and medical accuracy.

We present Physics-Aware Video-to-Audio Synthesis (PAVAS), a method that incorporates physical reasoning into a latent diffusion-based V2A generation through the Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter). The adapter receives object-level physical parameters estimated by the Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE), which uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to infer the moving-object mass and a segmentation-based dynamic 3D reconstruction module to recover its motion trajectory for velocity computation. These physical cues enable the model to synthesize sounds that reflect underlying physical factors. To assess physical realism, we curate VGG-Impact, a benchmark focusing on object-object interactions, and introduce Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient (APCC), an evaluation metric that measures consistency between physical and auditory attributes. Comprehensive experiments show that PAVAS produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, outperforming existing V2A models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

This paper proposes a new paradigm of \"human-AI collaborative cognitive enhancement,\" aiming to transform the dual black boxes into a composable, auditable, and extensible \"functional white-box\" system through structured \"meta-interaction.\" The core breakthrough lies in the \"plug-and-play cognitive framework\"--a computable knowledge package that can be extracted from expert dialogues and loaded into the Recursive Adversarial Meta-Thinking Network (RAMTN). This enables expert thinking, such as medical diagnostic logic and teaching intuition, to be converted into reusable and scalable public assets, realizing a paradigm shift from \"AI as a tool\" to \"AI as a thinking partner.\" This work not only provides the first engineering proof for \"cognitive equity\" but also opens up a new path for AI governance: constructing a verifiable and intervenable governance paradigm through \"transparency of interaction protocols\" rather than prying into the internal mechanisms of models. The framework is open-sourced to promote technology for good and cognitive inclusion. This paper is an independent exploratory research conducted by the author.

(iii) Identity-Preserving Reference Image Synthesis. We introduce segmentation map-guided outpainting to synthesize the input images for subject-driven generation and box-guided inpainting to generate input images for subject-driven manipulation, together with geometry-aware augmentations and irregular boundary erosion. (iv) Verification and Captioning. We utilize a VLM to validate synthesized samples, re-synthesize failed samples based on stage (iii), and then construct short and long captions.

Single-objective Reinforcement Learning approaches typically address this by optimizing a fixed scalarized reward function, resulting in rigid policies that fail to adapt to varying clinical priorities. Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) offers a solution by learning a set of optimal policies along the Pareto Frontier, allowing for dynamic preference selection at test time. However, applying MORL in healthcare necessitates strict offline learning from historical data.\n  In this paper, we benchmark three offline MORL algorithms, Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, and a modified Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) Decision Transformer (PEDA DT), against three scalarized single-objective baselines (BC, CQL, and DDQN) on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) metrics, we demonstrate that PEDA DT algorithm offers superior flexibility compared to static scalarized baselines. Notably, our results extend previous findings on single-objective Decision Transformers in healthcare, confirming that sequence modeling architectures remain robust and effective when scaled to multi-objective conditioned generation. These findings suggest that offline MORL is a promising framework for enabling personalized, adjustable decision-making in critical care without the need for retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728ICU\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0PEDA DT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "ICU\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u9700\u8981\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\uff08\u5982\u4f4f\u9662\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u50f5\u5316\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u5728MIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u79bb\u7ebfMORL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u5b88\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258Q\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CPQL\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94CPQL\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u9ad8\u6548\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee3\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08PEDA DT\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08BC\u3001CQL\u548cDDQN\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08OPE\uff09\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "PEDA DT\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u4f9d\u7136\u7a33\u5065\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u751f\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u6210\u4e3aAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\"\u5927\u8111\"\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982GUI\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u662f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf941\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u539f\u751f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8003\u8651\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

While world models (WMs) offer a paradigm for generative prediction, existing medical applications remain limited. Existing methods often rely on stochastic diffusion models, focusing on visual reconstruction rather than causal, physiological transitions. Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans. Finally, CLARITY introduces a novel prediction-to-decision framework, translating latent rollouts into transparent, actionable recommendations. CLARITY demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in treatment planning.

Despite their promising potential, a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has not been thoroughly investigated. This letter presents a detailed performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in three-dimensional wireless environments. Accurate channel models incorporating directional radiation patterns are established, and the influence of deployment altitude and orientation is thoroughly examined. To optimize the system sum-rate, we formulate joint optimization problems for both architectures and propose an efficient solution based on the weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms. Simulation results reveal that STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, whereas RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes.

Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \\textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art data distillation methods and remains effective across various distribution-matching strategies for the single geometries.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoDM\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u3001\u53cc\u66f2\u548c\u7403\u9762\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u79ef\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u6355\u83b7\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u635f\u5931\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u66f2\u7387\uff09\u3002\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeoDM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u3001\u53cc\u66f2\u548c\u7403\u9762\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u79ef\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u9002\u5e94\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u635f\u5931\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e58\u79ef\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u6bd4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5bf9\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5355\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoDM\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u5f62\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u83b7\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While linear attention mechanisms reduce this cost to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, they typically rely on fixed random feature maps, such as random Fourier features or hand-crafted functions. This reliance on static, data-agnostic kernels creates a fundamental trade-off, forcing practitioners to sacrifice significant model accuracy for computational efficiency. We introduce \\textsc{LUNA}, a kernelized linear attention mechanism that eliminates this trade-off, retaining linear cost while matching and surpassing the accuracy of quadratic attention. \\textsc{LUNA} is built on the key insight that the kernel feature map itself should be learned rather than fixed a priori. By parameterizing the kernel, \\textsc{LUNA} learns a feature basis tailored to the specific data and task, overcoming the expressive limitations of fixed-feature methods. \\textsc{Luna} implements this with a learnable feature map that induces a positive-definite kernel and admits a streaming form, yielding linear time and memory scaling in the sequence length. Empirical evaluations validate our approach across diverse settings. On the Long Range Arena (LRA), \\textsc{Luna} achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy among efficient Transformers under compute parity, using the same parameter count, training steps, and approximate FLOPs. \\textsc{Luna} also excels at post-hoc conversion: replacing softmax in fine-tuned BERT and ViT-B/16 checkpoints and briefly fine-tuning recovers most of the original performance, substantially outperforming fixed linearizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "LUNA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u6838\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4e8c\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfsoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5177\u6709O(n\u00b2)\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u867d\u7136\u5c06\u6210\u672c\u964d\u81f3O(n)\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\uff08\u5982\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u727a\u7272\u3002", "method": "LUNA\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u8ba9\u6838\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0cLUNA\u5b66\u4e60\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u8be5\u6620\u5c04\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u6b63\u5b9a\u6838\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6d41\u5f0f\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728Long Range Arena\uff08LRA\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLUNA\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3cFLOPs\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u540e\u8f6c\u6362\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684BERT\u548cViT-B/16\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u4e2d\u7684softmax\u66ff\u6362\u4e3aLUNA\u5e76\u7b80\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u59cb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LUNA\u6210\u529f\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7Agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u3001\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740Agentic AI\u5728\u5404\u884c\u4e1a\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9762\u4e34\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u7684Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u7b26\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae(MCP)\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u8003\u8651\u3001\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e5d\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5a92\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5065\u58ee\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u5c31\u7eea\u7684Agentic AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b9e\u65bd\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7Agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5e94\u5bf9Agentic AI\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Their precise identification enables advanced diagnostics, facilitates personalized treatment strategies, and supports more effective monitoring of treatment progress in clinical dentistry. However, several significant challenges may arise due to the intricate geometry of individual teeth and the substantial variations observed across different individuals. To address these complexities, the development of advanced techniques, especially through the application of deep learning, is essential for the precise and reliable detection of 3D tooth landmarks. In this context, the 3DTeethLand challenge was held in collaboration with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2024, calling for algorithms focused on teeth landmark detection from intraoral 3D scans. This challenge introduced the first publicly available dataset for 3D teeth landmark detection, offering a valuable resource to assess the state-of-the-art methods in this task and encourage the community to provide methodological contributions towards the resolution of their problem with significant clinical implications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e863DTeethLand\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u53e3\u8154\u51853D\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u7259\u9f7f\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u7259\u9f7f\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u7259\u9f7f\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e34\u5e8a\u6b63\u7578\u5b66\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u8fdb\u5c55\u76d1\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7259\u9f7f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u7ed9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u7ec73DTeethLand\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\uff0c\u4e0e\u56fd\u9645\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5e72\u9884\u4f1a\u8bae\uff08MICCAI\uff09\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f81\u96c6\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4ece\u53e3\u8154\u51853D\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7259\u9f7f\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u76843D\u7259\u9f7f\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u76843D\u7259\u9f7f\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "3DTeethLand\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e863D\u7259\u9f7f\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e34\u5e8a\u6b63\u7578\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

If a data point has nonzero weight only for one cluster, then its predicted CIFs correspond to those of the classical Aalen-Johansen estimator restricted to data points from that cluster.

Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARLoS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LoRA\u8868\u5f81\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u6790650\u591a\u4e2aLoRA\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u8868\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7248\u6743\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e9e\u5927\u4f46\u65e0\u5e8f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63cf\u8ff0\u6216\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790650\u591a\u4e2aLoRA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u5f81\uff1a\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff09\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u6548\u679c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u76f8\u5173LoRA\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8fc7\u5f3a\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684LoRA\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CARLoS\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684LoRA\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u8fd8\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u5206\u6790\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7248\u6743\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u610f\u613f\u6027\u7b49\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdbLoRA\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Recently, existing mainstream Eulerian approaches address amplification-induced noise via decoupling representation learning such as texture, shape and frequancey schemes, but they still struggle to separate photon noise from true micro-motion when motion displacements are very small. We propose GeoDiffMM, a novel diffusion-based Lagrangian VMM framework conditioned on optical flow as a geometric cue, enabling structurally consistent motion magnification. Specifically, we design a Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation strategy that synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise as supervision, helping the model learn more accurate geometry-aware optial flow and generalize better. Next, we develop a Diffusion Motion Magnifier that conditions the denoising process on (i) optical flow as a geometry prior and (ii) a learnable magnification factor controlling magnitude, thereby selectively amplifying motion components consistent with scene semantics and structure while suppressing content-irrelevant perturbations. Finally, we perform Flow-based Video Synthesis to map the amplified motion back to the image domain with high fidelity.

However, the wide variation in crisis types makes achieving generalizable performance across unseen disasters a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily leverage deep learning to fuse textual and visual cues for crisis classification, achieving numerically plausible results under in-domain settings. However, they exhibit poor generalization across unseen crisis types because they 1. do not disentangle spurious and causal features, resulting in performance degradation under domain shift, and 2. fail to align heterogeneous modality representations within a shared space, which hinders the direct adaptation of established single-modality domain generalization (DG) techniques to the multimodal setting. To address these issues, we introduce a causality-guided multimodal domain generalization (MMDG) framework that combines adversarial disentanglement with unified representation learning for crisis classification. The adversarial objective encourages the model to disentangle and focus on domain-invariant causal features, leading to more generalizable classifications grounded in stable causal mechanisms. The unified representation aligns features from different modalities within a shared latent space, enabling single-modality DG strategies to be seamlessly extended to multimodal learning. Experiments on the different datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance in unseen disaster scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u7f20\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5371\u673a\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u707e\u96be\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5371\u673a\u5206\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u707e\u96be\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002\u539f\u56e0\u6709\u4e8c\uff1a1) \u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u7f20\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b2) \u672a\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5411\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u7f20\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u76ee\u6807\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7f20\u5e76\u5173\u6ce8\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u707e\u96be\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5371\u673a\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u707e\u96be\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For the purpose of promoting low-rank structures resulting from strongly correlated color channels, a quaternion nuclear norm regularization term, serving as a natural extension of the conventional matrix nuclear norm to the quaternion domain, is added to the hinge loss in our LSQMM model. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based iterative algorithm is designed to effectively resolve the proposed quaternion optimization model. Experimental results on multiple color image classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed classification approach exhibits advantages in classification accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency, compared to several state-of-the-art methods using support vector machines, support matrix machines, and support tensor machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u652f\u6301\u56db\u5143\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u673a\uff08LSQMM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06RGB\u901a\u9053\u89c6\u4e3a\u7eaf\u56db\u5143\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u5143\u6570\u4ee3\u6570\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u56db\u5143\u6570\u6838\u8303\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u77e9\u9635\u6216\u4e09\u9636\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528RGB\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u53d7\u56db\u5143\u6570\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u548c\u53bb\u566a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLSQMM\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06RGB\u901a\u9053\u89c6\u4e3a\u7eaf\u56db\u5143\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56db\u5143\u6570\u4ee3\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u9053\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u6dfb\u52a0\u56db\u5143\u6570\u6838\u8303\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff08\u4f20\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u6838\u8303\u6570\u5728\u56db\u5143\u6570\u57df\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff09\u5230\u94f0\u94fe\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u989c\u8272\u901a\u9053\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8eADMM\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u56db\u5143\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u3001\u652f\u6301\u77e9\u9635\u673a\u548c\u652f\u6301\u5f20\u91cf\u673a\u7b49\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cLSQMM\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "LSQMM\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u5143\u6570\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Recent advances in large language model (LLM) architectures have yielded chemistry language models (CLMs) with impressive capabilities in molecular property prediction and molecular generation. However, how these models internally represent chemical knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we extend sparse autoencoder techniques to uncover and examine interpretable features within CLMs. Applying our methodology to the Foundation Models for Materials (FM4M) SMI-TED chemistry foundation model, we extract semantically meaningful latent features and analyse their activation patterns across diverse molecular datasets. Our findings reveal that these models encode a rich landscape of chemical concepts. We identify correlations between specific latent features and distinct domains of chemical knowledge, including structural motifs, physicochemical properties, and pharmacological drug classes.

While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable. This work advances the interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs the design of future defenses and detection strategies for generative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86Glaze\u548cNightshade\u7b49\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u71b5\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4f55\u4fdd\u62a4\u4fe1\u53f7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u5fae\u5999\u4f46\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136Glaze\u548cNightshade\u7b49\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u884c\u4e3a\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u5206\u6790\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u767d\u76d2\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\uff08\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u906e\u6321\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6620\u5c04\uff09\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\uff08\u9891\u57df\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u71b5\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u4fdd\u62a4\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u7559\u5185\u5bb9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u53d7\u6270\u52a8\u71b5\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u9891\u7387\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\uff1bGlaze\u548cNightshade\u6cbf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u9891\u7387\u8f74\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u53d8\u5f62\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u4f4d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4fdd\u62a4\u4fe1\u53f7\u89c6\u89c9\u5fae\u5999\u4f46\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u751f\u6210AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance.

However, existing methods face difficulties in representing 3D data because of its unordered and uneven density. Through an in-depth analysis of mainstream contrastive and generative approaches, we find that contrastive models tend to suffer from overfitting, while 3D Mask Autoencoders struggle to handle unordered point clouds. This motivates us to learn 3D representations by sharing the merits of diffusion and contrast models, which is non-trivial due to the pattern difference between the two paradigms. In this paper, we propose \\textit{PointDico}, a novel model that seamlessly integrates these methods. \\textit{PointDico} learns from both denoising generative modeling and cross-modal contrastive learning through knowledge distillation, where the diffusion model serves as a guide for the contrastive model. We introduce a hierarchical pyramid conditional generator for multi-scale geometric feature extraction and employ a dual-channel design to effectively integrate local and global contextual information. \\textit{PointDico} achieves a new state-of-the-art in 3D representation learning, \\textit{e.g.}, \\textbf{94.32\\%} accuracy on ScanObjectNN, \\textbf{86.5\\%} Inst. mIoU on ShapeNetPart.", "AI": {"tldr": "PointDico\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u800c3D\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u5e8f\u70b9\u4e91\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "PointDico\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u53bb\u566a\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff1aScanObjectNN\u4e0a94.32%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cShapeNetPart\u4e0a86.5%\u5b9e\u4f8bmIoU\u3002", "conclusion": "PointDico\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Such dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie or misrepresent its actions.\n  In this work we propose a method for eliciting an honest expression of an LLM's shortcomings via a self-reported *confession*. A confession is an output, provided upon request after a model's original answer, that is meant to serve as a full account of the model's compliance with the letter and spirit of its policies and instructions. The reward assigned to a confession during training is solely based on its honesty, and does not impact positively or negatively the main answer's reward. As long as the \"path of least resistance\" for maximizing confession reward is to surface misbehavior rather than covering it up, this incentivizes models to be honest in their confessions. Our findings provide some justification this empirical assumption, especially in the case of egregious model misbehavior.\n  To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we train GPT-5-Thinking to produce confessions, and we evaluate its honesty in out-of-distribution scenarios measuring hallucination, instruction following, scheming, and reward hacking. We find that when the model lies or omits shortcomings in its \"main\" answer, it often confesses to these behaviors honestly, and this confession honesty modestly improves with training. Confessions can enable a number of inference-time interventions including monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to the user.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\"\u5fcf\u6094\"\u673a\u5236\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bda\u5b9e\u62a5\u544a\u81ea\u8eab\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e3a\u5fcf\u6094\u8bbe\u7f6e\u72ec\u7acb\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bda\u5b9e\u62ab\u9732\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u81ea\u8eab\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8bda\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u5938\u5927\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6216\u63a9\u76d6\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u4e0d\u5f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u8bda\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u81ea\u8eab\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u5fcf\u6094\"\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e3b\u8981\u7b54\u6848\u540e\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fcf\u6094\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u9075\u5b88\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4e3a\u5fcf\u6094\u8bbe\u7f6e\u72ec\u7acb\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fcf\u6094\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u8981\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3GPT-5-Thinking\u4ea7\u751f\u5fcf\u6094\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u8bf4\u8c0e\u6216\u9690\u7792\u7f3a\u9677\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u8bda\u5b9e\u5fcf\u6094\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u5fcf\u6094\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5fcf\u6094\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fcf\u6094\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bda\u5b9e\u62a5\u544a\u81ea\u8eab\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5411\u7528\u6237\u63ed\u793a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e25\u91cd\u8fdd\u89c4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic capabilities and produce \"thin descriptions\", they neglect the importance of multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2) cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset. Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with models producing \"thick descriptions\".

Conventional deep learning-based methods are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to regional heterogeneity within feature representations. Although various adaptive convolution methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often suffer from excessive computational costs and a limited ability to capture heterogeneous regions in remote sensing images effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi^2MAC), which effectively exploits information from different types of regions while intelligently allocating computational resources. Specifically, we design a lightweight module to generate both soft and hard masks, which are used to modulate the input features preliminarily and to guide different types of regions into separate processing branches, respectively.

Model-based value expansion fits an on-policy value function using length-n imaginary rollouts generated by the current policy and a learned dynamics model. While larger n reduces bias in value bootstrapping, it amplifies accumulated model errors over long horizons, degrading future predictions. We address this trade-off with an \\emph{action-chunk} model that predicts a future state from a sequence of actions (an \"action chunk\") instead of a single action, which reduces compounding errors. In addition, instead of directly training a policy to maximize rewards, we employ rejection sampling from an expressive behavioral action-chunk policy, which prevents model exploitation from out-of-distribution actions. We call this recipe \\textbf{Model-Based RL with Action Chunks (MAC)}.

This paper proposes a new Hybrid Splatting(HybridSplat) mechanism for Gaussian primitives. Our key idea is a new reflection-baked Gaussian tracing, which bakes the view-dependent reflection within each Gaussian primitive while rendering the reflection using tile-based Gaussian splatting. Then we integrate the reflective Gaussian primitives with base Gaussian primitives using a unified hybrid splatting framework for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. Moreover, we further introduce a pipeline-level acceleration for the hybrid splatting, and reflection-sensitive Gaussian pruning to reduce the model size, thus achieving much faster rendering speed and lower memory storage while preserving the reflection rendering quality. By extensive evaluation, our HybridSplat accelerates about 7x rendering speed across complex reflective scenes from Ref-NeRF, NeRF-Casting with 4x fewer Gaussian primitives than similar ray-tracing based Gaussian splatting baselines, serving as a new state-of-the-art method especially for complex reflective scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "HybridSplat\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6e85\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u70d8\u7119\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6df7\u5408\u6e85\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53cd\u5c04\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e867\u500d\u6e32\u67d3\u52a0\u901f\u548c4\u500d\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5c04\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u5c04\u6e32\u67d3\u53c8\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6e85\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u53cd\u5c04\u70d8\u7119\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u53cd\u5c04\u70d8\u7119\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u5185\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u74e6\u7247\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u6e32\u67d3\u53cd\u5c04\uff1b3\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u6df7\u5408\u6e85\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u53cd\u5c04\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\uff1b4\uff09\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7ea7\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ref-NeRF\u548cNeRF-Casting\u7684\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5c04\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea67\u500d\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u7c7b\u4f3c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c114\u500d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5c04\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HybridSplat\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6e85\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u5c04\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5c04\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528Youden's J\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6765\u9009\u62e9LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u5982LLM-as-a-judge\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u671f\u671b/\u4e0d\u671f\u671b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u7387\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5982\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001F1\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6b63\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9009\u62e9\u626d\u66f2\u6d41\u884c\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528Youden's J\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u662fJ\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u52bf", "result": "Youden's J\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b49\u6548\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9009\u62e9", "conclusion": "\u5728LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ed3\u679c"}}

Project Page: https://igl-hkust.github.io/TrackingWorld.github.io/", "summary": "Monocular 3D tracking aims to capture the long-term motion of pixels in 3D space from a single monocular video and has witnessed rapid progress in recent years. However, we argue that the existing monocular 3D tracking methods still fall short in separating the camera motion from foreground dynamic motion and cannot densely track newly emerging dynamic subjects in the videos. To address these two limitations, we propose TrackingWorld, a novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric 3D coordinate system. First, we introduce a tracking upsampler that efficiently lifts the arbitrary sparse 2D tracks into dense 2D tracks. Then, to generalize the current tracking methods to newly emerging objects, we apply the upsampler to all frames and reduce the redundancy of 2D tracks by eliminating the tracks in overlapped regions. Finally, we present an efficient optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating the camera poses and the 3D coordinates of these 2D tracks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTrackingWorld\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u5bc6\u96c63D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5206\u79bb\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee3D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff1a1) \u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b2) \u65e0\u6cd5\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5c06\u7a00\u758f2D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c62D\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff1b2) \u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5e27\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5bc6\u96c62D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53cd\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5fc33D\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c3D\u5750\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5bc6\u96c6\u76843D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "TrackingWorld\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee3D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u79bb\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u5bc6\u96c63D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002"}}

However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features. We dub this plug-and-play approach Class Subspace Orthogonalization (CSO) and assess it against challenging mixed-label and adaptive attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCSO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u6291\u5236\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a\u67d0\u4e9b\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u5929\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6781\u7aef\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u95e8\u7279\u5f81\u5fae\u5f31\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u7aef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a1) \u67d0\u4e9b\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u5929\u7136\u5bb9\u6613\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4f1a\u81ea\u7136\u83b7\u5f97\u6781\u7aef\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff1b2) \u540e\u95e8\u7279\u5f81\u5fae\u5f31\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCSO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u6291\u5236\u7c7b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6291\u5236\u4f1a\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff1b\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\uff0c\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u4ecd\u7136\u663e\u8457\u3002", "result": "CSO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6807\u7b7e\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u6291\u5236\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0cCSO\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u524d\u6cbfAI\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u751f\u7269\u6050\u6016\u4e3b\u4e49\u6216\u83b7\u53d6\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u5a01\u80c1\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u80fd\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u8981\u7d20\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1-\u67e5\u8be2\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u65bd\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "conclusion": "BBG\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5bf9\u624b\u3002"}}

However, their reliance on the ubiquitous Pre-Norm architecture introduces a subtle yet critical flaw: a severe norm disparity between the high-norm visual tokens and the low-norm text tokens. In this work, we present a formal theoretical analysis demonstrating that this imbalance is not a static issue. Instead, it induces an ``asymmetric update dynamic,'' where high-norm visual tokens exhibit a ``representational inertia,'' causing them to transform semantically much slower than their textual counterparts. This fundamentally impairs effective cross-modal feature fusion. Our empirical validation across a range of mainstream MLLMs confirms that this theoretical dynamic -- the persistence of norm disparity and the resulting asymmetric update rates -- is a prevalent phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple yet effective solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment. Experiments conducted on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture show that this intervention yields significant performance gains not only on a wide suite of multimodal benchmarks but also, notably, on text-only evaluations such as MMLU, suggesting that resolving the architectural imbalance leads to a more holistically capable model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672ctoken\u7684norm\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0LayerNorm\u5c42\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50norm\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u91c7\u7528Pre-Norm\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9token\u7684\u9ad8norm\u548c\u6587\u672ctoken\u7684\u4f4enorm\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8fd9\u79cdnorm\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u662f\u9759\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\"\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\"\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u9ad8norm\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\"\u8868\u5f81\u60ef\u6027\"\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u901f\u5ea6\u8fdc\u6162\u4e8e\u6587\u672ctoken\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660enorm\u5dee\u5f02\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u540e\u63d2\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684LayerNorm\u5c42\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50norm\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LLaVA-1.5\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u52a8\u6001\uff08norm\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u66f4\u65b0\u7387\uff09\u662f\u4e3b\u6d41MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LayerNorm\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5982MMLU\uff09\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89e3\u51b3\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684norm\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u635f\u5bb3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684LayerNorm\u5c42\u63d2\u5165\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50norm\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u67b6\u6784\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios. In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM.

Although numerous methods have been proposed to enhance image quality, they either significantly amplify inherent noise or are only effective under specific illumination conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions. Firstly, a gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) is employed to accurately estimate illumination and improve image quality. Next, the Retinex model is applied to decompose the captured image into separate illumination and reflection layers. These layers undergo parallel processing, with the illumination layer being corrected to optimize lighting conditions and the reflection layer enhanced to improve image quality. Finally, the dynamic range of the image is optimized through multi-exposure fusion and a linear stretching strategy. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets obtained from practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both contrast enhancement and noise suppression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u57df\u52a0\u6743\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001Retinex\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u66dd\u5149\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5404\u79cd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u663e\u8457\u653e\u5927\u56fa\u6709\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5149\u7167\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u57df\u52a0\u6743\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ee4\u6ce2(GDWGIF)\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5149\u7167\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b2. \u5e94\u7528Retinex\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5149\u7167\u5c42\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u5c42\uff1b3. \u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff1a\u5149\u7167\u5c42\u6821\u6b63\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u53cd\u5c04\u5c42\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u66dd\u5149\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u62c9\u4f38\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce \\textbf{TreeGRPO}, a novel RL framework that dramatically improves training efficiency by recasting the denoising process as a search tree. From shared initial noise samples, TreeGRPO strategically branches to generate multiple candidate trajectories while efficiently reusing their common prefixes. This tree-structured approach delivers three key advantages: (1) \\emph{High sample efficiency}, achieving better performance under same training samples (2) \\emph{Fine-grained credit assignment} via reward backpropagation that computes step-specific advantages, overcoming the uniform credit assignment limitation of trajectory-based methods, and (3) \\emph{Amortized computation} where multi-child branching enables multiple policy updates per forward pass. Extensive experiments on both diffusion and flow-based models demonstrate that TreeGRPO achieves \\textbf{2.4$\\times$ faster training} while establishing a superior Pareto frontier in the efficiency-reward trade-off space.

With the recent adoption of Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems, more video data is now being collected than can be feasibly reviewed manually. This paper addresses this challenge by developing an optimized deep learning pipeline for automated fish re-identification (Re-ID) using the novel AutoFish dataset, which simulates EM systems with conveyor belts with six similarly looking fish species. We demonstrate that key Re-ID metrics (R1 and mAP@k) are substantially improved by using hard triplet mining in conjunction with a custom image transformation pipeline that includes dataset-specific normalization. By employing these strategies, we demonstrate that the Vision Transformer-based Swin-T architecture consistently outperforms the Convolutional Neural Network-based ResNet-50, achieving peak performance of 41.65% mAP@k and 90.43% Rank-1 accuracy. An in-depth analysis reveals that the primary challenge is distinguishing visually similar individuals of the same species (Intra-species errors), where viewpoint inconsistency proves significantly more detrimental than partial occlusion.

However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LayerPipe2 \u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u5bfc\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u914d\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7ba1\u9053\u611f\u77e5\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e4b\u524d\u7684 LayerPipe \u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u53e0\u524d\u5411\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u68af\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u91cd\u5b9a\u65f6\u6280\u672f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u5bfc LayerPipe\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5408\u6cd5\u63d2\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7ba1\u9053\u611f\u77e5\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u6765\u91cd\u6784\u5386\u53f2\u6743\u91cd\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u975e\u663e\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\u76f4\u63a5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u5185\u5c42\u9700\u8981\u8f83\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u9700\u8981\u8f83\u957f\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b\u5f53\u6bcf\u5c42\u90fd\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u5206\u7ec4\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65f6\uff0c\u7ec4\u5185\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "LayerPipe2 \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6307\u5bfc LayerPipe \u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u5b58\u50a8\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u901a\u4fe1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u8861\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

While recent image-based HMR methods such as SAM 3D Body achieve strong robustness on in-the-wild images, they rely on per-frame inference when applied to videos, leading to temporal inconsistency and degraded performance under occlusions. We address these issues without extra training by leveraging the inherent human continuity in videos. We propose SAM-Body4D, a training-free framework for temporally consistent and occlusion-robust HMR from videos. We first generate identity-consistent masklets using a promptable video segmentation model, then refine them with an Occlusion-Aware module to recover missing regions. The refined masklets guide SAM 3D Body to produce consistent full-body mesh trajectories, while a padding-based parallel strategy enables efficient multi-human inference. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM-Body4D achieves improved temporal stability and robustness in challenging in-the-wild videos, without any retraining.

As high-quality public data for large language models (LLMs) approaches exhaustion, on-device fine-tuning provides an opportunity to leverage private user data while preserving privacy. However, existing approaches are predominantly simulation-based or rely on IoT devices and PCs, leaving commodity mobile phones largely unexplored. A key gap is the absence of an open-source framework that enables practical LLM fine-tuning on mobile phones. We present MobileFineTuner, a unified open-source framework that enables end-to-end LLM fine-tuning directly on commodity mobile phones. MobileFineTuner is designed for efficiency, scalability, and usability, supporting full-parameters fine-tuning (Full-FT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). To address the memory and energy limitations inherent to mobile phones, we introduce system-level optimizations including parameter sharding, gradient accumulation, and energy-aware computation scheduling. We demonstrate the practicality of MobileFineTuner by fine-tuning GPT-2, Gemma 3, and Qwen 2.5 on real mobile phones. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations and establish MobileFineTuner as a viable foundation for future research on on-device LLM training.", "AI": {"tldr": "MobileFineTuner\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u666e\u901a\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u7247\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u7d2f\u79ef\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u63a5\u8fd1\u67af\u7aed\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79c1\u6709\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56IoT/PC\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u624b\u673a\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMobileFineTuner\u7edf\u4e00\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u7247\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u5fae\u8c03GPT-2\u3001Gemma 3\u548cQwen 2.5\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eMobileFineTuner\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "MobileFineTuner\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u624b\u673a\u7aefLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient paradigm to remedy this shortcoming, termed One-shot video-Clip based Retrieval AuGmentation (OneClip-RAG). Compared with existing video RAG methods, OneClip-RAG makes full use of the merits of video clips for augmented video understanding in terms of both knowledge integrity and semantic coherence. Besides, it is also equipped with a novel query-guided video chunking algorithm that can unify clip chunking and cross-modal retrieval in one processing step, avoiding redundant computations. To improve instruction following, we further propose a new dataset called SynLongVideo and design a progressive training regime for OneClip-RAG. OneClip-RAG is plugged into five recent MLLMs and validated on a set of long-video benchmarks. Experimental results not only show the obvious performance gains by OneClip-RAG over MLLMs, e.g., boosting InternLV2 8B and Qwen2-VL 7B to the level of GPT-4o on MLVU, but also show its superior efficiency in handling long videos. e.g., enabling LLaVA-Video understand up to an hour of videos in less than 2.2 minutes on a single 4090 GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "OneClip-RAG\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u955c\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u5e27\u6570\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOneClip-RAG\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\u7406\u89e3\uff1b2\uff09\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u5757\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b3\uff09\u521b\u5efaSynLongVideo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cOneClip-RAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u5c06InternLV2 8B\u548cQwen2-VL 7B\u63d0\u5347\u5230GPT-4o\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u6781\u9ad8\uff08\u5355\u5f204090 GPU\u4e0a2.2\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5904\u74061\u5c0f\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "OneClip-RAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u8303\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Some researchers have recently challenged such assumption and argued that decoupled weight decay should be set $\\propto \u03b3^2$ instead based on orthogonality arguments at steady state. To the contrary, we find that eliminating the contribution of the perpendicular component of the update to the weight norm leads to little change to the training dynamics. Instead, we derive that decoupled weight decay $\\propto \u03b3^2$ results in stable weight norm based on the simple assumption that updates become independent of the weights at steady state, regardless of the nature of the optimizer. Based on the same assumption, we derive and empirically verify that the Total Update Contribution (TUC) of a minibatch under the Scion optimizer is better characterized by the momentum-dependent effective learning rate whose optimal value transfers and we show that decoupled weight decay $\\propto \u03b3^2$ leads to stable weight and gradient norms and allows us to better control the training dynamics and improve the model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86AdamW\u4e2d\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03b3\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e94\u4e0e\u03b3\u00b2\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a33\u6001\u65f6\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAdamW\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\uff08decoupled weight decay\uff09\u4e00\u76f4\u88ab\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03b3\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u4e0e\u03b3\u00b2\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u63a2\u8ba8\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u8bbe\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d88\u9664\u66f4\u65b0\u5782\u76f4\u5206\u91cf\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\"\u7a33\u6001\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u65e0\u5173\"\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e94\u4e0e\u03b3\u00b2\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u624d\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u6700\u540e\u5728Scion\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5bf9\u603b\u66f4\u65b0\u8d21\u732e\uff08TUC\uff09\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u03b3\u00b2\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u03b3\u00b2\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff1b3\uff09\u5728Scion\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u603b\u66f4\u65b0\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff1b4\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u221d\u03b3\u00b2\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edfAdamW\u4e2d\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03b3\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e94\u4e0e\u03b3\u00b2\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a33\u6001\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u3001\u6539\u5584\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Preprint version", "summary": "Accurately recovering 6D poses in densely packed industrial bin-picking environments remain a serious challenge, owing to occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts. We introduce a holistic depth-only 6D pose estimation approach that fuses multi-view depth maps into either a fine-grained 3D point cloud in its vanilla version, or a sparse Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). At the core of our framework lies a staged heatmap mechanism that yields scene-adaptive attention priors across different resolutions, steering computation toward foreground regions, thus keeping memory requirements at high resolutions feasible. Along, we propose a density-aware sparse transformer block that dynamically attends to (self-) occlusions and the non-uniform distribution of 3D data. While sparse 3D approaches has proven effective for long-range perception, its potential in close-range robotic applications remains underexplored. Our framework operates fully sparse, enabling high-resolution volumetric representations to capture fine geometric details crucial for accurate pose estimation in clutter. Our method processes the entire scene integrally, predicting the 6D pose via a novel per-voxel voting strategy, allowing simultaneous pose predictions for an arbitrary number of target objects. We validate our method on the recently published IPD and MV-YCB multi-view datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in heavily cluttered industrial and household bin picking scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u70b9\u4e91\u6216\u7a00\u758fTSDF\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u70ed\u56fe\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758fTransformer\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u5de5\u4e1a\u6293\u53d6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u6293\u53d6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u906e\u6321\u3001\u53cd\u5149\u548c\u65e0\u7eb9\u7406\u90e8\u4ef6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u70b9\u4e91\u6216\u7a00\u758fTSDF\uff1b2. \u5206\u5c42\u70ed\u56fe\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u573a\u666f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b3. \u5bc6\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758fTransformer\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u548c\u975e\u5747\u53003D\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff1b4. \u5b8c\u5168\u7a00\u758f\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\uff1b5. \u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u7d20\u7684\u6295\u7968\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u4f53\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728IPD\u548cMV-YCB\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5ea6\u6742\u4e71\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u6293\u53d6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bc6\u96c6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f536D\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u6293\u53d6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent works find that non\\-Euclidean pseudo\\-Riemannian manifolds provide specific inductive biases for embedding graph data, but how to leverage them to improve CapsNets is still underexplored. Here, we extend the Euclidean capsule routing into geodesically disconnected pseudo\\-Riemannian manifolds and derive a Pseudo\\-Riemannian Capsule Network (PR\\-CapsNet), which models data in pseudo\\-Riemannian manifolds of adaptive curvature, for graph representation learning. Specifically, PR\\-CapsNet enhances the CapsNet with Adaptive Pseudo\\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing by utilizing pseudo\\-Riemannian geometry. Unlike single\\-curvature or subspace\\-partitioning methods, PR\\-CapsNet concurrently models hierarchical and cluster or cyclic graph structures via its versatile pseudo\\-Riemannian metric. It first deploys Pseudo\\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing to decompose capsule states into spherical\\-temporal and Euclidean\\-spatial subspaces with diffeomorphic transformations. Then, an Adaptive Curvature Routing is developed to adaptively fuse features from different curvature spaces for complex graphs via a learnable curvature tensor with geometric attention from local manifold properties.

Existing approaches typically fine-tune natural foundation models (e.g., SAM) with limited supervision, functioning merely as domain adapters rather than surgical foundation models. Consequently, they struggle to generalize across the vast variability of surgical targets. To bridge this gap, we present LapFM, a foundation model designed to evolve robust segmentation capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images. Distinct from medical foundation models relying on inefficient self-supervised proxy tasks, LapFM leverages a Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training paradigm. First, we establish a Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) via a hierarchical mask decoder with parent-child query embeddings, unifying diverse entities (i.e., Anatomy, Tissue, and Instrument) into a scalable knowledge structure with cross-granularity semantic consistency. Second, we propose a Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images into training. This process yields LapBench-114K, a large-scale benchmark comprising 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

By capturing richer spectral information than conventional RGB sensors, these systems can enhance key imaging tasks, including color correction. However, most existing methods treat the color correction pipeline in separate stages, often discarding MS data early in the process. We propose a unified, learning-based framework that (i) performs end-to-end color correction and (ii) jointly leverages data from a high-resolution RGB sensor and an auxiliary low-resolution MS sensor. Our approach integrates the full pipeline within a single model, producing coherent and color-accurate outputs. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our framework by refactoring two different state-of-the-art image-to-image architectures.

While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings. These findings highlight limitations of current subset-based approaches and demonstrate how uncertainty-driven optimization can enhance attribution and object-level interpretability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI in real-world vision applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5b50\u6a21\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u654f\u611f\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b50\u6a21\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u5b50\u6a21\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684AI\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def"}}

Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in solving differential equations, and their quantum counterparts, quantum-PINNs, exhibit enhanced representational capacity with fewer trainable parameters. However, both approaches face notable challenges in accurately solving multiscale features. Furthermore, their reliance on automatic differentiation for constructing loss functions introduces considerable computational overhead, resulting in longer training times. To overcome these challenges, we developed a wavelet-accelerated physics-informed quantum neural network that eliminates the need for automatic differentiation, significantly reducing computational complexity. The proposed framework incorporates the multiresolution property of wavelets within the quantum neural network architecture, thereby enhancing the network's ability to effectively capture both local and global features of multiscale problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior accuracy while requiring less than five percent of the trainable parameters compared to classical wavelet-based PINNs, resulting in faster convergence. Moreover, it offers a speedup of three to five times compared to existing quantum PINNs, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach for efficiently solving challenging multiscale and oscillatory problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5177\u6709\u5c16\u9510\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u521a\u5ea6\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u632f\u8361\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(PINNs)\u53ca\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u7248\u672c(\u91cf\u5b50PINNs)\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u6784\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c0f\u6ce2\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u6027\u878d\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u6349\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u5c0f\u6ce2PINNs\u4ec5\u9700\u4e0d\u52305%\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50PINNs\u63d0\u4f9b3-5\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u6311\u6218\u6027\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5177\u6709\u5c16\u9510\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u521a\u5ea6\u548c\u632f\u8361\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u6311\u6218\u6027\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper presents a lightweight SAM-based tracking method combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with CSRT trackers and jersey color-based appearance models. We propose a team-aware tracking system that uses SAM for precise initialization and HSV histogram-based re-identification to improve occlusion recovery. Our evaluation measures three dimensions: processing speed (FPS and memory), tracking accuracy (success rate and box stability), and robustness (occlusion recovery and identity consistency). Experiments on football video sequences show that the approach achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory usage (~1880 MB), maintaining 100 percent tracking success in light occlusions and 90 percent in crowded penalty-box scenarios with 5 or more players. Appearance-based re-identification recovers 50 percent of heavy occlusions, demonstrating the value of domain-specific cues. Analysis reveals key trade-offs: the SAM + CSRT combination provides consistent performance across crowd densities but struggles with long-term occlusions where players leave the frame, achieving only 8.66 percent re-acquisition success. These results offer practical guidelines for deploying football tracking systems under resource constraints, showing that classical tracker-based methods work well with continuous visibility but require stronger re-identification mechanisms for extended absences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SAM-based\u8db3\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SAM\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u3001CSRT\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7403\u8863\u989c\u8272\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8db3\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9762\u4e34\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u3001\u5916\u89c2\u76f8\u4f3c\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e2\u961f\u611f\u77e5\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528SAM\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408CSRT\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8eHSV\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u7684\u7403\u8863\u989c\u8272\u5916\u89c2\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u906e\u6321\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8db3\u7403\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52307.6-7.7 FPS\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u7a33\u5b9a(~1880 MB)\u3002\u8f7b\u5ea6\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301100%\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u62e5\u6324\u7981\u533a\u573a\u666f(5+\u7403\u5458)\u4e0b90%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u5916\u89c2\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u6062\u590d50%\u7684\u91cd\u5ea6\u906e\u6321\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM+CSRT\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u79bb\u5e27\u906e\u6321\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ec58.66%\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7f3a\u5e2d\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8db3\u7403\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

Despite existing methods having made notable progress, they still fail to fully exploit the contextual information in the reference image, including fine-grained texture details, leading to edits with limited coherence and fidelity. To address this challenge, we introduce ContextDrag, a new paradigm for drag-based editing that leverages the strong contextual modeling capability of editing models, such as FLUX-Kontext. By incorporating VAE-encoded features from the reference image, ContextDrag can leverage rich contextual cues and preserve fine-grained details, without the need for finetuning or inversion. Specifically, ContextDrag introduced a novel Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features into their correct destination locations via a Latent-space Reverse Mapping (LRM) algorithm. This strategy enables precise drag control while preserving consistency in both semantics and texture details.

Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

A common approach to leverage this data is to train a graph neural network (GNN) on the KG. However, existing message-passing GNNs struggle to scale to large KGs because they rely on the iterative message passing process to learn the graph structure, which is inefficient, especially under mini-batch training, where a node sees only a partial view of its neighborhood. In this paper, we address this problem and present gHAWK, a novel and scalable GNN training framework for large KGs. The key idea is to precompute structural features for each node that capture its local and global structure before GNN training even begins. Specifically, gHAWK introduces a preprocessing step that computes: (a)~Bloom filters to compactly encode local neighborhood structure, and (b)~TransE embeddings to represent each node's global position in the graph. These features are then fused with any domain-specific features (e.g., text embeddings), producing a node feature vector that can be incorporated into any GNN technique. By augmenting message-passing training with structural priors, gHAWK significantly reduces memory usage, accelerates convergence, and improves model accuracy. Extensive experiments on large datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) demonstrate that gHAWK achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and lower training time on both node property prediction and link prediction tasks, topping the OGB leaderboard for three graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "gHAWK\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u53ea\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u90e8\u5206\u90bb\u5c45\u89c6\u56fe", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528Bloom\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u7d27\u51d1\u7f16\u7801\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528TransE\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u878d\u5165\u4efb\u4f55GNN\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf", "result": "\u5728Open Graph Benchmark\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cgHAWK\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u4f4d\u5c45OGB\u6392\u884c\u699c\u9996\u4f4d", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0cgHAWK\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

While on-the-fly extensions of 3DGS have shown promise for real-time reconstruction from monocular RGB streams, they often fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to the limited field of view (FOV). Employing a multi-camera rig fundamentally addresses this limitation. In this paper, we present the first on-the-fly 3D reconstruction framework for multi-camera rigs. Our method incrementally fuses dense RGB streams from multiple overlapping cameras into a unified Gaussian representation, achieving drift-free trajectory estimation and efficient online reconstruction. We propose a hierarchical camera initialization scheme that enables coarse inter-camera alignment without calibration, followed by a lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment that stabilizes trajectories while maintaining real-time performance. Furthermore, we introduce a redundancy-free Gaussian sampling strategy and a frequency-aware optimization scheduler to reduce the number of Gaussian primitives and the required optimization iterations, thereby maintaining both efficiency and reconstruction fidelity.

Oblique forests address this with per-node hyperplane splits, but at added computational cost and implementation complexity. We propose a simple alternative: JARF, Jacobian-Aligned Random Forests. Concretely, we first fit an axis-aligned forest to estimate class probabilities or regression outputs, compute finite-difference gradients of these predictions with respect to each feature, aggregate them into an expected Jacobian outer product that generalizes the expected gradient outer product (EGOP), and use it as a single global linear preconditioner for all inputs. This supervised preconditioner applies a single global rotation of the feature space, then hands the transformed data back to a standard axis-aligned forest, preserving off-the-shelf training pipelines while capturing oblique boundaries and feature interactions that would otherwise require many axis-aligned splits to approximate. The same construction applies to any model that provides gradients, though we focus on random forests and gradient-boosted trees in this work. On tabular classification and regression benchmarks, this preconditioning consistently improves axis-aligned forests and often matches or surpasses oblique baselines while improving training time.

We introduce \\textbf{ReasonBreak}, a novel adversarial framework specifically designed to disrupt hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through concept-aware perturbations. Our approach is founded on the key insight that effective disruption of geographic reasoning requires perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies rather than uniform noise. ReasonBreak strategically targets critical conceptual dependencies within reasoning chains, generating perturbations that invalidate specific inference steps and cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. To facilitate this approach, we contribute \\textbf{GeoPrivacy-6K}, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images ($\\geq$2K) with hierarchical concept annotations.

It has been observed in recent works that learning in a federated manner may lead the aggregated global model to converge to a 'sharp minimum' thereby adversely affecting the generalizability of this FL-trained model. Therefore, in this work, we aim to improve the generalization performance of models trained in a federated setup by introducing a 'flatness' constrained FL optimization problem. This flatness constraint is imposed on the top eigenvalue of the Hessian computed from the training loss. As each client trains a model on its local data, we further re-formulate this complex problem utilizing the client loss functions and propose a new computationally efficient regularization technique, dubbed 'MAN,' which Minimizes Activation's Norm of each layer on client-side models. We also theoretically show that minimizing the activation norm reduces the top eigenvalue of the layer-wise Hessian of the client's loss, which in turn decreases the overall Hessian's top eigenvalue, ensuring convergence to a flat minimum.

Despite the success of this architecture, misalignment and hallucinations remain common issues and require automatic misalignment detection tools to improve quality, for example by applying them in a Best-of-N (BoN) post-generation setting. Unfortunately, measuring the alignment after the generation is an expensive step since we need to wait for the overall generation to finish to determine prompt adherence. In contrast, this work hypothesizes that text/image misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process, enabling real-time alignment assessment without waiting for the complete generation. In particular, we propose NoisyCLIP a method that measures semantic alignment in the noisy latent space. This work is the first to explore and benchmark prompt-to-latent misalignment detection during image generation using dual encoders in the reverse diffusion process. We evaluate NoisyCLIP qualitatively and quantitatively and find it reduces computational cost by 50% while achieving 98% of CLIP alignment performance in BoN settings.

If the labels are not mutually exclusive, and if the labels vary greatly in frequency, obtaining a sample that includes sufficient observations with scarcer labels to make inferences about those labels, and which deviates from the population frequencies in a known manner, creates challenges. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bernoulli distribution as our underlying distribution of a multi-label problem. We present a novel sampling algorithm that takes label dependencies into account. It uses observed label frequencies to estimate multivariate Bernoulli distribution parameters and calculate weights for each label combination. This approach ensures the weighted sampling acquires target distribution characteristics while accounting for label dependencies. We applied this approach to a sample of research articles from Web of Science labeled with 64 biomedical topic categories. We aimed to preserve category frequency order, reduce frequency differences between most and least common categories, and account for category dependencies.

Our OCCDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to generate continuous occupancy functions evaluable at arbitrary locations. Moreover, a point encoder is proposed to provide condition features to diffusion learning, constraint the final occupancy prediction for occupancy decoder, and insert multi-modal features for latent generation to latent encoder. To further enhance the model performance, a multi-task training strategy is employed, ensuring that the point encoder learns diverse and robust feature representations.

While certified unlearning has been analyzed in centralized and server-orchestrated federated settings (via guarantees analogous to differential privacy, DP), the decentralized setting -- where peers communicate without a coordinator remains underexplored. We study certified unlearning in decentralized networks with fixed topologies and propose RR-DU, a random-walk procedure that performs one projected gradient ascent step on the forget set at the unlearning client and a geometrically distributed number of projected descent steps on the retained data elsewhere, combined with subsampled Gaussian noise and projection onto a trust region around the original model. We provide (i) convergence guarantees in the convex case and stationarity guarantees in the nonconvex case, (ii) $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$ network-unlearning certificates on client views via subsampled Gaussian R\u00e9nyi DP (RDP) with segment-level subsampling, and (iii) deletion-capacity bounds that scale with the forget-to-local data ratio and quantify the effect of decentralization (network mixing and randomized subsampling) on the privacy-utility trade-off. Empirically, on image benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10), RR-DU matches a given $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$ while achieving higher test accuracy than decentralized DP baselines and reducing forget accuracy to random guessing ($\\approx 10\\%$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRR-DU\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6dfb\u52a0\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u5bb9\u91cf\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u8bf7\u6c42\u6216\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u5df2\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u65e0\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u7684\u5bf9\u7b49\u901a\u4fe1\uff09\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRR-DU\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u56fa\u5b9a\u62d3\u6251\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u9057\u5fd8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u5e03\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u4e0b\u964d\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u6295\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\uff1a(1)\u51f8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b(2)\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u9ad8\u65afR\u00e9nyi\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f51\u7edc\u9057\u5fd8\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff1b(3)\u9057\u5fd8\u5bb9\u91cf\u754c\u9650\u3002\u5728MNIST\u548cCIFAR-10\u4e0a\uff0cRR-DU\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6bd4\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u57fa\u7ebf\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u81f3\u968f\u673a\u731c\u6d4b\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u7ea610%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RR-DU\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u8bc1\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, optimizing interleaved multimodal CoT (iMCoT) through reinforcement learning remains challenging, as it relies on scarce high-quality reasoning data. In this study, we propose Self-Calling Chain-of-Thought (sCoT), a novel visual reasoning paradigm that reformulates iMCoT as a language-only CoT with self-calling. Specifically, a main agent decomposes the complex visual reasoning task to atomic subtasks and invokes its virtual replicas, i.e. parameter-sharing subagents, to solve them in isolated context. sCoT enjoys substantial training effectiveness and efficiency, as it requires no explicit interleaving between modalities. sCoT employs group-relative policy optimization to reinforce effective reasoning behavior to enhance optimization. Experiments on HR-Bench 4K show that sCoT improves the overall reasoning performance by up to $1.9\\%$ with $\\sim 75\\%$ fewer GPU hours compared to strong baseline approaches.

This paper, the second in a series of three, describes the second component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) framework: the generation of the Bacterial Biothreat Benchmark (B3) dataset. The development process involved three complementary approaches: 1) web-based prompt generation, 2) red teaming, and 3) mining existing benchmark corpora, to generate over 7,000 potential benchmarks linked to the Task-Query Architecture that was developed during the first component of the project. A process of de-duplication, followed by an assessment of uplift diagnosticity, and general quality control measures, reduced the candidates to a set of 1,010 final benchmarks.

We introduce a progressive reparameterization strategy that compresses these models by gradually replacing dense feed-forward network blocks with compact Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers. A residual interpolation schedule, together with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses, ensures that the PHM modules inherit the functional behavior of their dense counterparts during training. This transition yields substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving strong multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality.

However, we observe that existing grounding models exhibit significant coordinate prediction instability, minor visual perturbations (e.g. cropping a few pixels) can drastically alter predictions, flipping results between correct and incorrect. This instability severely undermines model performance, especially for samples with high-resolution and small UI elements. To address this issue, we propose Multi-View Prediction (MVP), a training-free framework that enhances grounding performance through multi-view inference. Our key insight is that while single-view predictions may be unstable, aggregating predictions from multiple carefully cropped views can effectively distinguish correct coordinates from outliers. MVP comprises two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal, which derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering, which ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate MVP's effectiveness across various models and benchmarks. Notably, on ScreenSpot-Pro, MVP boosts UI-TARS-1.5-7B to 56.1%, GTA1-7B to 61.7%, Qwen3VL-8B-Instruct to 65.3%, and Qwen3VL-32B-Instruct to 74.0%.

Existing generation and editing techniques are often constrained by the distribution of training data and primarily focus on modifying real photographs. In this work, we introduce a unified multimodal framework for oil painting generation and editing. The proposed system allows users to incorporate reference images for precise semantic control, hand-drawn sketches for spatial structure alignment, and natural language prompts for high-level semantic guidance, while consistently maintaining a unified painting style across all outputs. Our method achieves interactive oil painting creation through three crucial technical advancements. First, we enhance the training stage with spatial alignment and semantic enhancement conditioning strategy, which map masks and sketches into spatial constraints, and encode contextual embedding from reference images and text into feature constraints, enabling object-level semantic alignment. Second, to overcome data scarcity, we propose a self-supervised style transfer pipeline based on Stroke-Based Rendering (SBR), which simulates the inpainting dynamics of oil painting restoration, converting real images into stylized oil paintings with preserved brushstroke textures to construct a large-scale paired training dataset. Finally, during inference, we integrate features using the AdaIN operator to ensure stylistic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our interactive system enables fine-grained editing while preserving the artistic qualities of oil paintings, achieving an unprecedented level of imagination realization in stylized oil paintings generation and editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6cb9\u753b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u624b\u7ed8\u8349\u56fe\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8bed\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6cb9\u753b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u878d\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u62bd\u8c61\u601d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u827a\u672f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u5176\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7b14\u89e6\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u7279\u6027\u7ed9\u6570\u5b57\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4fee\u6539\u771f\u5b9e\u7167\u7247\u3002", "method": "1) \u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u8349\u56fe\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u89e6\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6cb9\u753b\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u7b14\u89e6\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u6cb9\u753b\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u914d\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3) \u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528AdaIN\u7b97\u5b50\u96c6\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6cb9\u753b\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u8d28\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6cb9\u753b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6cb9\u753b\u521b\u4f5c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6cb9\u753b\u6570\u5b57\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

A key obstacle lies in the lack of diverse and high-quality real-world 3D assets with rich texture details, since capturing such data is intrinsically difficult due to the diverse scales of scenes, non-rigid motions of objects, and the limited precision of 3D scanners. We introduce Photo3D, a framework for advancing photorealistic 3D generation, which is driven by the image data generated by the GPT-4o-Image model. Considering that the generated images can distort 3D structures due to their lack of multi-view consistency, we design a structure-aligned multi-view synthesis pipeline and construct a detail-enhanced multi-view dataset paired with 3D geometry. Building on it, we present a realistic detail enhancement scheme that leverages perceptual feature adaptation and semantic structure matching to enforce appearance consistency with realistic details while preserving the structural consistency with the 3D-native geometry. Our scheme is general to different 3D-native generators, and we present dedicated training strategies to facilitate the optimization of geometry-texture coupled and decoupled 3D-native generation paradigms.

Existing attack strategies typically rely on locally uniform perturbations, which treat all samples indiscriminately. This approach is inefficient, as it wastes the perturbation budget on low-impact samples, and lacks stealthiness due to significant statistical deviations. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7TD\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u914d\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u5747\u5300\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u52a0\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u853d\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTD\u8bef\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5728\u5168\u5c40L2\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6270\u52a8\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e0eTD\u8bef\u5dee\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe80%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9003\u907f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u9632\u5fa1\u68c0\u6d4b", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5747\u5300\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u9690\u853d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027"}}

In this work, we tackle this bottleneck and propose a unified AR-diffusion framework Fast-ARDiff that jointly optimizes both components, accelerating AR speculative decoding while simultaneously facilitating faster diffusion decoding. Specifically: (1) The entropy-informed speculative strategy encourages draft model to produce higher-entropy representations aligned with target model's entropy characteristics, mitigating entropy mismatch and high rejection rates caused by draft overconfidence. (2) For diffusion decoding, rather than treating it as an independent module, we integrate it into the same end-to-end framework using a dynamic scheduler that prioritizes AR optimization to guide the diffusion part in further steps. The diffusion part is optimized through a joint distillation framework combining trajectory and distribution matching, ensuring stable training and high-quality synthesis with extremely few steps. During inference, shallow feature entropy from AR module is used to pre-filter low-entropy drafts, avoiding redundant computation and improving latency. Fast-ARDiff achieves state-of-the-art acceleration across diverse models: on ImageNet 256$\\times$256, TransDiff attains 4.3$\\times$ lossless speedup, and NextStep-1 achieves 3$\\times$ acceleration on text-conditioned generation.

Many existing uncertainty methods lack confidence calibration, are costly to run, are not distance-aware, and fail to generalize under out-of-distribution data. We introduce two distance-aware uncertainty methods for deterministic physics-guided neural networks: PG-SNGP, based on Spectral Normalization Gaussian Process, and PG-SNER, based on Deep Evidential Regression. We apply spectral normalization to the hidden layers so the network preserves distances from input to latent space. PG-SNGP replaces the final dense layer with a Gaussian Process layer for distance-sensitive uncertainty, while PG-SNER outputs Normal Inverse Gamma parameters to model uncertainty in a coherent probabilistic form. We assess performance using standard accuracy metrics and a new distance-aware metric based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which measures how well predicted uncertainty tracks the distance between test and training samples. We also design a dynamic weighting scheme in the loss to balance data fidelity and physical consistency. We test our methods on rolling-element bearing degradation using the PRONOSTIA dataset and compare them with Monte Carlo and Deep Ensemble PGNNs.

Traditional models rely mainly on historical prices, but recent work shows that financial news can provide useful external signals. This paper investigates a multimodal approach that integrates companies' news articles with their historical stock data to improve prediction performance. We compare a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with a baseline LSTM model. Historical data for each company is encoded using an LSTM, while news titles are embedded with a language model. These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label. Experiments on the US equities and Bloomberg datasets show that the GNN outperforms the LSTM baseline, achieving 53% accuracy on the first target and a 4% precision gain on the second. Results also indicate that companies with more associated news yield higher prediction accuracy. Moreover, headlines contain stronger predictive signals than full articles, suggesting that concise news summaries play an important role in short-term market reactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u516c\u53f8\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u7ae0\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u80a1\u7968\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(GNN)\u8fdb\u884c\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfLSTM\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u4ef7\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u91d1\u878d\u65b0\u95fb\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u7ae0\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(GNN)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u516c\u53f8\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7528LSTM\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6587\u7ae0\u3001\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GraphSAGE\u6355\u6349\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86GNN\u4e0eLSTM\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u4e8c\u5143\u65b9\u5411\u53d8\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728US equities\u548cBloomberg\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cGNN\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8eLSTM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523053%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f974%\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u76f8\u5173\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\u6bd4\u5b8c\u6574\u6587\u7ae0\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u6458\u8981\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u5e02\u573a\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The key component of diffusion inversion is to minimize errors at each inversion step, thereby mitigating cumulative inaccuracies. Recently, fixed-point iteration has emerged as a widely adopted approach to minimize reconstruction errors at each inversion step. However, it suffers from high computational costs due to its iterative nature and the complexity of hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we propose an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion. First, we derive an explicit expression of the fixed point from an ideal inversion step. Unfortunately, it inherently contains an unknown data prediction error. Building upon this, we introduce the error approximation, which uses the calculable error from the previous inversion step to approximate the unknown error at the current inversion step. This yields a calculable, approximate expression for the fixed point, which is an unbiased estimator characterized by low variance, as shown by our theoretical analysis. We evaluate reconstruction performance on two text-image datasets, NOCAPS and MS-COCO. Compared to DDIM inversion and other inversion methods based on the fixed-point iteration, our method achieves consistent and superior performance in reconstruction tasks without additional iterations or training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u53cd\u6f14\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u53cd\u6f14\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u8fed\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63a8\u5bfc\u7406\u60f3\u53cd\u6f14\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u8bef\u5dee\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u4e00\u6b65\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f53\u524d\u6b65\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f", "result": "\u5728NOCAPS\u548cMS-COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4DDIM\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8fed\u4ee3\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u8fed\u4ee3\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u662f\u6269\u6563\u53cd\u6f14\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u70b9"}}

However, many existing prediction models struggle with concept drift, limited temporal context, and instability across seasons. To advance forecasting in this domain, we introduce a newly constructed longitudinal NBA dataset covering the 2004-05 to 2024-25 seasons and present a deep learning framework designed to model long-term performance trends. Our primary contribution is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that leverages an extended sequence length of 9,840 games equivalent to eight full NBA seasons to capture evolving team dynamics and season-over-season dependencies. We compare this model against several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) baselines, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM achieves the best performance across all metrics, with 72.35 accuracy, 73.15 precision and 76.13 AUC-ROC.

We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSSCATeR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LiDAR\u8fde\u7eed\u626b\u63cf\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u7ed3\u679c\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u53ea\u5904\u7406\u70b9\u4e91\u53d8\u5316\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u51cf\u5c116.61\u500d\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLiDAR\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u6574\u4e2a\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3002\u5229\u7528LiDAR\u8fde\u7eed\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ea\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u5316\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u77ed\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u5377\u79ef\u7ed3\u679c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u590d\u7528\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8e\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSSCATeR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\uff0c\u53ea\u5904\u7406\u70b9\u4e91\u53d8\u5316\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c116.61\u500d\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7a00\u758f\u5377\u79ef\u6280\u672f\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SSCATeR\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u56de\u6536\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347LiDAR\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Part qualification aims at verifying that an additively manufactured part meets performance requirements; therefore, predicting the complex stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured parts is critical. We develop a dynamic time warping (DTW)-transfer learning (TL) framework for additive manufacturing part qualification by transferring knowledge of the stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured low-cost polymers to metals. Specifically, the framework employs DTW to select a polymer dataset as the source domain that is the most relevant to the target metal dataset. Using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, four source polymers (i.e., Nylon, PLA, CF-ABS, and Resin) and three target metals (i.e., AlSi10Mg, Ti6Al4V, and carbon steel) that are fabricated by different AM techniques are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTW-TL framework. Experimental results show that the DTW-TL framework identifies the closest match between polymers and metals to select one single polymer dataset as the source domain. The DTW-TL model achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error of 12.41% and highest coefficient of determination of 0.96 when three metals are used as the target domain, respectively, outperforming the vanilla LSTM model without TL as well as the TL model pre-trained on four polymer datasets as the source domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u96f6\u4ef6\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7684\u5e94\u529b-\u5e94\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u91d1\u5c5e\u6750\u6599", "motivation": "\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u96f6\u4ef6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u5e94\u529b-\u5e94\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u91d1\u5c5e\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u91d1\u5c5e\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6210\u672c", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u91d1\u5c5e\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6e90\u57df\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56db\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u7269\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u91d1\u5c5e\u6750\u6599", "result": "DTW-TL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u805a\u5408\u7269\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5355\u4e00\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6e90\u57df\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56db\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0cDTW-TL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f4e12.41%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6700\u9ad80.96\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u7cfb\u6570", "conclusion": "DTW-TL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u91d1\u5c5e\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5e94\u529b-\u5e94\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u96f6\u4ef6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Unlike prior neural ISP designs, our method introduces a high degree of modularity, providing full control over multiple intermediate stages of the rendering process.~This modular design not only achieves high rendering accuracy but also improves scalability, debuggability, generalization to unseen cameras, and flexibility to match different user-preference styles. To demonstrate the advantages of this design, we built a user-interactive photo-editing tool that leverages our neural ISP to support diverse editing operations and picture styles. The tool is carefully engineered to take advantage of the high-quality rendering of our neural ISP and to enable unlimited post-editable re-rendering. Our method is a fully learning-based framework with variants of different capacities, all of moderate size (ranging from ~0.5 M to ~3.9 M parameters for the entire pipeline), and consistently delivers competitive qualitative and quantitative results across multiple test sets.

To mitigate these biases, existing approaches frequently depend on curated prompt datasets - either manually constructed or generated with large language models (LLMs) - as part of their training and/or evaluation procedures. Beside the curation cost, this also risks overlooking unanticipated, less obvious prompts that trigger biased generation, even in models that have undergone debiasing. In this work, we introduce Bias-Guided Prompt Search (BGPS), a framework that automatically generates prompts that aim to maximize the presence of biases in the resulting images. BGPS comprises two components: (1) an LLM instructed to produce attribute-neutral prompts and (2) attribute classifiers acting on the TTI's internal representations that steer the decoding process of the LLM toward regions of the prompt space that amplify the image attributes of interest. We conduct extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and a state-of-the-art debiased model and discover an array of subtle and previously undocumented biases that severely deteriorate fairness metrics. Crucially, the discovered prompts are interpretable, i.e they may be entered by a typical user, quantitatively improving the perplexity metric compared to a prominent hard prompt optimization counterpart. Our findings uncover TTI vulnerabilities, while BGPS expands the bias search space and can act as a new evaluation tool for bias mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBias-Guided Prompt Search (BGPS)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6216LLM\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u9057\u6f0f\u672a\u9884\u89c1\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u89e6\u53d1\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "BGPS\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u751f\u6210\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7684LLM\uff1b(2) \u4f5c\u7528\u4e8eTTI\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5411\u653e\u5927\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728Stable Diffusion 1.5\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u53bb\u504f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u91cf\u7ec6\u5fae\u4e14\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u88ab\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "BGPS\u63ed\u793a\u4e86TTI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Existing methods have improved robustness but typically rely on fixed or batch-level thresholds, which cannot account for varying difficulty across classes and instances. This limitation is especially problematic in semantic segmentation, where each image requires dense, multi-class predictions. We propose an approach that adaptively adjusts pseudo labels to reflect the confidence distribution within each image and dynamically balances learning toward classes most affected by domain shifts. This fine-grained, class- and instance-aware adaptation produces more reliable supervision and mitigates error accumulation throughout continual adaptation.

While high-throughput multiomics data is becoming increasingly abundant, converting this data into actionable predictive models remains a bottleneck. High-capacity, datadriven simulation systems are critical in this landscape; unlike classical mechanistic models restricted by prior knowledge, these architectures can infer latent interactions directly from observational data, allowing for the simulation of temporal trajectories and the anticipation of downstream intervention effects in personalized medicine and synthetic biology. To address this challenge, we introduce Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) as a dynamic framework for learning the complex interplay between the proteome and metabolome. We applied this framework to time-series data derived from engineered Escherichia coli strains, modeling the continuous dynamics of metabolic pathways. The proposed NODE architecture demonstrates superior performance in capturing system dynamics compared to traditional machine learning pipelines. Our results show a greater than 90% improvement in root mean squared error over baselines across both Limonene (up to 94.38% improvement) and Isopentenol (up to 97.65% improvement) pathway datasets.

In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEAP\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u6dfb\u52a0\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u8282\u70b9\u5e76\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8282\u70b9\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u53c8\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u7406\u60f3\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLEAP\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u672c\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528actor-critic\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u8282\u70b9\u5e76\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u7ea7\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5404\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5168\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cLEAP\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u6dfb\u52a0\u63d0\u793a\u662f\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0cLEAP\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing. Additionally, our approach showed improvements in video quality over existing techniques. Furthermore, we implemented several synthesis options for the proposed view-synthesis method and conducted a user study to assess surgeons' preferences for each option.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u906e\u6321\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891", "motivation": "\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u62cd\u6444\u4e2d\u533b\u751f\u8eab\u4f53\u4f1a\u906e\u6321\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u91ce\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u8c03\u6574\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5927\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e14\u6bcf\u6b21\u8c03\u6574\u706f\u5149\u65f6\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u706f\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u5e27\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u906e\u6321\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u9009\u9879\u4f9b\u9009\u62e9", "result": "\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u786e\u8ba4\u624b\u672f\u533a\u57df\u548c\u89c2\u770b\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u4e5f\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5408\u6210\u9009\u9879\u7684\u504f\u597d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u8d44\u6e90"}}

From an initial pool of 28k generated sequences, we identified seven putative TPS enzymes that satisfied all validation criteria.

The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower. We addressed the performance gap issue through dataset expansion using automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement. These techniques, applied to holographic images, improved detection performance from 2.49% to 13.3% mAP50 and classification performance from 42% to 54%.

Building on the success of TabPFN for tabular data and its recent extension to time series, we investigate whether graph node classification can be effectively reformulated as a tabular learning problem. We introduce TabPFN-GN, which transforms graph data into tabular features by extracting node attributes, structural properties, positional encodings, and optionally smoothed neighborhood features. This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs.

Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias. This bias leads the model to rely on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness in classification. We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of \"emptiness\" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness.

This joint counterfactual distribution provides richer information than the uplift but is harder to estimate. However, the two approaches are synergistic: uplift models can be leveraged for counterfactual estimation. We propose a counterfactual estimator that fits a bivariate beta distribution to predicted uplift scores, yielding posterior distributions over counterfactual outcomes.

This task holds promise for real-world applications such as low-altitude inspection, search-and-rescue, and autonomous aerial delivery. Existing methods often rely on panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry to support spatial reasoning and action planning. These requirements increase system cost and integration complexity, thus hindering practical deployment for lightweight UAVs. We present a unified aerial VLN framework that operates solely on egocentric monocular RGB observations and natural language instructions. The model formulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem, jointly optimizing spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction through prompt-guided multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose a keyframe selection strategy to reduce visual redundancy by retaining semantically informative frames, along with an action merging and label reweighting mechanism that mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalance and facilitates stable multi-task co-training. Extensive experiments on the Aerial VLN benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method. Under the challenging monocular RGB-only setting, our model achieves strong results across both seen and unseen environments.

With the rising focus on spatial AI in recent years, combining SLAM with semantic understanding has become increasingly important for enabling intelligent perception and interaction.

In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding. To achieve our goal, we leverage recent advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), including MASt3R for visual geometry and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. These models provide robust generalization across diverse tasks, enabling accurate monocular camera tracking and mapping, as well as a rich understanding of semantics in open-world environments. Our method operates without any depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, relying solely on self-supervised learning objectives. Furthermore, we propose a memory mechanism specifically designed to manage high-dimensional semantic features, which effectively constructs Gaussian semantic feature maps, leading to strong overall performance.

This work introduces Weather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO), a novel framework for generating targeted adversarial perturbations that are both effective in manipulating forecasts and stealthy to avoid detection. WAAPO achieves this by incorporating constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness, ensuring that perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible. Using the ERA5 dataset and FourCastNet (Pathak et al. 2022), we demonstrate WAAPO's ability to generate adversarial trajectories that align closely with predefined targets, even under constrained conditions. Our experiments highlight critical vulnerabilities in AI-driven forecasting models, where small perturbations to initial conditions can result in significant deviations in predicted weather patterns. These findings underscore the need for robust safeguards to protect against adversarial exploitation in operational forecasting systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "WAAPO\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9AI\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u6270\u52a8\u65e2\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u9690\u853d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u514d\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWeather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728ERA5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cFourCastNet\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cWAAPO\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9884\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u7d27\u5bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u663e\u793aAI\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Such group-based approaches risk obscuring biases faced by outliers within subgroups. This study introduces a distribution-based framework for evaluating and mitigating individual fairness in skin lesion classification. We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS).

From an optical standpoint, perspective-based blur is depth-position-dependent: objects residing at distinct spatial locations incur different blur levels even under the same imaging settings. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that estimate metric depth by examining the blur pattern of a video stream and dense trajectory via joint optical design algorithm. Specifically, we employ off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information. Then, we estimate depth map via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densify the sparse trajectory from the optical algorithm using a vision-language model. Evaluations on multiple depth datasets demonstrate that our method attains strong performance over large depth range, while maintaining favorable generalization.

For linear approximation, TD($\u03bb$) has been shown to minimise the squared error between the approximate value of each state and the true value. However, as far as policy is concerned, it is error in the relative ordering of states that is critical, rather than error in the state values. We illustrate this point, both in simple two-state and three-state systems in which TD($\u03bb$)--starting from an optimal policy--converges to a sub-optimal policy, and also in backgammon.

The proposed approach achieves up to a 27.3% improvement in Fr\u00e9chet inception distance across various diffusion-based models, demonstrating consistently strong performance on diverse datasets. It also shows robust effectiveness across different tasks, including image generation, text-to-image generation, and inpainting.

L_acc enforces consistency in the discrete second-order temporal differences of the generated motion, thereby aligning the diffusion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. We integrate L_acc into the training objective of an existing diffusion model, finetune the model to obtain an IMU-specific motion prior, and evaluate the model with an existing text-to-IMU framework that comprises surface modelling and virtual sensor simulation. We analysed acceleration signal fidelity and differences between synthetic motion representation and actual IMU recordings. As a downstream application, we evaluated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and compared the classification performance using data of our method with the earlier diffusion model and two additional diffusion model baselines. When we augmented the earlier diffusion model objective with L_acc and continued training, L_acc decreased by 12.7% relative to the original model. The improvements were considerably larger in high-dynamic activities (i.e., running, jumping) compared to low-dynamic activities~(i.e., sitting, standing). In a low-dimensional embedding, the synthetic IMU data produced by our refined model shifts closer to the distribution of real IMU recordings. HAR classification trained exclusively on our refined synthetic IMU data improved performance by 8.7% compared to the earlier diffusion model and by 7.6% over the best-performing comparison diffusion model.

Preserving high-frequency details (e.g., text edges and lines) is critical in this process because shadows often obscure or distort fine structures. This paper proposes a matte vision transformer (MatteViT), a novel shadow removal framework that applies spatial and frequency-domain information to eliminate shadows while preserving fine-grained structural details. To effectively retain these details, we employ two preservation strategies. First, our method introduces a lightweight high-frequency amplification module (HFAM) that decomposes and adaptively amplifies high-frequency components. Second, we present a continuous luminance-based shadow matte, generated using a custom-built matte dataset and shadow matte generator, which provides precise spatial guidance from the earliest processing stage.

Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faChain-of-Image Generation\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u827a\u672f\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u662f\"\u9ed1\u76d2\"\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9010\u6b65\u6307\u4ee4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6309\u8ba1\u5212\u9010\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9e\u4f53", "result": "CoIG\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9a\u91cf\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u5b9e\u4f53\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "CoIG\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6765\u7c7b\u4f3cChain-of-Thought\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u3001\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u53ef\u96c6\u6210"}}

Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA impose strict controls on data handling, making it difficult to balance the need for insights with privacy requirements. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that reflect real patterns without exposing sensitive information. However, traditional synthetic data methods often fail to capture complex, implicit rules that link different elements of the data and are essential in domains like healthcare. They may reproduce explicit patterns but overlook domain-specific constraints that are not directly stated yet crucial for realism and utility. For example, prescription guidelines that restrict certain medications for specific conditions or prevent harmful drug interactions may not appear explicitly in the original data. Synthetic data generated without these implicit rules can lead to medically inappropriate or unrealistic profiles. To address this gap, we propose ContextGAN, a Context-Aware Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network that integrates domain-specific rules through a constraint matrix encoding both explicit and implicit knowledge. The constraint-aware discriminator evaluates synthetic data against these rules to ensure adherence to domain constraints, while differential privacy protects sensitive details from the original data. We validate ContextGAN across healthcare, security, and finance, showing that it produces high-quality synthetic data that respects domain rules and preserves privacy. Our results demonstrate that ContextGAN improves realism and utility by enforcing domain constraints, making it suitable for applications that require compliance with both explicit patterns and implicit rules under strict privacy guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faContextGAN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u77e9\u9635\u6574\u5408\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u7b26\u5408\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5904\u65b9\u6307\u5357\u3001\u836f\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9650\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u6216\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faContextGAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u77e9\u9635\u7f16\u7801\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5224\u522b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6280\u672f\u4fdd\u62a4\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cContextGAN\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e2\u5c0a\u91cd\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u53c8\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ContextGAN\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\u9075\u5b88\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This work addresses the need for a lightweight architecture that overcomes these constraints. We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples. Moreover, pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning are used to learn domain-invariant features robust to driver and background variation. Experiments on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset show that C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models.

Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fed-SE\uff1a\u8054\u90a6\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u8fdb\u5316-\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7ea618%\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFed-SE\u8054\u90a6\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u8fdb\u5316-\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u5c40\u90e8\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u805a\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7684\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFed-SE\u76f8\u6bd4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea618%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Fed-SE\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u8026\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A dispersed-based strategy that encourages strong separation among in-batch latent representations alleviates this specific dependency. To assess the effect of the number of negative samples in generative modeling, we propose {\\mname}, a plug-and-play training framework that requires no external encoders. Our method integrates a memory bank mechanism that maintains a large, dynamically updated queue of negative samples across training iterations. This decouples the number of negatives from the mini-batch size, providing abundant and high-quality negatives for a contrastive objective without a multiplicative increase in computational cost. A low-dimensional projection head is used to further minimize memory and bandwidth overhead. {\\mname} offers three principal advantages: (1) it is self-contained, eliminating dependency on pretrained vision foundation models and their associated forward-pass overhead; (2) it introduces no additional parameters or computational cost during inference; and (3) it enables substantially faster convergence, achieving superior generative quality more efficiently.

In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u751f\u6210\u8868\u683c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f1a\u91cd\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLevAtt\u7684\u65e0\u76d2\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u79cd\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u683c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5fae\u8c03\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f1a\u91cd\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u79cd\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LevAtt\u65e0\u76d2\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bbf\u95ee\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u6270\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u751a\u81f3\u6210\u4e3a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6210\u5458\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\u51fb\u8d25\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LevAtt\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint. In streaming video understanding scenarios, it sustains a stable 24 FPS real-time prefill speed while preserving long-term memory cache.

However, these generative methods have been proven to struggle to capture high-level discriminative features effectively, leading to poor performance on linear probing and other downstream tasks. In contrast, contrastive methods excel in discriminative feature representation and generalization ability on image data. Despite this, contrastive learning (CL) in 3D data remains scarce. Besides, simply applying CL methods designed for 2D data to 3D fails to effectively learn 3D local details. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Branch \\textbf{C}enter-\\textbf{S}urrounding \\textbf{Con}trast (CSCon) framework. Specifically, we apply masking to the center and surrounding parts separately, constructing dual-branch inputs with center-biased and surrounding-biased representations to better capture rich geometric information. Meanwhile, we introduce a patch-level contrastive loss to further enhance both high-level information and local sensitivity. Under the FULL and ALL protocols, CSCon achieves performance comparable to generative methods; under the MLP-LINEAR, MLP-3, and ONLY-NEW protocols, our method attains state-of-the-art results, even surpassing cross-modal approaches. In particular, under the MLP-LINEAR protocol, our method outperforms the baseline (Point-MAE) by \\textbf{7.9\\%}, \\textbf{6.7\\%}, and \\textbf{10.3\\%} on the three variants of ScanObjectNN, respectively.

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift.

A Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Semantic Attribute Importance", "comment": null, "summary": "State-of-the-art person re-identification methods achieve impressive accuracy but remain largely opaque, leaving open the question: which high-level semantic attributes do these models actually rely on? We propose MoSAIC-ReID, a Mixture-of-Experts framework that systematically quantifies the importance of pedestrian attributes for re-identification. Our approach uses LoRA-based experts, each linked to a single attribute, and an oracle router that enables controlled attribution analysis. While MoSAIC-ReID achieves competitive performance on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC under the assumption that attribute annotations are available at test time, its primary value lies in providing a large-scale, quantitative study of attribute importance across intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Using generalized linear models, statistical tests, and feature-importance analyses, we reveal which attributes, such as clothing colors and intrinsic characteristics, contribute most strongly, while infrequent cues (e.g. accessories) have limited effect. This work offers a principled framework for interpretable ReID and highlights the requirements for integrating explicit semantic knowledge in practice.

However, directly applying these models to Full Surround Monocular Depth Estimation (FSMDE) presents two major challenges: (1) high computational cost, which limits real-time performance, and (2) difficulty in estimating metric-scale depth, as these models are typically trained to predict only relative depth. To address these limitations, we propose a novel knowledge distillation strategy that transfers robust depth knowledge from a foundation model to a lightweight FSMDE network. Our approach leverages a hybrid regression framework combining the knowledge distillation scheme--traditionally used in classification--with a depth binning module to enhance scale consistency. Specifically, we introduce a cross-interaction knowledge distillation scheme that distills the scale-invariant depth bin probabilities of a foundation model into the student network while guiding it to infer metric-scale depth bin centers from ground-truth depth. Furthermore, we propose view-relational knowledge distillation, which encodes structural relationships among adjacent camera views and transfers them to enhance cross-view depth consistency. Experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional supervised methods and existing knowledge distillation approaches.

While these approaches have made progress, they often face challenges in precise localization or require complex pipelines to combine separate modules, especially in remote sensing scenarios where numerous dense and small targets are present. Recently, Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) was proposed, unifying segmentation and recognition in a promptable framework. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of applying SAM 3 to the remote sensing OVSS task without any training. First, we implement a mask fusion strategy that combines the outputs from SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and the Transformer decoder (instance head). This allows us to leverage the strengths of both heads for better land coverage. Second, we utilize the presence score from the presence head to filter out categories that do not exist in the scene, reducing false positives caused by the vast vocabulary sizes and patch-level processing in geospatial scenes. We evaluate our method on extensive remote sensing datasets. Experiments show that this simple adaptation achieves promising performance, demonstrating the potential of SAM 3 for remote sensing OVSS.

However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\\% accuracy and 60.00\\% F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pose-based framework for Sign Language Spotting, establishing a strong foundation for future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

We propose an annotation-free training framework that improves both reasoning and grounding. Our framework uses AI-powered verifiers: an LLM verifier refines LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, while a VLM verifier strengthens visual grounding through automated hard-negative mining, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. This design combines the strengths of modern AI systems: advanced language-only reasoning models for decomposing spatial queries into simpler subtasks, and strong vision specialist models improved via performant VLM critics. We evaluate our approach across diverse spatial reasoning tasks, and show that our method improves visual reasoning and surpasses open-source and proprietary models, while with our improved visual grounding model we further outperform recent text-only visual reasoning methods.

However, developing accurate detection and segmentation models requires large, precisely annotated datasets that are costly to produce. Synthetic data provides a scalable alternative, yet often lacks sufficient realism to generalize to real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel workflow that integrates 3D rendering in Blender with a constrained diffusion model to automatically generate high-quality annotated, photorealistic synthetic images of Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms. This approach preserves full control over 3D scene configuration and annotations while achieving photorealism without the need for specialized computer graphics expertise. We release two synthetic datasets (each containing 6,000 images depicting over 250k mushroom instances) and evaluate Mask R-CNN models trained on them in a zero-shot setting. When tested on two independent real-world datasets (including a newly collected benchmark), our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance (F1 = 0.859 on M18K), despite using only synthetic training data.

To address these challenges, this study proposes a skewness-guided pruning method that selectively prunes the Multi-Head Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron layers of a multimodal Swin Transformer based on the statistical skewness of their output distributions.

However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process.

Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations.

To bridge this gap, we propose LoFA, a general framework that efficiently predicts personalized priors for fast model adaptation. We first identify a key property of LoRA: structured distribution patterns emerge in the relative changes between LoRA and base model parameters. Building on this, we design a two-stage hypernetwork: first predicting relative distribution patterns that capture key adaptation regions, then using these to guide final LoRA weight prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently predicts high-quality personalized priors within seconds, across multiple tasks and user prompts, even outperforming conventional LoRA that requires hours of processing.

Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization. By comparison, generative methods yield significant improvements in compositional generalization, without requiring additional data, by leveraging suitable inductive biases on a decoder along with search and replay.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e0e\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u53cd\u6f14\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u83b7\u5f97\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u53cd\u6f14\u83b7\u5f97\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u6210\u529f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u662f\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1f\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\uff09\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u5b9e\u65bd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u6f14\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u548c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u83b7\u5f97\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u53cd\u6f14\uff08\u641c\u7d22\u6216\u56de\u653e\uff09\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u53cd\u6f14\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u65bd\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u8fd9\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite impressive capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fail under realistic scene changes. We present Tri-Bench, a compact benchmark of planar triangle problems that isolates relative geometric reasoning while stressing two deployment-critical factors: camera pose (planar vs. tilted) and scene context via object interference (10 everyday objects). To test verifiability and control, we evaluate four recent VLMs using a single, fixed prompt whose guardrail explicitly describes a surrounding square border, enabling correct answers via homography. We evaluate six simple tasks over binary and continuous targets, and observe that the overall accuracy with respect to 3D ground truth is modest, ~69% on average (best ~75%, worst ~64%). The same responses align even more closely with 2D projections in the image plane, where mean accuracy is ~72%. All four VLMs consistently fail, with accuracy falling to ~0%, on recognizing minority shape classes (equilateral, isosceles, right-angled triangles). Additionally, overall VLM accuracy degrades by ~4.1% under camera tilt. This demonstrates that models fail to correctly utilize the explicit frame-of-reference hint provided in the prompt and default to 2D image plane cues. Finally, we find that object interference has no significant effect on VLM accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tri-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5e73\u9762\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5177\u6709\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7ecf\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30VLMs\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTri-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5e73\u9762\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u76f8\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\uff08\u5e73\u9762vs\u503e\u659c\uff09\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5e72\u6270\uff0810\u4e2a\u65e5\u5e38\u7269\u4f53\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u660e\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\u8fb9\u6846\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u83b7\u5f97\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0VLMs\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a69%\uff08\u6700\u4f7375%\uff0c\u6700\u5dee64%\uff09\u3002\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5e73\u97622D\u6295\u5f71\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff08\u7ea672%\uff09\u3002\u6240\u6709\u56db\u4e2aVLM\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5c11\u6570\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u7b49\u8fb9\u3001\u7b49\u8170\u3001\u76f4\u89d2\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\uff09\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u81f3\u7ea60%\u3002\u76f8\u673a\u503e\u659c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea64.1%\u3002\u7269\u4f53\u5e72\u6270\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dVLMs\u672a\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u660e\u786e\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4f7f\u75282D\u56fe\u50cf\u5e73\u9762\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u6b8a\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002"}}

In this work, we enhance VLM-based visual grounding in satellite imagery by proposing a novel structured localization mechanism. Our approach involves finetuning a pretrained VLM on a diverse set of instruction-following tasks, while interfacing a dedicated grounding module through specialized control tokens for localization. This method facilitates joint reasoning over both language and spatial information, significantly enhancing the model's ability to precisely localize objects in complex satellite scenes. We evaluate our framework on several remote sensing benchmarks, consistently improving the state-of-the-art, including a 24.8% relative improvement over previous methods on visual grounding.

Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles.\n  Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\\(\\times\\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\\(\\times\\)1024 inputs. Integrated into a U-Net segmentation model, the framework yields up to 6% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdGPU\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5377\u79ef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u65cb\u8f6c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u5377\u79ef\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5177\u6709\u4efb\u610f\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5272\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u67b6\u6784\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u5c55\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u65b9\u5411\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d41\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86GPU\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5377\u79ef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfim2col\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u65cb\u8f6c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4CUDNN\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534720-55%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e15-45%\uff1b\u57288\u65b9\u5411\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c256\u00d7256\u8f93\u5165\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534745%\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e41%\uff0c1024\u00d71024\u8f93\u5165\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534732%\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e23%\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u5230U-Net\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u53476%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8CNN\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

The variety of real-world applications makes it highly challenging to develop a single model capable of unifying the diverse range of input-constrained generation sub-tasks, such as those conditioned by element types, sizes, or their relationships. Current methods either address only a subset of these tasks or necessitate separate model parameters for different conditions, failing to offer a truly unified solution. In this paper, we propose UniLayDiff: a Unified Diffusion Transformer, that for the first time, addresses various content-aware layout generation tasks with a single, end-to-end trainable model. Specifically, we treat layout constraints as a distinct modality and employ Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture the complex interplay between the background image, layout elements, and diverse constraints. Moreover, we integrate relation constraints through fine-tuning the model with LoRA after pretraining the model on other tasks. Such a schema not only achieves unified conditional generation but also enhances overall layout quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniLayDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across from unconditional to various conditional generation tasks and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to unify the full range of content-aware layout generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniLayDiff\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c06\u5e03\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u662f\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u5f00\u53d1\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u5404\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5143\u7d20\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u6216\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniLayDiff\u7edf\u4e00\u6269\u6563Transformer\uff0c\u5c06\u5e03\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563Transformer\u6846\u67b6\u6355\u6349\u80cc\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u591a\u6837\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniLayDiff\u5728\u4ece\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5b8c\u6574\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "UniLayDiff\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u5e03\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent image-to-3D generators recover reasonable geometry from single views, but their object-centric training limits generalization to complex, large-scale scenes with faithful structure and texture. We present EvoScene, a self-evolving, training-free framework that progressively reconstructs complete 3D scenes from single images. The key idea is combining the complementary strengths of existing models: geometric reasoning from 3D generation models and visual knowledge from video generation models. Through three iterative stages--Spatial Prior Initialization, Visual-guided 3D Scene Mesh Generation, and Spatial-guided Novel View Generation--EvoScene alternates between 2D and 3D domains, gradually improving both structure and appearance.

We introduce Lighting-driven Dynamic Active Sensing (LiDAS), a closed-loop active illumination system that combines off-the-shelf visual perception models with high-definition headlights. Rather than uniformly brightening the scene, LiDAS dynamically predicts an optimal illumination field that maximizes downstream perception performance, i.e., decreasing light on empty areas to reallocate it on object regions. LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control. Trained on synthetic data and deployed zero-shot in real-world closed-loop driving scenarios, LiDAS enables +18.7% mAP50 and +5.0% mIoU over standard low-beam at equal power. It maintains performances while reducing energy use by 40%. LiDAS complements domain-generalization methods, further strengthening robustness without retraining.

While diffusion models provide strong generative priors for general image restoration, they often produce text hallucinations in text-centric tasks due to the absence of explicit linguistic knowledge. To address this, we propose UniT, a unified text restoration framework that integrates a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and a Text Spotting Module (TSM) in an iterative fashion for high-fidelity text restoration. In UniT, the VLM extracts textual content from degraded images to provide explicit textual guidance. Simultaneously, the TSM, trained on diffusion features, generates intermediate OCR predictions at each denoising step, enabling the VLM to iteratively refine its guidance during the denoising process. Finally, the DiT backbone, leveraging its strong representational power, exploit these cues to recover fine-grained textual content while effectively suppressing text hallucinations.

This paper introduces D4RT, a simple yet powerful feedforward model designed to efficiently solve this task. D4RT utilizes a unified transformer architecture to jointly infer depth, spatio-temporal correspondence, and full camera parameters from a single video. Its core innovation is a novel querying mechanism that sidesteps the heavy computation of dense, per-frame decoding and the complexity of managing multiple, task-specific decoders. Our decoding interface allows the model to independently and flexibly probe the 3D position of any point in space and time. The result is a lightweight and highly scalable method that enables remarkably efficient training and inference. We demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous methods across a wide spectrum of 4D reconstruction tasks.
