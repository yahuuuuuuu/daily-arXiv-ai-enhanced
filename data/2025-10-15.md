### [1] [Enhancing the Quality of 3D Lunar Maps Using JAXA's Kaguya Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11817)
*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种改进Kaguya地形相机图像生成3D月球地图质量的方法，通过减少压缩图像生成的视差图中的残差噪声来提升高程精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着月球探索任务增加，高质量3D月球地图需求日益重要。Kaguya TC图像虽全球覆盖，但存在立体匹配误差和JPEG压缩伪影导致的高程不准确问题。

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别系统性视差噪声模式，特别是在较暗区域。提出减少压缩图像视差图中残差噪声的方法来提升3D地图质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法能有效减少高程噪声，提升地形数据的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法能改善Kaguya TC图像生成的3D月球地图质量，为未来月球任务提供更可靠的地形数据。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于自监督模型DINO，这种优势主要源于CLIP的语言监督使其能捕获高级语义特征，而DINO更关注低级视觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于DINO的原因，是源于语言监督还是更大训练数据的影响。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO模型，分析其嵌入特征，并集成到视觉语言模型中进行20个VQA基准测试。

Result: CLIP在文本密集型任务上表现优异，DINO在视觉中心任务上略有优势；语言监督变体带来的增益有限。

Conclusion: CLIP的语言监督使其能更好地捕获高级语义信息，这解释了其在视觉语言模型中的优势，为视觉编码器设计提供了科学见解。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

### [3] [MammoDINO: Anatomically Aware Self-Supervision for Mammographic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11883)
*Sicheng Zhou,Lei Wu,Cao Xiao,Parminder Bhatia,Taha Kass-Hout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MammoDINO是一个用于乳腺X线摄影的自监督学习框架，在140万张乳腺图像上预训练，通过乳腺组织感知数据增强和跨切片对比学习，在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在通用领域已成功应用于视觉编码器训练，但在医学影像中由于数据有限和领域特定偏差而应用不足。本文旨在为乳腺X线摄影开发一个有效的自监督学习框架。

Method: 提出MammoDINO框架，包含乳腺组织感知数据增强采样器（用于图像级和补丁级监督）和跨切片对比学习目标，将3D数字乳腺断层合成结构融入2D预训练。

Result: 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能，并在五个基准数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MammoDINO为乳腺X线摄影提供了一个可扩展、无需标注的多用途计算机辅助诊断工具基础，有助于减轻放射科医生工作量并提高乳腺癌筛查的诊断效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

### [4] [Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768)
*Fengzhi Guo,Chih-Chuan Hsu,Sihao Ding,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D：一种不确定性感知的动态高斯溅射框架，通过建模每个高斯基元的时间变化不确定性来改善4D重建质量，特别是在遮挡和极端视角下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的动态高斯溅射方法对所有高斯基元进行均匀优化，忽略了它们在时间和视角上的可见性差异，导致在遮挡情况下出现运动漂移，在未见视角下合成质量下降。

Method: 提出USplat4D框架，估计每个高斯基元的时间变化不确定性，并利用这些不确定性构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，将可靠的运动线索传播到整个场景。

Result: 在多个真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性能够持续改进动态高斯溅射模型，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，在极端视角下实现高质量的合成。

Conclusion: 不确定性建模对于动态3D场景重建至关重要，USplat4D通过不确定性感知优化有效解决了遮挡和极端视角下的重建挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双模型框架，利用VideoLLaMA和Qwen2.5-VL的互补优势，通过任务特定优化来提升交通视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通视频安全分析需要复杂的视频理解能力来捕捉细粒度行为模式并生成全面描述以预防事故。

Method: 采用双模型框架，分别训练VideoLLaMA用于视频描述任务，Qwen2.5-VL用于视觉问答任务，通过任务分离避免任务干扰。

Result: 在WTS数据集上，VideoLLaMA在时间推理方面表现优异（CIDEr得分1.1001），Qwen2.5-VL在视觉理解方面表现突出（VQA准确率60.80%），在2025 AI City Challenge Track 2中获得S2得分45.7572，排名第10。

Conclusion: 分离训练策略比联合训练在VQA准确率上提升8.6%，同时保持视频描述质量，证明了任务特定优化的有效性。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [6] [MVP4D: Multi-View Portrait Video Diffusion for Animatable 4D Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12785)
*Felix Taubner,Ruihang Zhang,Mathieu Tuli,Sherwin Bahmani,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP4D是一个基于预训练视频扩散模型的系统，能够从单张参考图像生成可动画的多视角数字人视频，并蒸馏为实时渲染的4D虚拟化身，显著提升了真实感、时间一致性和3D一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创建和动画化照片级真实人类虚拟化身的过程昂贵且耗时，需要大型相机捕捉设备和专业3D艺术家的手动工作。现有单图生成方法虽然降低了创作门槛，但缺乏多视角信息或显式3D表示的约束，导致视角偏离参考图像时质量下降。

Method: 基于最先进的预训练视频扩散模型，从单张参考图像和目标表情生成可动画的多视角视频，可同时生成数百帧，视角变化范围达360度，并将输出蒸馏为可实时渲染的4D虚拟化身。

Result: 与先前方法相比，该方法显著提高了生成虚拟化身的真实感、时间一致性和3D一致性，能够从不同视角生成高质量的数字人动画。

Conclusion: MVP4D系统通过结合视频扩散模型和多视角生成能力，有效解决了单图生成虚拟化身的视角限制问题，为数字人创建提供了更高效、更真实的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

### [7] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net是一个从单张全景图像估计3D房间布局的新模型，结合CNN和薄板样条变换，能有效处理立方体和非立方体布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间3D布局在机器人、增强现实和室内设计中有重要应用，需要能够处理各种复杂布局的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：CNN提取特征并学习TPS变换参数，然后TPS变换层将参考布局变形为目标布局。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，3DIoU值分别达到85.49、86.16、81.76和91.98。

Conclusion: 模型在房间布局估计中准确且鲁棒，TPS变换与全景图像兼容性好，能处理各种布局类型。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种专用于仓库空间推理的框架，通过将边界框坐标嵌入输入提示来增强空间理解，在AI City Challenge Track 3中排名第4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模3D环境中的空间推理存在挑战，现有模型依赖局部外观且缺乏明确的空间基础，难以在仓库等场景中泛化。

Method: 将掩码维度（边界框坐标）嵌入输入提示，使模型能够推理对象几何和布局；在四个问题类别上进行任务特定的微调；在训练集中向GPT响应添加规范化答案。

Result: 最终得分为73.0606，在公共排行榜上排名第4。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境空间推理方面是有效的。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [9] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM能提供最忠实和定位准确的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，模型决策的可解释性直接影响临床信任和采用。Vision Transformers在诊断影像中表现出色，但其复杂的注意力机制给可解释性带来挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM评估ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer等不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略的可解释性，在血液细胞分类和乳腺超声图像分类任务上进行定量和定性分析。

Result: DINO结合Grad-CAM在所有数据集中提供最忠实和定位准确的解释。Grad-CAM始终产生类别区分性和空间精确的热力图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在错误分类情况下，DINO与Grad-CAM也能突出显示误导模型的临床相关形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，这项研究支持将Vision Transformers可靠且可解释地集成到关键的医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临水下图像退化（低对比度、颜色失真）和海洋生物自然伪装两大挑战，传统图像增强技术难以恢复关键特征，陆地场景的伪装目标检测方法无法适应水下光学特性

Method: 提出APGNet自适应先验引导网络，采用孪生架构和先验引导机制：1）使用MSRCR算法进行数据增强生成光照不变图像；2）设计扩展感受野模块和多尺度渐进解码器；3）提出自适应先验引导机制，在高层特征嵌入空间注意力进行粗定位，在低层特征使用可变形卷积细化轮廓

Result: 在两个公共MAS数据集上的实验结果表明，APGNet在广泛使用的评估指标下优于15种最先进方法

Conclusion: APGNet通过集成图像增强、多尺度特征提取和自适应先验引导机制，有效解决了水下伪装目标检测的挑战，显著提升了检测性能

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Method: 利用姿态和位置先验学习源视频的通用运动表示，生成保持原始运动但结构和语义可变的新视频。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidMP3通过运动表示学习解决了视频编辑中的关键挑战，实现了灵活的结构和语义编辑。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [15] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应双网络(ADNet)用于QR码去模糊，包含EG-Restormer处理严重模糊和LENet处理轻度模糊，通过边缘引导注意力块嵌入显式边缘先验，显著提升解码率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少显式利用QR码高度结构化模式和锐利边缘的先验，而QR码去模糊的关键是确保成功解码而非感知质量。

Method: 提出边缘引导注意力块(EGAB)将显式边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此开发EG-Restormer处理严重模糊；设计轻量高效网络(LENet)处理轻度模糊；集成两者形成自适应双网络(ADNet)根据模糊程度动态选择网络。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，EG-Restormer和ADNet在保持竞争性速度的同时实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过显式利用QR码的结构化边缘先验，有效提升了模糊QR码的解码成功率，特别适合资源受限的移动设备。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用平面结构生成精确深度图的方法，通过几何引导改进生成式3D场景重建，解决了现有方法在观测和未观测区域的几何质量差和多视图不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的3D场景重建方法缺乏可靠的几何监督，导致重建质量不佳，特别是在未观测区域，并且存在多视图不一致性问题，造成形状-外观歧义和几何退化。

Method: 利用平面结构生成精确度量尺度深度图，在生成流程中融入几何引导来改进可见性掩码估计、指导新视角选择，并使用视频扩散模型增强多视图一致性补全。

Result: 在Replica、ScanNet++和DeepBlending数据集上的实验表明，该方法在几何和外观重建方面均优于现有基线，特别是在未观测区域，且支持单视图输入和无位姿视频。

Conclusion: 准确的几何是有效利用生成模型增强3D场景重建的关键前提，该方法在室内外场景中都具有良好的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了判别表示学习(DRL)框架解决非排练类增量学习中的三个难题：模型复杂度增长、表示空间不平稳变化、阶段优化与全局推理不一致。通过增量并行适配器(IPA)网络和平稳表示转移机制实现高效增量学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在非排练类增量学习中面临的三个核心挑战：模型复杂度随增量阶段线性增长、表示空间在增量过程中发生不平稳变化、阶段优化与全局推理之间的不一致性。

Method: 提出判别表示学习(DRL)框架，包含增量并行适配器(IPA)网络和分离锚监督(DAS)。IPA通过轻量级适配器继承和传播表示能力，DAS通过虚拟锚分离正负样本约束，促进判别表示学习。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DRL在整个类增量学习周期中持续优于其他最先进方法，同时在训练和推理阶段都保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL框架有效解决了类增量学习中的关键挑战，通过平稳表示转移和特征空间对齐机制，实现了高性能和高效率的增量学习。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

TL;DR: SSDiff是一种自监督选择性引导扩散方法，用于老照片人脸修复，通过伪参考人脸进行区域选择性修复，在结构引导和颜色细化方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练扩散引导方法依赖显式退化先验或全局统计指导，难以处理局部伪影或人脸颜色问题，需要更有效的修复方法。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型在弱指导下生成伪参考人脸，通过人脸解析图和划痕掩码进行选择性修复，采用分阶段监督：结构引导贯穿去噪过程，颜色细化在后期步骤进行。

Result: 在构建的300张真实老照片基准数据集VintageFace上，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff通过自监督选择性引导扩散实现了对老照片人脸的有效修复，在多个评估指标上优于现有方法，具有更好的区域可控性。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强图像生成的广泛应用引发了未经授权使用私有图像数据集的担忧，传统数字水印方法在该系统中难以有效工作。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型合成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，并使用随机生成的字符序列作为检索键进行保护验证。

Result: 实验结果表明ImageSentinel能有效检测未经授权的数据集使用，同时保持授权应用的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为解决RAIG系统中的数据集保护问题提供了有效的解决方案，在保护版权的同时不影响合法使用。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于约束优化的编码函数设计方法，用于压缩单光子3D成像系统，在硬件限制下显著优于传统编码设计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中面临硬件限制（系统带宽、最大激光功率、传感器数据速率等），现有压缩直方图方法在真实世界照明硬件约束下表现不佳

Method: 使用梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵（即编码函数），确保符合硬件约束条件

Result: 在广泛模拟中，该方法在带宽和峰值功率约束下始终优于传统编码设计，特别是在峰值功率受限系统中优势更明显

Conclusion: 该方法能够适应任意参数化脉冲响应，在具有非理想脉冲响应函数的真实世界系统中表现良好

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为未来多模态研究提供了强大且成本效益高的视觉描述解决方案。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Conclusion: FedHUG框架有效解决了联邦学习中的异构非IID特征和标签分布偏移问题，为远程生理测量提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出KFF方法，通过类感知域知识融合与分裂机制解决持续测试时自适应中的灾难性遗忘和新知识学习不足问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型来减少灾难性遗忘，但会导致新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，造成性能下降

Method: 设计域知识分裂模块自适应分离新域知识，域知识融合模块将分裂的新知识合并到现有知识池中，采用贪心知识动态合并策略

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性

Conclusion: KFF方法能够自适应扩展和合并类感知域知识，动态积累判别性历史知识，解决CTTA中的关键挑战

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的广泛实验显示，DPL在一次性医学图像分割中取得了显著改进，建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: DPL通过将原型建模为概率分布并利用扩散过程进行特征空间探索，有效提升了在有限标注数据和显著解剖变异下的一次性医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但顺序压缩的视觉提示令牌无法有效捕捉视频的空间和时间上下文信息，限制了空间信息在视频帧内和时间信息在帧间的有效传播。

Method: 设计了帧内聚集（IFG）模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及帧间传播（IFS）模块来在不同帧间传播判别性时空信息，通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息来有效传播判别性信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的大量实验验证了SSP方法显著优于现有的SOTA方法，平均提升2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过结合帧内和帧间提示，有效聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了视频理解性能。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and

on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D提出了一种端到端的3D实例分割方法，使用边界框标注作为弱监督信号，通过师生框架生成伪掩码，避免了传统两阶段方法的复杂性和训练时间开销。

Motivation: 完全监督的3D实例分割需要密集的点级标注，成本高昂。边界框标注虽然更易获取，但在重叠区域存在歧义。现有两阶段方法训练专门的伪标签生成器，增加了复杂性和训练时间。

Method: 采用师生框架，教师模型作为伪标签生成器，通过指数移动平均从学生模型更新。引入基于实例中心的查询精炼来增强位置查询定位，并设计查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失来对齐预测与伪掩码的语义和几何信号。

Conclusion: BEEP3D提供了一种高效的端到端解决方案，能够在仅使用边界框标注的情况下实现高质量的3D实例分割，显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在计算机视觉领域的发展为物流和制造业优化工作流程提供了新机会，但AI应用常受限于专业知识和资源，导致依赖通用模型。这些模型需要领域特定数据进行微调，而收集真实数据成本高且效率低，因此使用合成数据进行微调成为成本效益高的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DIANet双流框架，利用相位感知动态图像分别编码微表情的起始-顶点和顶点-结束阶段，通过交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合特征，在多个基准数据集上优于传统单相位方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临面部线索细微短暂、标注数据有限的挑战。传统动态图像方法忽略了微表情不同时间阶段的独特特征，需要更精细的时间建模。

Method: DIANet双流框架：一个流处理起始到顶点的动态图像，另一个流处理顶点到结束的动态图像，各自使用专用CNN，通过交叉注意力模块融合特征。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于传统的单相位动态图像方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模时间相位信息对微表情识别至关重要，为推进该领域提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在推理任务上表现出色，但构建高性能推理训练数据集的原则仍不明确，需要系统研究数据整理方法对模型推理能力的影响。

Method: 通过控制训练和评估设置，分析上下文来源的影响，实施针对性数据干预（如图像描述辅助信号、纯文本推理），并探索图像、问题和思维链解决方案的规模化扩展。

Result: 研究发现上下文来源策略显著影响VLM性能，数据干预带来实质性收益，所有数据维度的扩展都能持续提升推理能力。构建的HoneyBee数据集包含250万样本，训练出的模型在MathVerse上比SOTA模型和基础模型分别提升7.8%和24.8%。

Conclusion: 本研究为视觉语言推理数据集的整理提供了改进策略，提出的测试时扩展策略能在不牺牲准确性的情况下减少73%的解码成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了并行标记预测中的结构不一致问题，实现了高效且高质量的图像和视频生成，为生成模型的商业化应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双重小波引导的不变性学习框架Ivan-ISTD，用于解决红外小目标检测中的跨域偏移和异方差噪声扰动问题，在跨域场景下表现出优异的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外小目标检测中存在的跨域偏移和异方差噪声扰动的双重挑战，传统人工噪声建模存在分布偏差限制。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用小波引导的跨域合成生成与目标域对齐的训练样本；第二阶段通过真实域噪声不变性学习，从目标域提取真实噪声特征构建动态噪声库，通过自监督损失学习噪声不变性。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个量化指标上优于现有最先进方法，特别是在跨域场景下表现出优异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的Ivan-ISTD框架有效解决了红外小目标检测中的跨域和噪声挑战，创建了Dynamic-ISTD基准数据集验证方法有效性。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

*Ye Chen,Liming Tan,Yupeng Zhu,Yuanbin Wang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用时空一致性代理节点来表示视频中动态变化对象/场景的方法，克服了传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频表示方法严重依赖不稳定且过于细粒度的运动和外观建模先验（如像素级匹配和跟踪），跟踪误差、遮挡和大运动会破坏视觉对象表示。

Method: 使用分层代理节点稳定表达视觉对象的多尺度结构，通过动态表示更新机制利用视频的时空先验，并采用形状和纹理表示的分离编码方式。

Result: 实验表明该方法以更少的参数实现了高视频重建精度，并支持复杂的视频处理任务，包括视频修复和基于关键帧的时间一致性视频编辑。

Conclusion: 所提出的代理节点表示方法能够稳定处理跟踪误差、长期运动、遮挡和视角变化，同时支持可控和细粒度的外观编辑能力。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

*Yuto Yokoi,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数：乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，在数据稀缺情况下表现优于传统损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像由于隐私、伦理和标注成本高而面临数据稀缺问题，需要鲁棒高效的训练目标。传统的交叉熵和Dice损失的加法组合对超参数敏感，在有限数据下表现不佳。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失相乘，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度。置信度自适应乘法损失在此基础上应用置信度驱动的指数缩放，整合预测概率和Dice系数来强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该框架始终优于调优的加法损失和现有损失函数。

Conclusion: 该框架为在具有挑战性的数据限制下进行鲁棒分割提供了一种简单、有效且无需超参数的机制。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Motivation: 解决神经网络在OOD数据上产生过度自信预测的问题，避免传统方法需要额外OOD数据集或生成伪OOD图像的高成本限制。

Method: 利用ID图像中的背景特征作为模拟OOD视觉表示，基于卷积的局部不变性提取背景特征，通过优化降低这些特征的L2范数来训练模型。

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，与现有后处理方法具有良好的组合兼容性，达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种低成本且有效的OOD检测解决方案，能够显著缓解模型对OOD数据的过度自信问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Motivation: 现有无监督融合方法依赖手工设计的损失函数，存在参考图像细节不足、亮度不均，以及梯度损失只关注梯度幅度的问题。

Method: 设计跨模态互补掩码模块强制学习模态间互补信息；结合拉普拉斯边缘增强和自适应直方图均衡化生成细粒度参考图像；引入同时约束梯度幅度和方向的角度感知损失。

Result: 在MSRS、RoadScene和M3FD数据集上的实验表明，AngularFuse明显优于现有主流方法，在挑战性场景中产生更清晰、更详细的结果。

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过角度感知框架有效提升了可见光-红外图像融合质量，在纹理强度和边缘方向保持方面表现出色。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Motivation: 解决当前动态3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间的权衡问题，这些方法语义不可知，对静态背景和安全关键对象分配相同资源。

Method: 1. 语义引导的剪枝和正则化策略：使用混合重要性指标简化非关键场景元素，保留导航关键对象的精细细节；2. 优先级驱动渲染管道：基于优先级的深度预传递来剔除被遮挡基元，加速最终着色计算。

Conclusion: PAGS通过注入任务感知的语义优先级，成功解决了动态3D城市场景重建中保真度与效率的权衡问题，为自动驾驶应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos

However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型中的logo幻觉问题，发现模型会在没有可见文字的logo上生成品牌名称，揭示了模型依赖符号先验而非真实字形感知的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得了显著进展，但仍然容易产生幻觉输出，即输出内容缺乏视觉证据支持。本文特别关注logo幻觉这一被忽视的问题。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和带文字的logo数据集，以及Hard-60挑战子集，系统测量主流VLMs的幻觉程度。通过9种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性，并对LLaVA进行嵌入级分析，识别导致幻觉的投影器维度。

Result: 研究发现幻觉在强失真下仍然存在，遮挡暴露了最严重的弱点。幻觉与投影器的小部分维度相关，针对性消融可显著减少错误同时保持OCR准确性。

Conclusion: VLMs往往依赖符号先验而非真正的字形感知，特别是对于标志性圆形logo。投影器子空间在这种失败模式中起决定性作用，投影器解耦和OCR引导解码是构建更可信多模态系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

TL;DR: Qualcomm AI Research提出的两阶段方法，在RealADSim-NVS挑战赛中获得第二名。该方法结合高斯溅射和扩散模型，先进行3D场景重建和视图渲染，再用扩散模型增强图像质量。


<details>

Motivation: 解决街景场景中的新视图合成问题，要求从训练轨迹的车载帧生成不同轨迹（如不同车道或行驶方向）的渲染图像。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用高斯溅射进行3D场景重建并渲染目标相机视角；2) 使用专用单步扩散模型增强生成的帧。特别关注高斯基元的初始化和增强模型的微调及训练数据管理。

Result: 在公开测试排行榜上获得综合得分0.432，总体排名第二。通过PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标评估了新视图质量。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法在街景新视图合成任务中表现优异，验证了高斯溅射与扩散模型结合的有效性。

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

TL;DR: CurriFlow是一个语义场景补全框架，通过光流时序对齐和课程学习深度融合，从单目图像推断完整的3D几何和语义信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSC方法依赖时序堆叠或深度投影，缺乏显式运动推理，难以处理遮挡和噪声深度监督。

Method: 使用预训练光流进行多级特征对齐，结合课程学习从稀疏LiDAR深度渐进过渡到密集立体深度，并利用SAM提供语义先验。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准测试中达到16.9的平均IoU，实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: 运动引导和课程感知设计有效提升了基于相机的3D语义场景补全性能。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的自适应子采样框架，通过注意力引导的动态采样机制减少深度神经网络的计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络性能提升往往伴随计算复杂度和成本增加，特别是在3D体积或视频分类任务中，由于固有的冗余性，并非所有切片或帧都是必要的

Method: 使用注意力引导的采样模块，该模块在推理过程中也能适应不同输入，克服传统方法只能任务适应而不能输入适应的局限性

Result: 在MedMNIST3D医学影像数据集和两个超声视频数据集上验证了方法的有效性，其中一个是在真实临床条件下收集的具有挑战性的内部数据集

Conclusion: 提出的动态自适应采样方法在减少深度神经网络模型复杂度的同时实现了性能提升，适用于现实世界应用

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了STORM-PSR双流框架，通过结合空间和时间特征来改进程序步骤识别，在物体部分遮挡情况下仍能准确识别步骤完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进模型仅依赖检测单个视频帧中的装配物体状态，忽视了时间特征，导致在物体部分遮挡时模型鲁棒性和准确性受限。

Method: STORM-PSR采用双流框架：装配状态检测流处理无遮挡物体视图，时空流通过空间编码器和基于transformer的时间编码器捕获空间和时间特征，即使在部分遮挡下也能识别步骤完成。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上评估，相比先前方法，平均延迟分别减少了11.2%和26.1%。时空流不依赖无遮挡物体视图即可推断步骤完成。

Conclusion: STORM-PSR通过利用时空特征显著提高了程序步骤识别的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在部分遮挡情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

TL;DR: 提出了一种概率重解释方法，通过引入高级重建先验来改进场景坐标回归模型，解决训练图像多视角约束不足时的退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 场景坐标回归模型在训练图像缺乏足够多视角约束时会退化，需要引入先验知识来提升模型性能。

Method: 将SCR模型训练重新解释为概率问题，引入多种先验：从重建深度值分布的简单先验到基于大规模室内扫描数据训练的3D点云扩散模型先验。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，先验帮助学习更好的场景表示，产生更一致的点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Conclusion: 概率重解释和高级重建先验能有效提升SCR模型的性能，特别是在训练数据约束不足的情况下。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

TL;DR: 提出基于条件流匹配(CFM)的图像质量转换框架，用于从低场MRI重建高场质量图像，在减少参数量的同时实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场磁共振成像(LF-MRI)虽然价格便宜且便携，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要一种方法在不依赖昂贵基础设施的情况下提升图像质量。

Method: 使用条件流匹配(CFM)框架，通过直接回归最优速度场来学习噪声分布与目标数据分布之间的连续流，避免了传统生成模型的迭代采样或对抗目标。

Result: CFM不仅实现了最先进的性能，而且对分布内和分布外数据都具有鲁棒性，同时使用的参数量显著少于竞争性深度学习方法。

Conclusion: CFM作为MRI重建的强大可扩展工具，在资源受限的临床环境中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体系统在长视频理解中存在两个主要问题：1）难以捕捉连续帧的时序上下文；2）稀疏帧采样可能导致关键信息丢失。

Method: 采用分层记忆结构，从粗到细渐进式定义不同层次记忆的细节程度和时序范围，通过基于智能体的迭代回溯机制系统挖掘视频范围内的深度记忆。

Conclusion: VideoLucy框架通过深度记忆回溯机制有效解决了长视频理解中的时序上下文和关键信息保留问题，在EgoMem新基准上表现出色。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Conclusion: 总结了当前研究的五大主要局限性，并概述了未来发展的有前景方向，为推进这一新兴领域奠定基础。

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Motivation: 针对深度伪造检测器在黑盒环境下的防御需求，需要开发能够生成高转移性和视觉不可察觉对抗样本的方法。

Method: 第一阶段使用双流攻击模块：MNTD-PGD优化小扰动预算的梯度计算，SG-PGD聚焦于视觉显著区域的扰动；第二阶段通过度量感知选择模块基于成功率和结构相似性评估候选样本。

Result: 与最先进攻击方法相比，MS-GAGA在未见检测器上实现了高达27%的更高误分类率。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过联合优化转移性和不可察觉性，有效提升了对抗样本在黑盒深度伪造检测器上的攻击效果。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

Conclusion: BSGS框架能够从运动模糊图像中准确重建3D场景，通过双阶段优化和梯度聚合策略有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Motivation: 现有的神经方法在学习无符号距离场时存在数值不稳定、计算成本高和可控性有限的问题，需要一种更稳健高效的解决方案来处理各种拓扑结构。

Method: 使用Voronoi辅助扩散方法：首先通过两个基于Voronoi的几何准则为输入点分配双向法向量，然后扩散对齐的法向量形成近似UDF梯度场，最后积分得到最终的无符号距离场。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D

approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度参数化的输入特征和辅助损失，但这些策略对于扩散模型匹配人体运动分布应该不是必需的。

Method: 使用分数扩散模型，仅采用特征空间归一化和分析推导的L2分数匹配损失权重，直接生成运动和形状。

Result: 在无条件人体运动生成任务中达到了与最先进方法相当的结果，避免了缓慢的关节后处理形状恢复。

Conclusion: 通过理论驱动的组件设计和针对性消融实验，证明了所提方法的有效性，为人体运动生成提供了更简洁高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

TL;DR: 提出CoIRL-AD框架，通过竞争机制结合模仿学习和强化学习，提升自动驾驶模型的泛化能力和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习泛化能力差，强化学习样本效率低且收敛不稳定，需要结合两者优势

Method: 提出竞争性双策略框架，让IL和RL智能体在训练中交互，通过竞争机制促进知识交换并避免梯度冲突

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上碰撞率降低18%，在长尾场景中表现更好，泛化能力更强

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD框架有效结合IL和RL优势，显著提升自动驾驶性能

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个无人机多光谱多目标跟踪基准MMOT，包含大规模数据集和新的多光谱方向感知跟踪方案，显著提升了小目标和密集场景的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB跟踪算法在无人机视角下依赖空间外观线索（颜色、纹理）容易失效，而多光谱图像能提供光谱反射率信息增强目标区分能力，但缺乏专门的多光谱无人机数据集阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 提出多光谱方向感知MOT方案：轻量级Spectral 3D-Stem整合光谱特征并保持RGB预训练兼容性；方向感知卡尔曼滤波器进行精确状态估计；端到端方向自适应transformer。

Result: 大量实验表明，多光谱输入相比RGB基线显著提升了跟踪性能，特别是对小目标和密集物体效果明显。

Conclusion: MMOT基准和提出的方法将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展，相关数据集、代码和基准已公开。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖交叉注意力机制融合条件与运动，但这种方法主要捕获全局交互，难以保持逐步时间对齐。

Method: 引入基于Mamba的Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，实现更好的时间对齐运动生成。

Result: 在多种人类运动任务上的广泛实验表明，该模型在时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的TCM模型通过改进的时间对齐机制，在人类运动生成任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

Motivation: 解决农业图像分割中数据标注瓶颈问题，利用现有专业植物模型来避免收集和标注新数据集的成本。

Method: 利用Plantnet的植物专用表示识别植物区域生成粗分割掩码，然后通过SAM进行精细分割。使用Plantnet微调的DinoV2模型提升性能。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上评估，使用Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基础DinoV2模型在Jaccard指数(IoU)上获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型和专业植物中心模型可以有效缓解标注瓶颈，在多样化农业场景中实现有效分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过使用扩散模型自身的中间表示作为内在指导来提升生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散模型的生成质量与其学习到的表示相关，外部指导可以加速训练。本文重新思考这一范式，提出利用模型自身的中间表示进行正则化。

Method: 基于扩散模型不同层表示质量存在差异的观察，LayerSync使用语义最丰富的表示作为内在指导来正则化较弱的表示，是一种即插即用的自监督正则化方法。

Result: 在图像生成任务上显著提升训练效率（如Flow-based Transformer在ImageNet上训练速度提升8.75倍）和生成质量（提升23.6%），并成功应用于音频、视频、运动生成等其他领域。

Conclusion: LayerSync是一种通用、自给自足的正则化方法，能够有效提升扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，且无需额外数据或预训练模型。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段训练框架，显著缩小了像素空间生成模型与潜在空间模型的性能差距，在ImageNet上实现了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素空间生成模型通常比潜在空间模型更难训练且性能较差，存在持续的性能和效率差距。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段预训练编码器捕捉干净图像的语义特征并沿确定性采样轨迹对齐；第二阶段将编码器与随机初始化解码器集成，端到端微调完整模型。

Result: 扩散模型在ImageNet-256上FID达2.04，ImageNet-512上FID达2.35（75 NFE），大幅超越先前像素空间方法；一致性模型在ImageNet-256上单步采样FID达8.82，显著超越潜在空间对应模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个成功在高分辨率图像上直接训练一致性模型的方法，无需依赖预训练VAE或扩散模型，证明了像素空间模型的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，需要大量视觉-文本标注且引入显著推理延迟

Method: IVT-LR将推理步骤表示为潜在文本和潜在视觉的组合，采用渐进式多阶段训练策略

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA上平均准确率提升5.45%，推理速度提升5倍以上

Conclusion: IVT-LR通过潜在推理有效解决了多模态推理中的标注成本和延迟问题

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Method: 基于整流流的框架，将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验直接融入网络训练过程，并引入时间维度建模

Result: 在USOD10K数据集上，S_m指标提升0.072

Conclusion: 该方法有效且优越，代码将在接受后发布

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法能够有效处理真实世界去噪问题，不依赖噪声假设，具有高效的计算性能和优异的去噪效果。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM

*Shelley Zixin Shu,Haozhe Luo,Alexander Poellinger,Mauricio Reyes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出H-EGL框架，结合自监督和人工指导约束来增强注意力对齐，提高医学影像分类的泛化能力，在胸片分类任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在医学影像中容易学习虚假相关性，导致偏见和泛化能力受限。人类-AI注意力对齐可以缓解这些问题，但通常依赖昂贵的人工监督。

Method: 提出混合解释引导学习(H-EGL)框架，结合自监督和人工指导约束。自监督组件利用类别区分性注意力，不依赖限制性先验，提高鲁棒性和灵活性。

Result: 在胸片分类任务中使用Vision Transformer验证，H-EGL优于两种最先进的解释引导学习方法，表现出更好的分类准确率和泛化能力，产生的注意力图与人类专家知识更一致。

Conclusion: H-EGL框架通过结合自监督和人工指导约束，有效提升了医学影像分类的泛化能力和注意力对齐质量，为减少模型偏见提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

TL;DR: IRIS是一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在"与图像一起思考"范式下能力的基准，包含1,204个跨5个领域的视觉任务，显示当前模型在整合视觉和通用工具方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要遵循"关于图像的思考"范式，将图像视为静态输入，而现实场景中用户提供的图像往往不完美，需要主动的图像操作来发现关键视觉线索。

Method: 引入IRIS基准，包含1,204个具有挑战性的开放视觉任务（603个单轮，601个多轮），涵盖五个不同领域，每个任务配有详细评分标准。

Result: 当前MLLMs在需要有效整合视觉和通用工具的任务上表现不佳，最强模型GPT-5-think仅达到18.68%通过率，不同模型在工具使用行为上存在差异。

Conclusion: IRIS作为首个以"与图像一起思考"为中心的基准，为推进MLLMs的视觉智能提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的个性化联邦微调方法，通过正交LoRA适配器分离通用知识和客户端特定知识，使每个客户端能充分利用自身和其他客户端的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在医疗AI中应用时面临数据共享限制和隐私保护问题，联邦学习虽然能解决数据聚合问题，但传统方法难以充分利用各客户端数据。

Method: 使用正交LoRA适配器来解耦通用知识和客户端特定知识，在联邦学习框架下进行个性化微调。

Result: 在真实世界联邦医学影像任务上的初步结果显示，该方法与当前联邦微调方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提出的个性化联邦微调方法能有效解决医疗数据隐私保护和数据利用之间的矛盾，为医疗AI应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

*Junhao Zhuang,Shi Guo,Xin Cai,Xiaohui Li,Yihao Liu,Chun Yuan,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVSR是首个基于扩散模型的一步流式实时视频超分辨率框架，通过三阶段蒸馏、局部稀疏注意力和微型条件解码器实现高效处理，在A100 GPU上达到约17 FPS的768x1408视频处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法存在高延迟、计算量大、对超高分辨率泛化能力差的问题，需要实现效率、可扩展性和实时性能。

Method: 提出三阶段蒸馏管道实现流式超分辨率，使用局部约束稀疏注意力减少冗余计算并弥合训练-测试分辨率差距，采用微型条件解码器加速重建而不牺牲质量。

Result: FlashVSR在超高分辨率下可靠扩展，达到最先进性能，比之前的一步扩散VSR模型快12倍，并构建了包含12万视频和18万图像的大规模数据集VSR-120K。

Conclusion: FlashVSR使基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率变得实用，实现了效率、可扩展性和实时性能，将发布代码、预训练模型和数据集以促进高效扩散VSR研究。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

TL;DR: SPORTS框架通过集成视频全景分割、视觉里程计和场景渲染任务，解决了场景感知中的分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、数据稀疏性和视角限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案在场景感知、理解和模拟方面存在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、传感器数据稀疏性和视角限制等问题，需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 提出SPORTS框架，集成VPS、VO和SR任务：VPS使用自适应注意力几何融合机制对齐跨帧特征；VO结合全景分割和光流图改进动态物体置信度估计；SR利用VO结果将稀疏点云转换为神经场进行渲染。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在里程计、跟踪、分割和新视角合成任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPORTS框架通过任务间的紧密集成和迭代优化，实现了更全面的场景理解，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VQArt-Bench，一个针对文化遗产领域的大规模视觉问答基准测试，通过多智能体管道生成复杂多样的艺术分析问题，评估多模态大语言模型的深度语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准测试主要关注简单句法结构和表面属性，无法评估复杂领域（如视觉艺术分析）的深度语义理解，导致模型倾向于利用统计捷径而非进行真正的视觉推理。

Method: 使用新颖的多智能体管道，让专门化的智能体协作生成经过验证的、语言多样化的复杂问题，构建按相关视觉理解维度组织的基准测试。

Result: 对14个最先进MLLM的评估显示当前模型存在显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的意外弱点，以及专有模型与开源模型之间的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench填补了现有VQA基准在评估深度语义理解方面的空白，揭示了当前MLLM在复杂视觉推理任务中的不足，为未来模型发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为E-MoFlow的无监督框架，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化事件相机的自运动和光流估计，无需地面真值监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将光流和6-DoF自运动估计分开处理，在事件相机中由于缺乏鲁棒的数据关联而成为不适定问题。现有方法要么引入变分正则化导致结果偏差和计算开销，要么通过参数化容易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过归纳偏置嵌入时空一致性；结合微分几何约束引入结构和运动先验，避免显式深度估计但保持几何一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法适用于一般6-DoF运动场景，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至与有监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow框架通过隐式正则化在完全无监督范式下统一了自运动和光流估计，解决了事件相机中的不适定问题。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的头部运动校正方法DL-HMC++，通过交叉注意力机制从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，无需外部硬件跟踪设备，在多种PET扫描仪和放射性示踪剂上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部运动在脑PET成像中造成显著挑战，导致图像伪影和示踪剂摄取定量不准确。硬件运动跟踪在临床实践中适用性有限，需要开发数据驱动的运动校正方法。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制的深度学习模型DL-HMC++，通过监督学习利用现有动态PET扫描和外部硬件运动跟踪的金标准测量数据，从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动。

Result: 在HRRT和mCT两种PET扫描仪及四种放射性示踪剂上评估，DL-HMC++始终优于最先进的数据驱动运动估计方法，产生无运动伪影的图像，与金标准HMT的差异比分别为1.2±0.5%和0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动PET头部运动校正的潜力，可消除对硬件运动跟踪的依赖，使运动校正技术能够在临床环境中广泛应用。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的特征上采样方法（如DINO或CLIP）需要为每个特征提取器重新训练，无法在推理时泛化到不同的特征类型。

Method: 提出了一种推理时特征无关的上采样架构，无需特定编码器训练，可泛化到不同特征类型。

Result: AnyUp在特征上采样方面达到了新的最先进水平，能够泛化到不同特征类型，保持特征语义，且高效易用于各种下游任务。

Conclusion: AnyUp提供了一种通用、高效的特征上采样解决方案，突破了现有方法对特定编码器的依赖限制。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 本文为高效感知超分辨率建立了现代基准，展示了在严格效率约束下实现优越感知质量的可能性。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

Method: 使用Flow Poke Transformer框架，基于稀疏交互直接预测局部运动分布，提供可解释的运动表示。

Result: 在密集面部运动生成任务中，通用预训练模型超越专门基线；在强分布外任务中，经过微调后在关节物体运动估计上显著优于域内方法；在基于交互的移动部件分割任务中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: FPT框架能够直接预测显式运动分布，提供灵活且可解释的场景动态建模方法，在多个任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型存在理解能力与生成能力不匹配的问题，模型能正确理解图像却无法从文本提示生成准确的图像。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新范式，使统一多模态模型能够通过自奖励机制，利用理解模块来指导和增强自身的生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

TL;DR: UniFusion是一个基于扩散的生成模型，使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型(VLM)作为统一的多模态编码器，通过Layerwise Attention Pooling(LAP)机制提取多层级特征，并结合VERIFI方法实现推理时的灵活性和能力提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成架构通常使用独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了跨模态推理和知识迁移能力。现有统一模型方法需要大量计算资源和数据，限制了可访问性。

Method: 1. 使用冻结的VLM作为统一多模态编码器；2. 提出Layerwise Attention Pooling(LAP)机制提取高低层级特征；3. 提出VERIFI方法，在推理时仅使用VLM生成的文本token进行条件生成。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构，能够忠实传递VLM的视觉信息到扩散模型。在编辑任务上微调不仅改善了生成的对齐度，还展现出强大的泛化能力，能够零样本泛化到多图像参考。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计证明了跨模态知识迁移的有效性，为构建更高效的生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ViCO方法，通过视觉一致性学习让多模态大语言模型根据图像语义复杂度自适应调整视觉token数量，减少50%推理成本同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs因图像输入引入额外视觉token导致推理成本增加，需要更高效的视觉表示方法。

Method: 使用多个不同压缩率的MLP连接器对视觉token进行下采样，训练时最小化不同连接器响应的KL散度，推理时通过ViR路由器自动选择合适压缩率。

Result: 实验证明该方法可减少50%视觉token，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力。

Conclusion: ViCO方法为开发更高效的MLLMs提供了有效途径，代码和模型将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay是一个可微分的向量化层，将立方多参数持续性（CMP）集成到深度学习流程中，通过分解CMP为可学习的单参数持续性，为图像分析提供稳健的拓扑特征向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP是处理图像拓扑结构的强大方法，但由于多滤过结构的复杂性和CMP向量化的困难，其应用受到限制。CuMPerLay旨在克服这些挑战，将全局结构信息整合到深度网络中。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方复形的多参数同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持续性组合，联合学习双滤过函数，具有可微性，可与Swin Transformer等先进架构无缝集成。

Result: 在基准医学成像和计算机视觉数据集上的实验表明，CuMPerLay在分类和分割性能上带来益处，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为将全局结构信息整合到深度网络中提供了有前景的方向，适用于结构化图像分析。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0通过世界建模预测未来图像来解决视觉-语言-动作模型的监督不足问题，显著提升驾驶智能性能，并在大规模数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作模型存在监督不足问题，模型的大容量仅由稀疏的低维动作监督，导致其表示能力未被充分利用。

Method: 提出DriveVLA-W0训练范式，使用世界建模预测未来图像，为两种主要VLA架构（离散视觉token的自回归模型和连续视觉特征的扩散模型）提供密集的自监督信号，并引入轻量级动作专家解决实时部署的推理延迟。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2基准测试和680倍更大的内部数据集上，DriveVLA-W0显著优于BEV和VLA基线模型，并放大了数据缩放定律，显示随着训练数据集增大，性能提升加速。

Conclusion: 世界建模是解决VLA模型监督不足的有效方法，能够学习驾驶环境的底层动态，显著提升模型性能和数据效率。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

TL;DR: Rex-Omni是一个3B规模的MLLM，通过特殊token表示量化坐标、多数据引擎生成高质量训练数据、以及两阶段训练流程，在零样本设置下实现了与回归模型相当的目标检测性能，并具备多种视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统坐标回归模型主导目标检测，但现有MLLM方法面临召回率低、重复预测、坐标不对齐等问题，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 1) 使用特殊token表示0-999的量化坐标；2) 构建多个数据引擎生成高质量定位、指代和指向数据；3) 采用两阶段训练：2200万数据的监督微调 + 基于GRPO的强化学习后训练。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS基准测试中，Rex-Omni在零样本设置下达到或超过回归模型（如DINO、Grounding DINO）的性能。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统铺平了道路，展示了MLLM在目标检测领域的潜力。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在流程僵化、搜索调用过多、查询构建不佳等问题，导致效率低下和结果不理想。需要让MLLM能够访问外部知识源并响应动态变化的现实世界信息。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。创建了DeepMMSearchVQA数据集，包含多样化的多跳查询，教导模型何时搜索、搜索什么、使用哪个搜索工具以及如何推理检索到的信息。

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的优越性。模型能够基于输入图像的相关裁剪启动网络搜索，并迭代调整文本搜索查询。

Conclusion: 该方法为推进多模态网络搜索提供了有价值的见解，能够实现自我反思和自我修正，显著提升了搜索效率和结果质量。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

Motivation: 当前VR中的3D内容物理操纵技术存在工程密集、几何表示简化等问题，影响了视觉保真度和物理准确性。需要更直观高效的交互方法。

Method: 将物体的网格与高斯溅射表示直接集成，实现更精确的表面近似，支持物理引擎无关的部署，利用现有3D网格资产简化工作流程。

Result: 在18名参与者的对比研究中，该方法在物理感知拉伸操作上显著优于现有技术，在扭曲和摇晃等其他物理操作中也表现更一致。

Conclusion: G-SVERSE提供了一种高度逼真、适应性强且直观的交互式3D操纵方法，有潜力成为现有方法的可行替代方案。

Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and
efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for
physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face
significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes
and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can
compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce
\our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual
\textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a
novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an
object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach
enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic
deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{}
facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow.
Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting
developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers
a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D
manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current
state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study
involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is
statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation
and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting
and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms
that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing
its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

*Ty Trusty*

TL;DR: 提出Coordinate Condensation方法，通过结合局部坐标更新和基于Schur补的子空间修正来加速物理仿真，相比标准坐标下降和JGS2方法收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如JGS2使用扰动子空间来考虑全局耦合，但会引入阻尼从而降低收敛速度。需要一种既能保持坐标下降效率又能避免阻尼影响的方法。

Method: 重用子空间但独立求解局部和子空间位移，消除阻尼效应。通过Schur补子空间修正来增强局部坐标更新。

Result: 在子空间能充分捕捉全局耦合的情况下，该方法实现了接近牛顿法的收敛速度，同时保持了坐标下降的效率和并行性。在不同材料刚度和网格分辨率下的实验显示收敛速度显著优于标准坐标下降和JGS2。

Conclusion: 该方法在适当条件下能实现高效收敛，并分析了子空间坐标方法成功或失败的条件，为未来求解器设计提供了见解。

Abstract: We introduce Coordinate Condensation, a variant of coordinate descent that
accelerates physics-based simulation by augmenting local coordinate updates
with a Schur-complement-based subspace correction. Recent work by Lan et al.
2025 (JGS2) uses perturbation subspaces to augment local solves to account for
global coupling, but their approach introduces damping that can degrade
convergence. We reuse this subspace but solve for local and subspace
displacements independently, eliminating this damping. For problems where the
subspace adequately captures global coupling, our method achieves near-Newton
convergence while retaining the efficiency and parallelism of coordinate
descent. Through experiments across varying material stiffnesses and mesh
resolutions, we show substantially faster convergence than both standard
coordinate descent and JGS2. We also characterize when subspace-based
coordinate methods succeed or fail, offering insights for future solver design.

Result: 在零样本和少样本场景下相比现有方法有显著改进

Conclusion: 保持表征间隙作为几何必要性对于维护模态特定知识和提升迁移性能至关重要

Abstract: Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates
structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in
diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to
maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and
text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical
analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction
result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge
structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric
incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological
patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment
compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure
collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding.
We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves
representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific
knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap
preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity
evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative
power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show
significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios.

Conclusion: 多级草图表示方案能够系统识别草图中的有效信息，SDGraph架构能够有效利用这些信息，在多个草图相关下游任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Freehand sketches exhibit unique sparsity and abstraction, necessitating
learning pipelines distinct from those designed for images. For sketch learning
methods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information
embedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes
effective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of
existing approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level
Sketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective
information. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels:
sketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the
granularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine
(point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch
information. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental
evaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the
above studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to
exploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph
comprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as
nodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense
Graph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level
representation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with
down-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both
encoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two
graphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of
sketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\% and
1.70\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively,
and 36.58\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality.

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效解决LLM评估器的正向偏见问题，显著提高评估准确性，为模型选择提供了更可靠的自动化评估方案。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

*Owen Queen,Harrison G. Zhang,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGBench是一个用于评估语言模型在科学文献解释能力的基准测试，基于临床遗传学专家标注数据构建，测试模型在实验数据提取、证据强度判断和实验结果分类方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因和变异解释方法耗时且人工密集，需要自动化工具来加速临床转化研究。现有基准测试任务狭窄，无法反映真实研究需求。

Method: 基于ClinGen专家标注的临床遗传学文献构建CGBench基准，测试8种不同语言模型在三个关键任务上的表现：精确提取实验结果、判断证据强度、分类和描述实验结果。

Result: 模型在文献解释方面显示潜力但存在显著差距，推理模型在细粒度任务上表现更好，非推理模型在高层次解释上更优。模型常产生幻觉或误解结果，即使正确分类证据。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在科学文献精确解释方面的优缺点，为AI在临床遗传学和更广泛科学领域的未来研究开辟了道路。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型思想的两阶段训练方法，让LLM学会通过顺序提问来有效挖掘用户偏好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用户历史数据有限的情况下，如何通过生成有效的顺序澄清问题来获取用户偏好信息，以个性化LLM推荐系统的响应

Method: 采用两阶段训练过程：前向过程从用户档案生成澄清问题并逐步移除答案（添加"噪声"），反向过程训练模型通过提问来"去噪"用户档案

Result: 该方法显著提高了LLM提出漏斗式问题和有效获取用户偏好的能力

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的训练方法能够有效训练LLM生成顺序澄清问题，从而更好地挖掘用户偏好

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造环境需要准确预测和可解释的异常分析，现有AI系统作为孤立黑箱缺乏预测、解释和因果推理的集成，限制了在高风险工业环境中的可信度和实用性。

Method: 开发CausalTrace神经符号因果分析模块，集成到SmartPilot工业CoPilot中，利用数据驱动的因果分析结合工业本体和知识图谱，支持因果发现、反事实推理和根本原因分析。

Result: 在学术火箭装配测试中，CausalTrace与领域专家达成高度一致（ROUGE-1: 0.91），RCA性能强劲（MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92），C3AN评估得分4.59/5。

Conclusion: CausalTrace通过神经符号因果分析提供了透明、可解释的决策支持，在工业环境中表现出高精度和可靠性，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

TL;DR: PACT是一个评估LLM生成代码合同遵从性的框架，扩展了HumanEval+和MBPP+基准，通过合同违反测试用例增强模型对合同约束的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准主要评估功能正确性，但忽略了真实软件中合同约束的重要性，导致无法衡量模型生成代码的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: 提供专注于合同违反的测试套件语料库，系统分析不同提示条件下的代码生成，并引入新的指标来量化合同遵从性。

Result: 研究表明，在提示中增加合同违反测试用例相比仅使用合同描述能显著提升模型对合同的遵从能力。

Conclusion: PACT通过揭示传统基准忽略的关键错误，为评估LLM生成代码的功能性和合同遵从性提供了严格且可解释的指标。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

TL;DR: 提出了一种地理感知层(GAL)，通过整合地理数据来增强LLM在灾害响应中的能力，使其能够基于结构化地球数据生成基于证据的资源分配建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义上下文、跨事件泛化能力差且可解释性有限，而LLM虽然具有少量样本泛化能力，但受限于文本且对地理信息不敏感。

Method: 开发了地理感知层(GAL)，从原始野火检测开始，自动检索并整合基础设施、人口统计、地形和天气信息，构建带单位注释的感知脚本。

Result: 在真实野火场景中评估表明，地理接地的智能体能够超越基线方法，该框架可泛化到洪水、飓风等其他灾害。

Conclusion: 地理感知层成功地将LLM智能体与结构化地球数据相结合，显著提升了灾害响应中资源分配建议的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkPilot是一个无需训练即可自动优化大型推理模型推理过程的框架，通过进化过程生成think-prefixes指令来引导模型获得更好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然强大，但仍存在推理效率低下和目标偏离的问题。现有的无需训练方法要么局限于僵化的启发式规则，要么只能提供描述性但不可操作的分析。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes，这些指令在推理行为分类学的驱动下演化，引导模型朝着更优性能方向发展。

Result: ThinkPilot显著改善了准确率与推理长度的权衡关系，大幅提升了安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），并增强了指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能够可靠地控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好。通过自动识别和激发这些行为，ThinkPilot提供了一个可泛化的框架来使模型推理与任务需求对齐。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

*Alessandro Achille,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文重新诠释了AI智能体中的学习角色，将其视为具有计算能力的随机动力系统，并强调时间在学习推理中的基础作用。论文提出从归纳学习转向转导学习，认为信息的关键作用是减少时间而非降低重构误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI推理智能体是否具有通用性，能否解决任何可计算任务，以及智能体如何学习推理。质疑模型规模或训练数据规模是否是关键因素，强调时间在学习过程中的重要作用。

Method: 将AI智能体重新解释为具有计算能力的随机动力系统，提出转导学习框架，其中目标不是近似过去数据的分布，而是捕捉其算法结构以减少解决新任务所需的时间。

Result: 证明了通用求解器使用过去数据所能达到的最优加速与其算法信息紧密相关，推导出推理时间与训练时间之间观察到的幂律缩放关系。发现单纯扩大模型规模可能导致智能体像白痴学者一样，能够暴力解决任务但缺乏洞察力。

Conclusion: 在扩展推理模型时，应该优化的关键量是时间而非模型规模。时间在学习中的关键作用迄今仅被间接考虑，应该成为优化推理模型的核心指标。

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

TL;DR: HiCoTraj是一个基于大语言模型的零样本人口统计推理框架，通过层次化思维链提示从轨迹数据中推断年龄、性别、收入等人口属性，无需标注训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于移动轨迹的人口统计推断方法严重依赖带标签的大规模轨迹数据，导致可解释性差、跨数据集和用户群体的泛化能力弱。

Method: 将轨迹转换为语义丰富的自然语言表示，创建详细活动记录和多尺度访问摘要，然后通过层次化思维链推理（事实特征提取、行为模式分析、结构化输出的人口统计推断）系统引导LLMs。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验评估表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景下对多个人口统计属性实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj解决了标注人口统计数据稀缺的问题，同时提供了透明的推理链，在无需训练数据的情况下实现了有效的人口统计推断。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Result: EmboBrain-7B在两个具身决策基准上比671B的DeepSeek-R1高出9.5%。

Conclusion: 交互式、环境基础的学习对于构建真正智能的具身智能体具有强大效果。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注轨迹级分析，但在大规模数据集中检测个体相对于自身历史模式的异常行为仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: BeSTAD学习语义丰富的移动表示，整合位置含义和时间模式，并采用行为聚类感知建模机制，通过跨时期行为比较和一致的语义对齐来识别异常。

Conclusion: 通过直接从无标签数据中学习个体行为，BeSTAD将异常检测推向个性化和可解释的移动分析。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

Motivation: 随着LLM技术的快速发展，许多应用需要随机性，但LLM处理随机性的能力尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑外部工具访问、任务类型、模型状态和提示策略等因素，涵盖生成随机数、随机字符串、洗牌和随机性质量评估等任务。

Result: LLM能生成具有一定随机性的输出，但性能不一致，且与预期行为存在显著偏差。

Conclusion: LLM在处理涉及随机性的任务时存在关键局限性，需要改进才能有效处理此类任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Motivation: 解决在复杂、随机环境中，智能体只有"一次生命"来探索敌对环境且无人指导的现实挑战性场景下的符号世界建模问题。

Method: 使用条件激活的程序化法则，每个法则通过前提-效果结构在相关世界状态中激活，创建动态计算图，仅在相关法则上进行推理和优化，避免复杂层次状态预测时的扩展挑战。

Result: 在Crafter-OO环境中，OneLife从最少无指导交互中成功学习关键环境动态，在23个测试场景中的16个优于强基线，模拟推演成功识别出更优策略。

Conclusion: 为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种精确控制LLM输出属性强度的方法，通过目标达成问题重新定义、训练轻量级价值函数和基于梯度的隐层表示干预，实现细粒度连续控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法只能提供方向性或开放式指导，无法可靠实现精确的属性强度控制，这限制了AI系统适应多样化用户期望的能力。

Method: 1) 将精确属性强度控制重新定义为目标达成问题；2) 通过时序差分学习训练轻量级价值函数预测属性强度；3) 使用基于梯度的隐层表示干预精确导航模型。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2-3b和Phi-4-mini上的实验证实该方法能高精度地将文本生成引导至用户指定的属性强度。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了超越简单方向对齐的细粒度连续控制，并在偏好数据合成、帕累托前沿近似优化和对齐行为蒸馏三个下游任务中展示了效率提升。

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MatSciBench是一个包含1,340个大学水平材料科学问题的综合基准测试，涵盖6个主要领域和31个子领域，具有三级难度分类和多模态推理能力。评估显示即使是表现最佳的模型在材料科学问题上准确率也不到80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学推理方面表现出色，但在材料科学领域的推理能力尚未得到充分探索，需要建立一个全面的基准来评估和推动LLMs在该领域的发展。

Method: 构建MatSciBench基准，包含1,340个结构化问题，采用精细分类系统和三级难度分类，并整合多模态推理。评估不同推理策略（基础思维链、工具增强、自我纠正）在领先模型上的表现。

Result: 即使是表现最佳的Gemini-2.5-Pro模型在材料科学问题上的准确率也不到80%。不同推理策略在不同场景下表现各异，没有单一方法在所有情况下都表现优异。多模态推理任务面临挑战，检索增强生成的影响需要进一步评估。

Conclusion: MatSciBench为评估和提升LLMs在材料科学领域的科学推理能力建立了一个全面而坚实的基准，揭示了当前模型在该领域的局限性，并为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time
human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design.
A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live
''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file
change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the
run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching
smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In
fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文对65个评估可解释AI(XAI)系统的用户研究进行了全面综述，提出了以人为中心的XAI系统设计目标和评估框架，并根据用户AI专业水平(新手和专家)进行了差异化设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，对既高性能又可理解的智能系统需求日益增长。当前XAI系统的评估过程过于技术化，未能充分关注人类用户的需求，需要建立以人为中心的评估框架。

Method: 通过对65个XAI用户研究的全面综述，分析XAI系统特性和评估指标，提出以人为中心的设计目标，并根据用户AI专业水平进行差异化设计。

Result: 发现XAI系统由核心系统和解释组件构成；评估指标可分为情感、认知、可用性、可解释性和解释指标；针对AI新手强调负责任使用、接受度和可用性，针对数据专家强调性能导向、人机协作和任务表现。

Conclusion: 提出了扩展的XAI评估和设计框架，强调根据用户专业水平差异化设计，为XAI开发者提供了以人为中心的系统设计和评估指南。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

TL;DR: GOAT是一个无需人工标注的训练框架，能够从API文档自动构建合成数据集，用于微调LLM代理处理目标导向的API执行任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理需要分解高级目标为多个相互依赖API调用的目标导向查询时能力有限，开源模型表现不佳，缺乏训练数据。

Method: 提出GOAT框架，从API文档自动构建合成数据集，训练LLM代理进行推理和生成连贯响应。

Result: GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在新基准GOATBench上也表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT为构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的强大开源LLM代理提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

TL;DR: MedKGEval是一个基于结构化医学知识的多轮临床LLM评估框架，通过知识图谱驱动的患者模拟和实时评估机制，解决了传统医学对话评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型医学评估方法主要依赖事后对话转录分析，忽略了医学对话的动态性和上下文敏感性，无法捕捉真实临床环境中医生-患者多轮互动的复杂性。

Method: 1. 知识图谱驱动的患者模拟机制，从精心构建的知识图谱中检索相关医学事实；2. 实时轮级评估框架，通过法官代理评估每个模型响应的临床适当性、事实准确性和安全性；3. 构建多轮基准测试，评估8个最先进的LLM。

Conclusion: 该框架为医学LLM评估提供了更准确、动态的解决方案，支持中英文应用，并可轻松扩展到其他语言，具有良好的领域适用性和双语支持能力。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了PromptFlow框架，通过模块化设计和元学习自动优化提示工程，减少人工干预并提升LLM在特定领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在特定领域部署时手动提示设计效率低、依赖专家知识的问题，以及现有自动提示工程方法缺乏动态策略选择和细粒度编辑能力。

Method: 提出PromptFlow模块化训练框架，包含元提示、操作符、优化器和评估器，采用基于梯度的元学习和强化学习来回收经验，自动探索最优提示优化路径。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了PromptFlow的有效性，能够以最少任务特定训练数据实现高性能。

Conclusion: PromptFlow为自动提示工程提供了灵活高效的解决方案，通过模块化设计和经验回收机制显著提升了LLM在特定任务上的适应能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在主动推理中容易发生信念偏差，导致失去问题状态跟踪、陷入无效重复行为，且强化学习无法正确归因关键探索步骤。

Method: 提出T³方法，通过追踪模型信念偏差，在训练中检测过度的信念偏差并截断轨迹，保留信息丰富的前缀部分以改善策略优化。

Result: 在5个挑战性任务中，T³显著提升训练稳定性、token效率和最终性能，最高获得30%性能增益，同时减少约25%的token使用量。

Conclusion: 信念控制是开发鲁棒和可泛化LLM主动推理器的关键原则，T³方法通过简单有效的信念偏差管理实现了系统性改进。

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI工具如PyTorch缺乏自动推理支持，而AI语言如LISP缺乏可扩展性，需要统一神经和符号AI的基础语言。

Method: 基于张量方程构建张量逻辑语言，将逻辑规则与爱因斯坦求和视为相同操作，并以此实现各种AI形式。

Result: 成功实现变换器、形式推理、核机器和图模型等关键AI形式，支持嵌入空间中的可靠推理。

Conclusion: 张量逻辑结合了神经网络的可扩展性和符号推理的可靠性，为AI的广泛应用提供了基础。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

Motivation: 现实世界中的知识库本质上是多模态的，包含丰富的文本、视觉元素、结构化表格和数学表达式组合。但现有的RAG框架仅限于文本内容，在处理多模态文档时存在根本性差距。

Method: 将多模态内容重新概念化为相互连接的知识实体，而非孤立的数据类型。引入双图构建来捕获跨模态关系和文本语义的统一表示。开发了结合结构知识导航和语义匹配的跨模态混合检索方法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中表现出优越性能，相比最先进方法取得显著改进。在处理长文档时性能提升尤为明显，传统方法在此类任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态知识访问建立了新范式，消除了当前系统的架构碎片化限制，实现了跨所有模态的全面知识检索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在数学研究中验证困难的问题，证明虽然看起来合理但无法信任，需要严格的检查机制。

Method: 使用LLM+CAS框架，通过符号反馈循环：LLM建议域分解，CAS（如Mathematica）对每个部分进行公理化验证。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架展示了AI如何超越竞赛数学，成为专业数学家的研究级工具，推动了AI在数学研究中的应用。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次系统综述了基于大语言模型的Vibe Coding范式，通过分析1000多篇论文建立了理论框架和实践分类，揭示了成功Vibe Coding依赖于系统上下文工程、完善开发环境和人机协作模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，从代码生成辅助转向自主编码代理，催生了"Vibe Coding"新开发方法，但该范式的有效性尚未充分探索，实证研究显示存在生产力损失和人机协作挑战。

Method: 通过系统分析1000多篇研究论文，建立约束马尔可夫决策过程理论框架，将现有实践综合为五种开发模型：无约束自动化、迭代对话协作、规划驱动、测试驱动和上下文增强模型。

Result: 成功Vibe Coding不仅依赖代理能力，更关键的是系统上下文工程、完善开发环境和人机协作开发模型，提供了该领域的首个全面分类法。

Conclusion: Vibe Coding作为正式学科需要理论框架支撑，成功的实施需要综合考虑代理能力、上下文工程和协作模型的系统性方法。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

*Yunuo Liu,Dawei Zhu,Zena Al-Khalili,Dai Cheng,Yanjun Chen,Dietrich Klakow,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PricingLogic是首个评估大语言模型在旅游定价场景中可靠性的基准测试，包含300个基于真实定价政策的问题，测试模型在多规则重叠情况下的定价能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望将易出错的定价任务自动化给AI系统，但未经验证可靠性的LLM部署可能导致重大财务损失和客户信任危机。

Method: 构建包含300个自然语言问题的基准数据集，基于42个真实定价政策，分为两个难度级别：基础客户类型定价和涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算。

Result: 对一系列LLM的评估显示，在较难层级上性能急剧下降，暴露出规则解释和算术推理的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管具备通用能力，当前LLM在收入关键应用中仍不可靠，需要进一步的安全保障或领域适应。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

*Dingyi Zuo,Hongjie Zhang,Jie Ou,Chaosheng Feng,Shuwan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MTOS框架，将多主题环境与LLMs结合，模拟社交网络中的意见演化，通过实验发现多主题设置显著改变极化趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有研究主要关注单一主题，无法捕捉多主题、跨领域认知转移的问题，以及传统数值模型缺乏解释性和行为一致性的局限。

Method: 提出MTOS框架，整合LLMs与短期和长期记忆，采用多种用户选择交互机制和动态主题选择策略，并引入信念衰减机制实现跨主题视角更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回音室效应，负相关主题抑制回音室，无关主题通过资源竞争也缓解回音室效应。

Conclusion: 相比数值模型，基于LLM的智能体能更真实地模拟动态意见变化，再现新闻文本的语言特征，捕捉复杂的人类推理，提高模拟可解释性和系统稳定性。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口自动驾驶决策面临复杂动态交互和高冲突风险的挑战，需要实现主动安全控制。

Method: 基于Soft Actor-Critic算法，使用偏置注意力机制构建交通风险评估器，评估车辆进入交叉口的长期碰撞风险，并将其转化为密集奖励信号指导决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明该方法有效提高了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 所提出的智能决策框架在复杂场景中具有有效性，能够实现安全高效的自动驾驶决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

*Jiaxin Gao,Chen Chen,Yanwen Jia,Xueluan Gong,Kwok-Yan Lam,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统研究LLM作为评估者时的判断偏见，涵盖11种偏见类型，发现现有LLM评估者对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，但微调于偏见数据会显著降低性能，并提出四种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在通信系统中被用于自主评估内容质量，其评估的公正性至关重要。任何偏见都可能扭曲结果并损害用户信任，因此需要系统研究LLM评估者的偏见问题。

Method: 在点式评分设置下，系统调查两种LLM评估模型（GPT-Judge和JudgeLM）的11种偏见类型，包括隐式和显式偏见形式，并分析偏见输入、评分标准、微调数据和任务难度对评估的影响。

Result: 发现最先进的LLM评估者对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，通常给偏见样本分配较低分数；提供详细评分标准能增强鲁棒性；在偏见数据上微调会显著降低性能；评估分数与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: LLM评估者存在判断偏见风险，但通过适当措施（如详细评分标准）可提高鲁棒性。需要警惕在偏见数据上训练的风险，并提出了四种确保AI评估公平可靠的缓解策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于有向无环图的面向任务医疗对话框架，包含问题转换、冷启动、自适应分支、终止逻辑和报告生成等功能，在初步评估中表现出良好的用户体验和临床工作流程集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗对话系统中缺乏结构化、自适应和临床工作流程集成的问题，提高医患交互效率。

Method: 采用有向无环图结构，集成系统化问题转换、分层聚类冷启动、扩展剪枝自适应分支、终止逻辑和自动化报告生成机制。

Result: 患者应用：低认知负荷(15.6)、高可用性(86)、强满意度(8.1/9)；医生应用：中等认知负荷(26)、优异可用性(88.5)、高满意度(8.3/9)。

Conclusion: 该框架有效降低了认知需求，支持高效报告生成，成功集成到临床工作流程中，但存在系统延迟和样本多样性不足的局限性。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模型无关的细胞状态潜在(CSL)视角，通过操作符语法组织学习过程，强调决策对齐的评估框架，以解决当前AI虚拟细胞模型在跨实验室、跨平台迁移性以及跨尺度耦合方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI虚拟细胞模型虽然在单细胞和空间基础模型方面取得进展，但在跨实验室和平台的可迁移性、数据泄露和覆盖偏差、剂量时间组合效应处理等方面存在局限，跨尺度耦合也受到限制。

Method: 提出模型无关的CSL视角，通过操作符语法(测量、提升/投影用于跨尺度耦合、干预用于剂量和调度)组织学习，强调决策对齐的评估蓝图。

Result: 提出了操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄露分区以及透明校准和报告的建议，以实现可重复的同类比较。

Conclusion: CSL视角和操作符语法框架能够促进AI虚拟细胞模型的跨模态、跨尺度、跨上下文和跨干预的决策对齐评估，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProtoSiTex是一个用于细粒度多标签文本分类的半可解释框架，通过双阶段交替训练策略学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，并使用分层损失函数确保子句、句子和文档级别的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户生成评论的激增需要可解释模型提供细粒度洞察。现有基于原型的模型通常在粗粒度（句子或文档级别）操作，无法处理现实世界文本分类的多标签性质。

Method: 采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。使用分层损失函数和自适应原型、多头注意力机制。

Result: 在酒店评论基准数据集和两个公共基准测试（二分类和多分类）上的实验表明，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，同时提供忠实、与人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex为半可解释多标签文本分类提供了一个强大的解决方案，能够捕捉重叠和冲突的语义，同时保持高可解释性。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自然选择和生物进化启发，旨在通过基因共享和包容性适应度奖励，在智能体间产生更复杂的社交动态，超越传统二元团队结构。

Method: 为每个智能体分配基因型，基于遗传相似性设计包容性适应度奖励函数，在囚徒困境网络游戏中研究社交动态。

Result: 实验结果符合生物学原理（如汉密尔顿法则），能够产生从完全对抗到完全合作的连续合作谱系，以及独特的非团队社交关系。

Conclusion: 基于包容性适应度的奖励机制为更复杂社交智能体的涌现提供了基础，能够模拟生物进化中的策略军备竞赛和多智能体自课程学习。

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了HardcoreLogic基准测试，包含5000多个谜题，通过增加复杂性、非常规元素和不可解谜题三个维度来测试大型推理模型的鲁棒性，发现现有模型严重依赖记忆模式而非真正推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但面对非标准游戏变体时能否灵活应用规则仍存疑问。现有语料库主要关注标准格式（如9x9数独），容易导致模型过拟合和记忆解决方案模式，掩盖了理解新规则和适应新变体的缺陷。

Method: 构建HardcoreLogic基准测试，包含10个游戏的5000多个谜题，通过三个维度系统化转换标准谜题：增加复杂性(IC)、非常规元素(UE)和不可解谜题(UP)，减少对捷径记忆的依赖。

Result: 评估显示各种大型推理模型性能显著下降，即使在现有基准测试中表现最佳的模型也出现大幅性能下降，表明它们严重依赖记忆的刻板模式。增加复杂性是主要困难来源，但模型在细微规则变化上也表现不佳。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic揭示了当前大型推理模型的局限性，为推进高级逻辑推理建立了基准测试，表明现有模型缺乏真正的推理能力，过度依赖记忆模式。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Conclusion: 将工作内存管理作为可学习的内部能力，通过强化学习联合优化，能够有效解决LLM在长视野任务中的内存限制问题，提高任务性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Conclusion: ERA为可扩展的具身智能提供了实用路径，为未来具身AI系统提供了方法论见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

Conclusion: 辩论过程能放大正确性，多智能体协作框架为LLM自动判断任务提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mattia Grasselli,Angelo Porrello,Carlo Augusto Grazia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了利用车辆间通信数据（CAM）进行车辆轨迹预测的方法，开发了CAMNet神经网络模型，并在真实CAM数据集上验证了该方法的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶面临安全挑战，现有传感器存在视野受限和遮挡问题。车辆间通信（V2V）能够共享信息，提高情境感知能力，特别是在传感器被遮挡时。

Method: 设计了基于合作感知消息的图神经网络（CAMNet），在广泛使用的运动预测数据集上进行训练，并在专门创建的CAM数据集上进行评估。

Result: 方法显示出有希望的结果，证明CAM数据确实可以支持车辆轨迹预测，但同时也发现了方法的若干局限性。

Conclusion: CAM数据可用于车辆轨迹预测，为未来研究提供了机会，但需要解决当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶、医疗等安全关键系统中，AI系统需要具备在OOD样本、对抗攻击和环境变化下保持可靠性能的鲁棒性。

Method: 结合自监督学习和图论技术，从无标签数据中学习有用表示，实现更高效的OOD样本识别和分类。

Result: 与现有最先进方法相比，该方法在AUROC指标上达到0.99的优异性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了AI系统在无标签数据情况下的OOD检测能力，增强了系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

TL;DR: CLUTCH是一种新颖的深度组合多臂老虎机方法，用于JavaScript引擎模糊测试，通过注意力机制和具体Dropout技术提高变异目标选择的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JavaScript模糊测试方法使用随机选择来确定变异位置，效率不高。作者认为变异目标选择问题适合使用具有可变臂数的组合多臂老虎机来解决。

Method: 提出CLUTCH方法，使用注意力机制处理可变长度的JavaScript测试用例表示，并通过具体Dropout技术动态调整探索策略。

Result: 与三种最先进解决方案相比，CLUTCH将有效测试用例数量和每个测试用例的覆盖率分别平均提高了20.3%和8.9%。在可变和组合设置中，CLUTCH的遗憾分别减少了至少78.1%和4.1%。

Conclusion: CLUTCH在JavaScript模糊测试中显著提高了效率，在可变和组合设置中优于现有最先进的多臂老虎机方法。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec是一种允许用户通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统的方法，通过LLM模拟用户对物品的批准判断，训练嵌入模型来近似这些判断，并将其集成到传统推荐系统的信号权重中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户对推荐系统不满意时缺乏细粒度控制，需要一种通过自然语言请求来指导推荐的方法。

Method: 训练时使用LLM模拟用户基于语言请求对物品的批准判断，训练嵌入模型近似这些判断；部署时只需对每个用户请求进行一次LLM嵌入计算，实现实时推荐控制。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集实验中，该方法在多样化请求下实现了细粒度控制；在19名Letterboxd用户研究中，用户对CTRL-Rec评价积极，相比传统控制显著提升了用户的控制感和满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec成功实现了通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统，显著提升了用户体验和控制感。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

Motivation: 解决科学问题需要结合创造性推理和严格的形式化验证，现有专门化证明器难以泛化到不同领域。Ax-Prover旨在开发一个通用性强、能够跨领域工作的定理证明系统。

Method: 将大型语言模型与Lean定理证明工具通过模型上下文协议集成，构建多智能体系统，结合LLM的知识推理能力和Lean的形式化验证能力。

Result: 在公开数学基准测试中与最先进证明器竞争，在新引入的抽象代数和量子理论基准测试中显著优于现有方法，并成功协助专家数学家形式化复杂密码学定理证明。

Conclusion: 基于工具的智能体定理证明方法为跨领域形式化验证提供了可泛化的方法论，相比专门化系统具有更好的通用性。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor是一个用于ICU死亡率预测的框架，通过原型学习实现内在可解释性，同时整合临床病程识别、人口统计学异质性和预后意识三个关键决策要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，还需要可解释性来建立临床信任和满足监管要求。现有方法主要关注人口统计学异质性，忽视了临床病程识别和预后意识。

Method: ProtoDoctor包含两个关键创新模块：预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习和新型正则化机制实现临床病程识别和预后意识）和人口统计学异质性识别模块（通过队列特异性原型和风险调整建模人口统计学异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明ProtoDoctor在预测准确性上优于最先进的基线方法。人工评估进一步证实其解释在临床上更有意义、更可信且在ICU实践中更适用。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功地将ICU决策实践中的三个关键要素整合到其推理过程中，既提高了预测准确性，又提供了临床上有意义的解释，为ICU死亡率预测提供了理想的解决方案。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

TL;DR: GraphShaper是一个几何感知的图基础模型框架，通过多几何专业化解决现有方法在结构边界处的性能下降问题，在零样本设置下显著提升了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基础模型假设所有图结构都可以在单一欧几里得空间中编码，但实际上树结构需要双曲几何来保持层次分支，循环模式依赖球面几何来保持闭合性。在结构边界处，节点面临冲突的几何约束，导致性能显著下降（超过20个百分点）。

Method: GraphShaper采用多几何专业化方法，使用针对不同几何空间的专家网络，动态计算融合权重，根据局部结构特征自适应地整合几何属性，在文本嵌入对齐前保持结构完整性。

Result: 在零样本设置下，GraphShaper在引文网络上实现了9.47%的准确率提升，在社交网络上实现了7.63%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: GraphShaper证明了通过尊重图结构内在几何多样性的对齐框架设计，可以有效解决结构边界处的性能退化问题，显著提升图基础模型的跨域表示能力。

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定问题集进行在线强化学习或专家迭代，导致训练效率低下且难以处理复杂问题

Method: GAR框架包含问题生成器和求解器，在对抗循环中联合训练，通过隐式课程学习机制使任务难度与证明器能力同步发展

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上平均相对提升4.20%，ProofNet-Test上pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%

Conclusion: GAR不仅提升了定理证明性能，还建立了可验证环境下问题生成与求解协同进化的一般强化学习范式

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本属性图方法在需要细粒度模式识别的任务上表现不佳，特别是在异配图上。通过实证和理论分析发现存在过抽象问题：当前方法在过大的双曲半径下操作，将多尺度结构信息压缩成统一的高层抽象，导致关键局部模式丢失。

Method: 提出H4G框架，使用可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法系统性地减小嵌入半径，在保持全局感知能力的同时恢复对细粒度模式的访问，计算开销最小。

Result: H4G在零样本性能上达到最先进水平，在异配图上提升12.8%，在同配图上提升8.4%，证实半径减小能够实现忠实多尺度表示。

Conclusion: 通过减少双曲空间中的嵌入半径，能够更好地保留细粒度结构细节，从而显著提升零样本图学习性能，特别是在需要精细模式识别的异配图上。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Motivation: 节点级异常检测面临结构模式和特征分布多样化的挑战，在欺诈检测、网络安全和推荐系统等应用中至关重要。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Janus始终优于浅层和深层基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合多种几何表示为识别图中微妙复杂异常提供了鲁棒有效的方法。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

<details>

Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥问题在实现中强制执行硬终端约束，导致在高维或数据稀缺情况下不稳定。为了克服这一挑战，需要更灵活的方法。

Method: 采用软约束薛定谔桥问题框架，将终端约束替换为一般惩罚函数，形成更灵活的McKean-Vlasov型随机控制公式。

Result: 建立了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，证明当惩罚增大时，控制和价值函数以线性速率收敛到经典薛定谔桥问题的解。

Conclusion: 软约束桥方法不仅提供了首个定量收敛保证，还揭示了惩罚正则化如何实现鲁棒的生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展且实用的训练数据分析，能够有效分析训练数据如何塑造模型行为。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全分类器过滤方法存在缺陷，通过微调生成器减少被过滤概率往往会使模型产生靠近分类器决策边界的样本，导致假阳性和假阴性增加。

Method: 使用强化学习微调方法，明确引导生成远离分类器的边界区域。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示基准测试中，Boundary Guidance提高了输出的安全性和实用性，LLM-as-a-Judge评估证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模和奖励设计下都表现出鲁棒性，为生成模型的安全部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

TL;DR: 提出一种将显式负陈述整合到知识嵌入学习中的新方法，使用双模型架构分别训练正负陈述，通过相互评分选择负样本，在链接预测和三元组分类任务中优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法大多依赖封闭世界假设，将缺失三元组视为假，这与现实世界的开放世界假设不符。显式负陈述有助于区分假三元组和未知三元组，但很少被包含在知识图谱中且在嵌入训练中被忽视。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个嵌入模型并行训练：一个在正陈述上训练，另一个在负陈述上训练。训练过程中，每个模型通过破坏正样本并选择另一个模型评分最高的候选作为负样本。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，该方法在链接预测和三元组分类任务上的预测性能优于最先进的嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 将有意义负知识整合到嵌入学习中具有重要价值，能显著提升知识图谱嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管变换器架构在序列建模中表现出色，但其在强化学习中的对抗鲁棒性尚未充分探索。决策变换器在对抗性环境中容易受到攻击，需要增强其鲁棒性。

Method: 将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，定义支付函数为后续状态的期望最大值，显式包含随机状态转移。基于阶段博弈的NashQ值来条件化变换器策略。

Result: CART实现了更准确的极小极大值估计，并在多种对抗性随机游戏中持续获得更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART框架成功增强了决策变换器的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持对状态转移不确定性的保守性，为序列建模强化学习方法提供了有效的鲁棒性保障。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

TL;DR: AdaRL提出了一种自适应秩表示的双层优化框架，通过将策略复杂度与任务内在维度对齐来提升鲁棒强化学习的性能，避免了传统min-max优化的计算负担和保守策略问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒强化学习方法依赖嵌套min-max优化，计算成本高且产生过于保守的策略，需要一种更高效且不牺牲性能的鲁棒性方法。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：下层在固定秩约束下进行策略优化，使用Wasserstein球内的动态模型采样；上层自适应调整秩以平衡偏差-方差权衡，将策略参数投影到低秩流形上。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL不仅持续优于固定秩基线和最先进的鲁棒RL方法，而且收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒强化学习提供了高效且原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Motivation: 现实世界系统中需要同时捕捉个人事件和关系事件，但现有工作很少将它们一起考虑，通常将用户行为简化为单一形式化表示（序列或图）。

Method: 引入包含两种事件类型的数据集集合，提出统一的形式化方法，并实证研究结合两种事件类型的模型效果。

Result: 实证结果表明模型从结合两种事件类型中获益，且当前方法仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 发布了相关资源以支持统一用户事件建模的进一步研究，鼓励该方向的发展。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性高度敏感，需要大量人工校准且性能容易退化。

Method: 通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上微调LLM，Locaris学习从原始信号到设备位置的轻量级可泛化映射，将每个AP测量视为标记。

Result: 实验表明Locaris在各种遥测类型上达到或超越现有技术，仅需少量校准点即可保持高精度，在缺失AP情况下仍表现稳健。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为室内定位的校准无关回归模型，在大规模部署中提供可扩展和稳健的跨环境性能。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Motivation: 针对Mao等人(2022)的RestartQ-UCB算法存在的两个核心问题：完全遗忘（重启后丢失所有环境信息）和预定重启（不考虑策略与当前环境动态的兼容性）。

Method: 引入了三种重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，用于改进RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法。

Result: 在多种不同环境中实现了接近最优的实证性能，相对于RestartQ-UCB将动态遗憾降低了高达91%。

Conclusion: 提出的三种重启范式有效解决了非平稳RL中的重启设计问题，显著提升了算法性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output

neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if

every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

Motivation: 传统VAE框架使用KL散度惩罚来鼓励潜在空间匹配因子化高斯先验，但作者发现这种方法在强制聚合后验分布匹配目标分布方面不可靠，导致解耦效果不佳。

Conclusion: 这项工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Method: 引入基于速度驱动的传输成本，具有亚线性指数（0到1之间），奖励联合快速质量移动，并在可扩展的神经ODE训练目标中实例化。

Result: 在合成、图像和生物学数据集上，Y流恢复了层次感知结构，在分布指标上优于强流基方法，并以更少的积分步骤达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和分支结构，有效捕获数据中的层次结构，提高了生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出QLENS框架，将Transformer建模为量子力学系统，通过将隐层激活转换为希尔伯特空间状态向量，将隐藏层重新定义为酉算子和哈密顿量，最终应用玻恩规则获得概率分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer理解方法缺乏数学框架来建模层间状态转换机制，受量子力学与语言模型概率特性的相似性启发，寻求跨学科视角来理解Transformer。

Method: 将Transformer隐层激活转换为希尔伯特空间状态向量，将隐藏层重新定义为酉算子和哈密顿量，应用玻恩规则获得最终概率分布。

Result: 通过玩具Transformer的概念验证，展示了QLENS在分析模型预测轨迹中单个层影响方面的潜力。

Conclusion: QLENS为跨领域洞察提供了基础，有助于更广泛地理解Transformer模型。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CW-DPO是一种两阶段的视觉语言模型对齐方法，通过平滑学习动态和冷却权重机制，解决偏好微调中的梯度不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于偏好的视觉语言模型微调方法存在脆弱性，错误的负样本会注入无信息梯度，导致训练不稳定。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用温和负样本进行监督微调，第二阶段应用冷却权重DPO目标，根据模型对负样本的平均token对数概率来缩放负项权重。

Result: 在多种VLM任务中，CW-DPO相比SFT-only和普通DPO实现了更稳定的优化、更好的校准、更高的配对胜率，且收敛步数更少。

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是鲁棒VLM对齐的简单通用原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

Method: 通过对比使用精确二阶曲率信息（真实Hessian）和准牛顿方法（近似Hessian）在神经网络训练中的表现，分析失败模式和成功案例。

Result: 研究发现，依赖精确曲率信息的神经网络训练会可靠地失败，而准牛顿方法则能成功训练。这一现象挑战了关于损失函数景观充满局部最小值的传统观点。

Conclusion: 神经网络训练中精确二阶曲率信息的失败揭示了非线性离散化的几何特性，并质疑了损失函数景观中局部最小值丰富的传统认知。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

Motivation: Mamba作为新提出的线性时间序列模型，虽然计算效率高且实证表现优异，但其内在机制的理论理解仍然有限，需要深入分析其上下文学习能力。

Method: 研究Mamba在单索引模型上的上下文学习，通过梯度预训练方法分析其测试时特征学习能力，提取上下文示例中的相关方向。

Result: Mamba能够实现高效的上下文学习，其测试时样本复杂度优于线性Transformer（表现为核方法），与非线性Transformer相当，接近信息理论最优速率。

Conclusion: Mamba中的非线性门控机制是实现特征提取的关键因素，这是其同时获得计算效率和高性能的根本驱动力。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Conclusion: VAR模型为生成式分类器提供了新的研究方向，具有计算效率高、可解释性强和抗遗忘等优势，拓展了生成式分类器的应用前景。

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有深度学习睡眠分期模型在未见受试者上泛化能力差，主要原因是生理信号变异性导致的领域偏移问题。现有对比学习方法未能充分提取领域不变特征，因为它们没有明确处理样本间未共享信息中的领域特征。

Method: 提出MEASURE框架，通过多尺度最小充分表示学习来减少领域相关信息，同时保留睡眠分期所需的关键时频特征。该方法避免在高层次信息上过度拟合，充分利用多特征层次中编码的多样化时频信息。

Conclusion: MEASURE框架通过有效减少领域相关信息同时保留必要的时频特征，显著提升了睡眠分期模型在未见领域的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our
code is available at : https://github.com/ku-milab/Measure

Result: 在玩具模型中验证影响力动态变化直接映射到模型语义层次的学习进程；在语言模型中观察到token级影响力变化与已知发展阶段一致。

Conclusion: 神经网络学习过程中的样本影响力是动态变化的，阶段性数据归因能更准确反映模型的学习进程和语义层次构建。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

Conclusion: 模块特定训练策略能够充分利用架构改进的效益，为深度强化学习提供了实用的可扩展性提升方案。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个统一模型，通过状态空间模型直接融入数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定偏置，在语言、视觉和图数据上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer方法依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序集合，忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计任务特定的偏置（如位置嵌入、随机游走）来融入拓扑结构，但这需要大量努力且可能引入副作用阻碍泛化。

Method: 提出Chimera模型，将状态空间模型（自然不需要位置嵌入）推广到捕获任意图拓扑结构。对于有向无环图，可实现为线性时间递归；对于一般图，通过简单数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: Chimera在GLUE上比BERT高0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上比ViT高2.6%，在Long Range Graph Benchmark上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 数据拓扑结构是跨模态的强大归纳偏置，Chimera验证了这一核心贡献，提供了一种无需领域特定偏置就能有效建模数据拓扑的统一方法。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Conclusion: nuGPR框架通过数值线性代数技术有效解决了GPR的高计算成本问题，为大规模GPR应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Method: 通过求解公平性指标（如人口统计平等和均等化几率）的优化问题来计算公平性损失，恶意客户端在训练时增加该损失来发送有偏模型。

Result: 攻击效果显著，即使只有一个恶意客户端，也能将偏见增加高达90%，且保持全局准确性，难以被检测。

Conclusion: 该攻击对现有的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案构成威胁，揭示了联邦学习系统在公平性方面的脆弱性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个最小化推理框架，支持小型transformer进行基本的自验证反思，证明了自验证反思在验证误差有界时能保证性能提升，实验显示小模型在整数乘法和数独任务中达到LLM级别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析大型语言模型在思维链推理中自验证反思的实际贡献，因为现有研究发现LLM在思维链中检测错误的能力有限，反思如何带来实证改进仍不明确。

Method: 设计一个最小化推理框架，支持小型transformer进行基本的自验证反思，避免自然语言以确保分析清晰度并降低实验成本。

Result: 小至几百万参数的transformer在训练和反思执行中都能从自验证中受益，在整数乘法和数独任务中达到显著的LLM级别性能。强化学习主要优化浅层统计模式而非忠实减少验证误差。

Conclusion: 将生成式transformer与判别式验证相结合，本质上促进了思维链推理，这种效果与模型规模和自然语言无关。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文对元学习样本重加权方法在标签噪声下的训练动态进行了理论分析，揭示了其三个阶段的训练轨迹，并基于分析提出了一个轻量级替代方法，在噪声标签基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的元学习样本重加权方法虽然能利用小规模干净子集指导训练以缓解标签噪声问题，但其行为机制和训练动态缺乏理论理解，需要深入分析来指导更有效的算法设计。

Method: 首先对元重加权方法在标签噪声下的训练过程进行严格理论分析，识别三个训练阶段；然后基于分析设计轻量级替代方法，整合均值中心化、行移位和标签符号调制，避免昂贵的双层优化。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声标签基准测试中，所提出的方法持续优于强重加权/选择基线方法，同时提供更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: 元重加权的训练动态可分为对齐、过滤和后过滤三个阶段，其机制依赖于训练信号与干净子集信号的相似性加权耦合；基于此理解设计的轻量级替代方法能有效处理标签噪声问题。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

Motivation: 医疗应用中的早期时间序列分类至关重要，如ICU中的脓毒症预测，延迟预测会导致大量死亡。现有方法在准确性和早期性之间存在权衡，难以捕捉早期微弱信号和解决类别不平衡问题。

Method: 提出DE3S框架：1）双增强策略结合传统时间增强和注意力全局增强；2）基于注意力得分的软形状稀疏化机制；3）双路径混合专家网络和Inception模块融合架构，使用加权交叉熵损失处理类别不平衡。

Conclusion: DE3S方法通过创新的形状学习框架，在医疗早期时间序列分类中实现了准确性和早期性的平衡，具有很好的鲁棒性和性能表现。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion框架，通过Koopman算子理论将非线性扩散动态提升到线性空间，实现一步采样和可解释生成轨迹，解决扩散模型采样慢与可解释性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但迭代去噪过程导致采样速度慢。现有一步方法虽然加速推理，却牺牲了扩散动态的可解释性和精细控制能力，而这些正是支持可编辑生成等应用的关键优势。

Method: 基于Koopman算子理论，将非线性扩散动态提升到潜在空间，其中演化由全局线性算子控制，实现闭式轨迹解。设计分层架构，通过尺度特定的Koopman子空间解耦空间分辨率上的生成动态，系统捕获从粗到细的细节。

Result: Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion不仅实现有竞争力的一步生成性能，还通过谱分析提供了理解和操作生成过程的原则性机制。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样与可解释性之间的差距，为生成建模中的可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

Motivation: 现有的图神经网络攻击方法只针对结构或文本单一方面，缺乏统一的多维度攻击框架来全面评估Graph-LLM的脆弱性。

Method: IMDGA包含三个紧密集成的模块，通过协调多层次的扰动来平衡可解释性和攻击效果，同时攻击图结构和文本特征。

Result: 在多种数据集和架构上的实验表明，IMDGA在可解释性、攻击效果、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了Graph-LLM中先前未被充分探索的语义维度脆弱性，为提升其鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

Conclusion: 实例特定的动态适配方法能有效整合分子图结构与LLM，在保持模型通用能力的同时显著提升分子任务性能。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

Motivation: 在表演性学习中，数据分布会因部署的模型而改变（如用户策略性调整特征），这比传统监督学习更复杂。需要同时优化当前数据和考虑模型可能引发的分布变化。

Method: 通过高维岭回归研究正则化的影响，分析表演性效应在不同参数化情况下的作用，并在合成和真实数据集上进行实证评估。

Result: 表演性效应在总体设置下会恶化测试风险，但在过参数化情况下可能有益。最优正则化与表演性效应强度成正比。

Conclusion: 正则化可以有效应对表演性效应，特别是在过参数化情况下，且可以通过预估表演性效应强度来设置合适的正则化参数。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively

Conclusion: HiLoRA通过自适应分层路由机制，无需训练即可有效复用现有LoRA模块，显著提升领域泛化性能，具有理论保证和实际部署价值。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Motivation: 传统PIELM在处理涉及高频和变频率行为的偏微分方程时面临挑战，需要改进以有效捕捉目标解的不同频率分量。

Method: 1) 将傅里叶特征映射变体集成到ELM中作为基于傅里叶的激活函数；2) 为隐藏神经元分配频率系数集合；3) 开发创新的超参数初始化方法，通过监控ELM输出权重的分布。

Conclusion: GFF-PIELM成功扩展了PIELM解决高频和变频率PDE的能力，其初始化策略可能进一步启发其他物理信息机器学习框架的进展。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

Method: 开发理论框架限制策略更新在当前策略的邻域内，结合局部转移和奖励损失与正则化策略更新，提出DeepSPI算法。

Result: 在ALE-57基准测试中，DeepSPI表现与PPO和DeepMDPs等强基线相当或更优，同时保持理论保证。

Conclusion: 成功将安全策略改进理论扩展到在线深度强化学习，为策略更新提供了理论保证的实用算法。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次对在马尔可夫采样下具有演化奖励函数的单时间尺度actor-critic算法进行了有限时间收敛性分析，证明了在奖励参数缓慢变化时仍能达到O(1/√T)的收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实用的强化学习算法使用演化奖励函数（如奖励塑造、熵正则化、课程学习），但缺乏理论分析基础。本文旨在为这些技术提供理论支撑。

Method: 采用单时间尺度actor-critic算法，考虑奖励参数在每个时间步可能变化的情况，在马尔可夫采样下分析策略优化和价值估计的收敛性。

Result: 在标准假设下，推导了actor和critic误差的非渐近界，证明了当奖励参数演化足够缓慢时，可以达到O(1/√T)的收敛速率，与静态奖励的最佳已知速率相匹配。

Conclusion: 该研究为许多流行的RL技术提供了理论基础，表明在奖励函数通过有界梯度的基于梯度的规则更新时，仍能保持最佳收敛速率。同时改进了静态奖励情况下分布不匹配分析的最佳已知速率。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

TL;DR: 提出基于TSP的token重排序策略和后期处理步骤，解决同态加密下LLM文本生成的挑战，特别是下一个token预测问题，提高生成文本的连贯性并保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户越来越多地使用私有信息与大型语言模型交互，安全加密通信变得至关重要。同态加密虽然提供了在加密数据上直接计算的解决方案，但文本生成特别是下一个token预测在HE下的实现仍然是一个关键障碍。

Method: 采用基于旅行商问题(TSP)的token重排序策略来处理加密文本生成的困难，并加入后期处理步骤进一步减少近似误差。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法防止了模型崩溃，提高了生成文本的连贯性，并在整个过程中保持了数据隐私。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性，为加密交互提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

TL;DR: 本文针对跨模态数据错误检测问题，在表格数据上对多种方法进行了基准测试，发现Cleanlab和DataScope在配合AutoML框架时表现最佳，但现有方法在处理真实世界重尾数据时仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型组织在确保数据质量方面面临挑战，传统错误检测方法通常只关注单一模态（如表），而忽略了电子商务、医疗等领域中常见的跨模态错误（图像、表格和文本数据共存）。

Method: 在四个数据集上对五种基线方法进行基准测试，评估跨模态错误检测在表格数据中的表现。

Result: Cleanlab（标签错误检测框架）和DataScope（数据估值方法）在配合强大的AutoML框架时表现最佳，获得了最高的F1分数。

Conclusion: 当前方法在处理真实世界重尾数据时仍然有限，这推动了该领域的进一步研究需求。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

Motivation: 现有GNN预训练方法主要针对同构图设计，而现实图大多是异构图，且存在语义不匹配问题（原始数据与理想可迁移语义信息数据之间的差异）。

Method: 设计了结构感知预训练任务捕获异构图结构特性，以及语义感知预训练任务通过构建语义邻居扰动子空间来处理语义不匹配问题。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效预训练异构图神经网络，通过结构感知和语义感知任务解决了语义不匹配问题，提升了模型的可迁移性。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

### [194] [Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Kaizhao Liang,Baiyu Su,Cong Xie,Nuo Wang Pierse,Chen Liang,Ni Lao,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种简单的一行代码修改，只在参数坐标与优化器更新方向一致时应用权重衰减，无需新超参数即可提升语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦权重衰减会隐式优化正则化或约束目标，而CWD旨在保留原始损失函数，寻找未修改目标的局部帕累托最优解。

Method: CWD是优化器无关的修改，仅对与优化器更新方向一致的参数坐标应用权重衰减，可解释为在到达平稳流形时诱导滑动模式行为。

Result: 在百万到十亿参数规模的语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD持续改善了最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD是一种即插即用的改进方法，适用于AdamW、Lion和Muon等优化器，无需额外调参即可提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统晶体距离函数存在四个关键缺陷：无法量化相似度、不能区分组成和结构差异、缺乏Lipschitz连续性、以及独特性度量对样本排列不具不变性，这些问题限制了生成模型评估的可靠性。

Method: 开发两种连续距离函数，理论上克服传统距离函数的局限性，能够更准确地评估生成晶体材料的独特性和新颖性。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的距离函数能够揭示传统方法遗漏的洞见，为无机晶体生成模型的评估和比较提供了更可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为生成式AI模型在功能材料发现领域的评估提供了更准确和可靠的度量标准，有助于解决气候变化等重大科学挑战。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数具有特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性。

Method: 使用高斯过程建模需求函数作为价格的黑盒函数，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，适用于无限和有限库存两种场景。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境中动态定价的强大实用工具，提供了后悔保证来量化学习效率。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化能力的关系，发现尖锐最小值在正则化下可能带来更好的泛化性能、校准性和鲁棒性，挑战了平坦最小值必然对应更好泛化的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为平坦最小值与更好的泛化能力相关，但近期研究出现了理论反例和实证例外。本文旨在重新探讨尖锐性在模型性能中的作用。

Method: 进行了广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较了不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）下的损失景观几何特性。

Result: 发现正则化模型倾向于收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值反而表现出更好的泛化能力、校准性、鲁棒性和功能一致性。无正则化的基线模型收敛到更平坦的最小值但性能更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦度本身决定了解的几何特性，尖锐最小值可能反映了更合适的归纳偏置，需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Motivation: 扩散模型在处理复杂分布间的转换任务时存在局限，而桥匹配方法虽然能解决分布间转换问题，但尚未应用于时间相关数据序列，这在需要保持时间一致性的视频任务中尤为关键。

Method: TCVBM框架扩展桥匹配到时间相关视频序列，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，将时间相关性直接整合到采样过程中。

Result: 在帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个任务中，TCVBM在多个定量指标上均取得优越性能，显示出更好的生成质量和重建保真度。

Conclusion: TCVBM成功将桥匹配扩展到时间相关视频序列，通过显式建模时间相关性显著提升了视频生成任务的表现。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

Motivation: 现有方法在多尺度建模时往往独立处理各尺度信息或使用简单特征融合，忽略了异常发生时跨尺度关联的动态变化，且大多基于固定滑动窗口，限制了上下文信息的全面捕捉。

Method: 提出跨尺度重建方法，从粗粒度序列重建细粒度序列以显式捕捉跨尺度关联；设计查询库并整合全局多尺度上下文来克服固定窗口大小的限制。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上使用九种评估指标进行的广泛实验验证了CrossAD的有效性，在异常检测方面展现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD框架通过显式建模跨尺度关联和利用全局多尺度上下文，显著提升了时间序列异常检测的性能，证明了考虑跨尺度动态关联和跨窗口建模的重要性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL通过创新的发布/订阅架构有效解决了垂直联邦学习的效率瓶颈，在保持隐私安全的同时显著提升了训练性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型存在一个被长期忽视但普遍的问题：预定义噪声水平与采样过程中间状态实际编码的噪声水平不匹配，这种噪声偏移会导致次优生成质量。

Method: 提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法，明确引导采样轨迹与预定义噪声调度保持一致；还引入了无需分类器的NAG变体，通过噪声条件丢弃联合训练噪声条件和非条件模型。

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中普遍存在的系统性问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，能显著改善生成性能。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文研究具有上下文信息的多臂老虎机问题，目标是在确保每个臂在不同上下文中获得最低总奖励的同时，最大化总累积奖励。该框架适用于需要公平收入分配且存在上下文变化的实际应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中需要在上下文变化下确保公平收入分配的问题，其中跨上下文的最低奖励约束聚合带来了技术挑战，特别是缺乏标准MAB设置中的闭式最优分配。

Method: 设计并分析了两种算法：乐观优先考虑性能的算法和悲观强制约束满足的算法。为每种算法推导了问题相关的遗憾和约束违反上界。

Result: 建立了问题相关的遗憾和约束违反上界，并证明了对时间范围的依赖在一般情况下是最优的，揭示了先前工作中利用的自由探索原则的基本局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有跨上下文最低奖励约束的多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法解决方案，并建立了理论性能保证，揭示了此类问题的基本限制。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Motivation: 理解知识蒸馏的功能性影响，量化其压缩能力和知识转移机制，分离压缩与架构缩减的影响。

Method: 使用假设检验、对照实验和随机控制蒸馏，分析多种蒸馏变体和模型尺寸的蒸馏缩放规律。

Result: 在某些模态和架构中存在统计显著的知识转移，但程度低于预期；显著转移时存在严重的负面知识不对称转移。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏主要作为数据依赖的正则化器，而非压缩机制，存在负面不对称回报的安全隐患。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦粗粒化变量发现和动力学拟合问题，稳定了表示学习，为快速可重用的粗粒化流程提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

Motivation: 解决传统主动特征获取方法仅限于单一预定义任务的问题，提高在不同任务间的可扩展性

Method: L2M包含可靠的未见任务不确定性量化和基于条件互信息最大化的不确定性引导贪婪特征获取代理，采用序列建模或自回归预训练方法处理任意缺失模式

Result: 在合成和真实表格数据基准测试中，L2M匹配或超越任务特定基线，特别是在标签稀缺和高缺失率情况下表现更优

Conclusion: L2M能够直接在具有回顾性缺失的数据集上操作，执行元AFA任务无需每个任务重新训练，提高了方法的实用性和可扩展性

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

Conclusion: 通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构，Laminar有效解决了RL后训练中的可扩展性问题，显著提升了训练效率和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了贝尔曼-瓦瑟斯坦距离(BWD)，一种无需训练智能体就能评估离线强化学习数据集质量的方法，并能作为正则化器提升策略优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习的数据集质量差异很大，但事先难以评估数据集质量，因为不知道数据的来源和技能组成。这导致算法选择困难。

Method: 研究了从简单累积奖励到基于学习价值的估计器的一系列代理指标，并引入了BWD——一种价值感知的最优传输评分，通过行为评论家和状态条件OT公式计算，无需环境交互或完整策略优化。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务中，BWD与多个离线RL算法的oracle性能得分强相关，能有效预测标准智能体在给定数据集上的表现。将BWD作为正则化器还能提升回报。

Conclusion: 像BWD这样的价值感知分布信号是处理离线RL数据集和策略优化的实用工具。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving
deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems
as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging,
especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation
Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT通过双流表示学习和自适应噪声抑制机制，为表格数据监督学习提供了更鲁棒的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Method: 分析影响可控性的四个关键因素：更大数据规模、使用不同问题的思维/无思维答案、适度增加无思维数据量、采用先训练推理能力再应用混合思维的两阶段策略。

Result: 相比标准训练，提出的方法在保持两种模式准确率的同时，显著减少了无思维模式的输出长度（从1085降至585）和推理支持性token的出现次数（从5917降至522）。

Conclusion: 当前混合思维方法存在局限性，本文的研究结果为增强其可控性提供了方向。

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

TL;DR: 提出了CoRA框架，通过保持预训练基础模型参数不变，结合Granger因果嵌入和零初始化条件注入机制，有效整合多模态外生协变量，提升时间序列基础模型的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型大多在单变量时间序列上预训练，忽略了现实预测任务中多变量间的复杂依赖关系和多样化协变量的重要信息，限制了模型性能。

Method: CoRA框架保持预训练基础模型主干作为冻结特征提取器，使用Granger因果嵌入自动评估协变量的因果预测能力，通过零初始化条件注入机制逐步整合外生信息。

Result: 在协变量感知预测任务上实现了31.1%的MSE降低，在完整或少量训练样本下均优于最先进的协变量感知深度预测模型。

Conclusion: CoRA框架与各种先进时间序列基础模型兼容性强，能扩展到多模态协变量，为时间序列基础模型的实际应用提供了实用范例。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了GPS轨迹稀疏和标签稀缺的问题，在城际客车异常停靠检测中表现出色，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network
activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU
activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature
space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition
of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
cell-count, as the model is trained.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARVQ是一种结合校正适配器和分组残差向量量化的后训练压缩方法，可将LLM嵌入层压缩至约1.6比特，显著减少存储需求和内存占用，适用于边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的嵌入层参数庞大，导致存储需求高和内存占用大，特别是在边缘设备上内存受限，压缩嵌入层可以释放内存带宽并加速推理。

Method: 采用校正适配器与分组残差向量量化相结合的方法，通过线性和非线性映射的组合来模拟原始模型嵌入，无需专用硬件支持低位存储。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM上测试，包括LLaMA-3.2-1B、LLaMA-3.2-3B等，在生成、判别、数学和推理任务中，CARVQ在大多数情况下能实现更低的平均比特数，同时保持合理的困惑度和准确率。

Conclusion: CARVQ是一种与最先进变换器量化方法兼容的压缩技术，可无缝集成到支持4位内存的任何硬件中，为LLM在边缘设备上的高效部署迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了决策树优化中局部搜索操作的参数化复杂度，发现调整阈值或交换特征的错误最小化问题是NP完全的，但在特征数d和域大小D都很小时具有固定参数可解性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树学习算法通常包含启发式局部搜索操作（如调整切割阈值或交换特征），但缺乏对这些操作计算复杂度的系统分析。

Method: 采用参数化复杂度理论分析，考虑特征数d、域大小D等参数，证明问题的NP完全性，并设计固定参数可解算法。

Result: 发现当特征数d和域大小D都很小时，问题可在(D+1)^(2d) · |I|^O(1)时间内求解，并提供了概念验证实现和实证结果。

Conclusion: 决策树局部搜索优化问题的难度由特征数和域大小共同决定，两者都小时问题可高效求解，这为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Conclusion: 分层联邦学习架构在农业应用中具有显著优势，能够同时实现本地专业化和全局泛化，同时保护数据隐私并减少通信开销。

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

Motivation: 传统变量重要性方法依赖于单一模型和观测到的特征，但变量重要性受模型中包含的其他变量影响，且重要变量常被遗漏。此外，Rashomon效应表明不同模型可能给出不同的变量重要性估计。

Method: 引入UNIVERSE方法，通过Rashomon集合（数据集中近似最优模型的集合）来估计变量重要性，即使在存在缺失特征的情况下也能提供真实变量重要性的边界。

Result: 理论分析证明了方法的稳健性，在半合成模拟实验中表现出色，并在信用风险评估任务中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE方法为变量重要性估计提供了更可靠的框架，能够处理缺失特征和Rashomon效应带来的挑战。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

Motivation: 深度神经网络极易受到对抗攻击的威胁，这对安全和关键应用构成重大风险，需要开发轻量级、即插即用的检测解决方案。

Method: 使用KL散度（对密集低幅扰动敏感）和L0相似度（对稀疏高影响变化敏感）两种互补指标，当它们的类别预测不一致时检测对抗攻击。仅需在预训练图像编码器上使用干净图像进行简单微调。

Conclusion: KoALA提供了一个轻量级、即插即用的对抗检测解决方案，适用于现有模型和各种数据模态，无需架构修改或对抗训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何构建概率预测器，使其能为多个决策者提供准确的决策依据。作者比较了两种现有方法（基于多校准的boosting方法和基于对抗博弈的方法）的局限性，并提出了一种更直接的非随机化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在构建适用于多个决策者的预测器时存在不足：基于多校准的方法样本复杂度不优，基于对抗博弈的方法会产生复杂的随机化预测器。

Method: 作者设计了一种更直接的非随机化算法，利用了proper loss集合的结构特性，改进了现有的在线到批量转换方法。

Result: 证明了多校准问题比全预测问题更困难，因此基于多校准的方法必然会有次优的样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出的新算法能够更有效地构建适用于多个决策者的概率预测器，避免了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.
