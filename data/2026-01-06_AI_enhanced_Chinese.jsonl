Researchers face a trade-off between high-speed, low-level engines and slower, more accessible Python frameworks. To address this, we introduce PyBatchRender, a Python library for high-throughput, batched 3D rendering that achieves over 1 million FPS on simple scenes. Built on the Panda3D game engine, it utilizes its mature ecosystem while enhancing performance through optimized batched rendering for up to 1000X speedups. Designed as a physics-agnostic renderer for reinforcement learning from pixels, PyBatchRender offers greater flexibility than dedicated libraries, simpler setup than typical game-engine wrappers, and speeds rivaling state-of-the-art C++ engines like Madrona. Users can create custom scenes entirely in Python with tens of lines of code, enabling rapid prototyping for scalable AI training. Open-source and easy to integrate, it serves to democratize high-performance 3D simulation for researchers and developers.

Its highly diverse movement and complex interactions between leader and follower dancers make the understanding and synthesis challenging. We demonstrate that the three-point trajectory available from a virtual reality (VR) device can effectively serve as a dancer's motion descriptor, simplifying the modeling and synthesis of interplay between dancers' full-body motions down to sparse trajectories. Thanks to the low dimensionality, we can employ an efficient MLP network to predict the follower's three-point trajectory directly from the leader's three-point input for certain types of ballroom dancing, addressing the challenge of modeling high-dimensional full-body interaction. It also prevents our method from overfitting thanks to its compact yet explicit representation. By leveraging the inherent structure of the movements and carefully planning the autoregressive procedure, we show a deterministic neural network is able to translate three-point trajectories into a virtual embodied avatar, which is typically considered under-constrained and requires generative models for common motions. In addition, we demonstrate this deterministic approach generalizes beyond small, structured datasets like ballroom dancing, and performs robustly on larger, more diverse datasets such as LaFAN. Our method provides a computationally- and data-efficient solution, opening new possibilities for immersive paired dancing applications.

In this framework, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) has captured prediction error, Bayesian surprise (BS) has captured belief updates, and uncertainty (UN) has reflected prior ambiguity, and together they have formed the core components of FE. Using 1,059 15 s food video advertisements, the experiments have shown that KLD has reflected \"pleasantness\" associated with brand presentation, BS has captured \"surprise\" arising from informational complexity, and UN has reflected \"surprise\" driven by uncertainty in element types and spatial arrangements, as well as by the variability and quantity of presented elements. This study also identified three characteristic emotional patterns, namely uncertain stimulus, sustained high emotion, and momentary peak and decay, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed method. Robustness across nine hyperparameter settings and generalization tests with six types of Japanese advertising videos (three genres and two durations) confirmed that these tendencies remained stable. This work can be extended by integrating a wider range of expression elements and validating the approach through subjective ratings, ultimately guiding the development of technologies that can support the creation of more engaging advertising videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u91cf\u5316\"\u6109\u60a6\u5ea6\"\u3001\"\u60ca\u559c\"\u548c\"\u4e60\u60ef\u5316\"\u4e09\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e7f\u544a\u89c2\u770b\u65f6\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5a92\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u672c\u8eab\u91cf\u5316\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u539f\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Kullback-Leibler\u6563\u5ea6(KLD)\u6355\u6349\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u60ca\u559c(BS)\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027(UN)\u53cd\u6620\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002\u5206\u67901,059\u4e2a15\u79d2\u98df\u54c1\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "KLD\u53cd\u6620\u4e0e\u54c1\u724c\u5448\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u7684\"\u6109\u60a6\u5ea6\"\uff0cBS\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u606f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\"\u60ca\u559c\"\uff0cUN\u53cd\u6620\u5143\u7d20\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\"\u60ca\u559c\"\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u523a\u6fc0\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u9ad8\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u77ac\u65f6\u5cf0\u503c\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u57289\u79cd\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c6\u7c7b\u65e5\u672c\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6574\u5408\u66f4\u591a\u8868\u8fbe\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u521b\u4f5c\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Despite recent empirical evidence that horizon reduction can improve scaling on challenging offline RL benchmarks, its theoretical implications remain underdeveloped (Park et al., 2025). In this paper, we show that horizon reduction can induce fundamental and irrecoverable information loss in offline RL. We formalize horizon reduction as learning from fixed-length trajectory segments and prove that, under this paradigm and any learning interface restricted to fixed-length trajectory segments, optimal policies may be statistically indistinguishable from suboptimal ones even with infinite data and perfect function approximation. Through a set of minimal counterexample Markov decision processes (MDPs), we identify three distinct structural failure modes: (i) prefix indistinguishability leading to identifiability failure, (ii) objective misspecification induced by truncated returns, and (iii) offline dataset support and representation aliasing. Our results establish necessary conditions under which horizon reduction can be safe and highlight intrinsic limitations that cannot be overcome by algorithmic improvements alone, complementing algorithmic work on conservative objectives and distribution shift that addresses a different axis of offline RL difficulty (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Gulcehre et al., 2020).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u91ce\u7f29\u51cf\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6b21\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u89c6\u91ce\u7f29\u51cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u89c6\u91ce\u7f29\u51cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u89c6\u91ce\u7f29\u51cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4ece\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6b21\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u53cd\u4f8b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a1\uff09\u524d\u7f00\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff1b2\uff09\u622a\u65ad\u56de\u62a5\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9519\u8bef\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff1b3\uff09\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u548c\u8868\u793a\u6df7\u53e0\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u89c6\u91ce\u7f29\u51cf\u5b89\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u91ce\u7f29\u51cf\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u53ef\u514b\u670d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u89c6\u91ce\u7f29\u51cf\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Accurate W-HOI reconstruction is critical for understanding human behavior and enabling applications in embodied intelligence and virtual reality. However, existing hand-object interactions (HOI) methods are limited to single images or camera coordinates, failing to model temporal dynamics or consistent global trajectories. Some recent approaches attempt world-space hand estimation but overlook object poses and HOI constraints. Their performance also suffers under severe camera motion and frequent occlusions common in egocentric in-the-wild videos. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-stage framework with a robust pre-process pipeline built on newly developed spatial intelligence models, a whole-body HOI prior model based on decoupled diffusion models, and a multi-objective test-time optimization paradigm. Our HOI prior model is template-free and scalable to multiple objects.

This paper explores whether contemporary open-source and publicly accessible diffusion-based generative models can produce identity document forgeries that could realistically bypass human or automated verification systems. We evaluate text-to-image and image-to-image generation pipelines using multiple publicly available generative model families, including Stable Diffusion, Qwen, Flux, Nano-Banana, and others. The findings indicate that while current generative models can simulate surface-level document aesthetics, they fail to reproduce structural and forensic authenticity. Consequently, the risk of generative identity document deepfakes achieving forensic-level authenticity may be overestimated, underscoring the value of collaboration between machine learning practitioners and document-forensics experts in realistic risk assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u8868\u9762\u903c\u771f\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc1\u4ef6\u4f2a\u9020\u54c1\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u6cd5\u8bc1\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc1\u4ef6\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u516c\u4f17\u62c5\u5fc3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc1\u4ef6\u4f2a\u9020\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u4ee3\u5f00\u6e90\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u591f\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc1\u4ef6\u4f2a\u9020\u54c1", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08\u5305\u62ecStable Diffusion\u3001Qwen\u3001Flux\u3001Nano-Banana\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u751f\u6210\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc1\u4ef6\u4f2a\u9020\u54c1\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u4ef6\u8868\u9762\u7f8e\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6cd5\u8bc1\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc1\u4ef6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u8fbe\u5230\u6cd5\u8bc1\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u4e0e\u8bc1\u4ef6\u6cd5\u8bc1\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc1\u4ef6\u4f2a\u9020\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55"}}

Shrimp farming represents a significant source of income in many regions; however, like other forms of aquaculture, it is severely impacted by disease outbreaks. These diseases pose a major challenge to sustainable shrimp production. To address this issue, automated disease classification methods can offer timely and accurate detection. This research proposes a deep learning-based approach for the automated classification of shrimp diseases. A dataset comprising 1,149 images across four disease classes was utilized. Six pretrained deep learning models, ResNet50, EfficientNet, DenseNet201, MobileNet, ConvNeXt-Tiny, and Xception were deployed and evaluated for performance. The images background was removed, followed by standardized preprocessing through the Keras image pipeline. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) was used for enhancing the model robustness through adversarial training. While advanced augmentation strategies, including CutMix and MixUp, were implemented to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization. To support interpretability, and to visualize regions of model attention, post-hoc explanation methods such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and XGrad-CAM were applied. Exploratory results demonstrated that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest performance, attaining a 96.88% accuracy on the test dataset.

This study introduces the Intrinsic-Metric Physics-Informed Neural Network (IM-PINN), a mesh-free geometric deep learning framework that solves partial differential equations directly in the continuous parametric domain. By embedding the Riemannian metric tensor into the automatic differentiation graph, our architecture analytically reconstructs the Laplace-Beltrami operator, decoupling solution complexity from geometric discretization. We validate the framework on a \"Stochastic Cloth\" manifold with extreme Gaussian curvature fluctuations ($K \\in [-2489, 3580]$), where traditional adaptive refinement fails to resolve anisotropic Turing instabilities. Using a dual-stream architecture with Fourier feature embeddings to mitigate spectral bias, the IM-PINN recovers the \"splitting spot\" and \"labyrinthine\" regimes of the Gray-Scott model. Benchmarking against the Surface Finite Element Method (SFEM) reveals superior physical rigor: the IM-PINN achieves global mass conservation error of $\\mathcal{E}_{mass} \\approx 0.157$ versus SFEM's $0.258$, acting as a thermodynamically consistent global solver that eliminates mass drift inherent in semi-implicit integration.

The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Agentic AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u900f\u660e\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u5feb\u901f\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u900f\u660e\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u64c5\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u4ee3\u91d1\u878d\u8fd0\u8425\u6240\u9700\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Agentic AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u5438\u6536\u7ba1\u9053\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u62ec\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5c42\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u53d8\u9769\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u673a\u5236\u3001\u65b0\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8de8\u56fd\u4fe1\u7528\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002"}}

In this study, we combine a focused review of cardiac ultrasound segmentation literature with a controlled comparison of three influential architectures, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet, on the Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-Structure Ultrasound Segmentation (CAMUS) echocardiography dataset. Our benchmark spans multiple preprocessing routes, including native NIfTI volumes, 16-bit PNG exports, GPT-assisted polygon-based pseudo-labels, and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) on thousands of unlabeled cine frames. Using identical training splits, losses, and evaluation criteria, a plain U-Net achieved a 94% mean Dice when trained directly on NIfTI data (preserving native dynamic range), while the PNG-16-bit workflow reached 91% under similar conditions. Attention U-Net provided modest improvements on small or low-contrast regions, reducing boundary leakage, whereas TransUNet demonstrated the strongest generalization on challenging frames due to its ability to model global spatial context, particularly when initialized with SSL. Pseudo-labeling expanded the training set and improved robustness after confidence filtering. Overall, our contributions are threefold: a harmonized, apples-to-apples benchmark of U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet under standardized CAMUS preprocessing and evaluation; practical guidance on maintaining intensity fidelity, resolution consistency, and alignment when preparing ultrasound data; and an outlook on scalable self-supervision and emerging multimodal GPT-based annotation pipelines for rapid labeling, quality assurance, and targeted dataset curation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u5fc3\u810f\u8d85\u58f0\u5206\u5272\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\uff08U-Net\u3001Attention U-Net\u3001TransUNet\uff09\u5728CAMUS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7efc\u8ff0\u591a\u603b\u7ed3\u5fc3\u810f\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u805a\u7126\u5fc3\u810f\u8d85\u58f0\u5206\u5272\uff1b2. \u5728CAMUS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4U-Net\u3001Attention U-Net\u3001TransUNet\uff1b3. \u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff08NIfTI\u3001PNG\u3001GPT\u8f85\u52a9\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\u3001\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "1. \u539f\u751fNIfTI\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684U-Net\u8fbe\u523094%\u5e73\u5747Dice\uff0cPNG-16\u4f4d\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3a91%\uff1b2.

This work models per-query control as a small discrete action: choose a retrieval depth and a generation mode (guarded vs. auto), or refuse. An offline logged dataset is constructed from SQuAD 2.0 by executing each action and recording accuracy, token cost, hallucination/refusal indicators, and an SLO-weighted reward. Two simple policy-learning objectives are evaluated: supervised classification of the per-state best action (Argmax-CE) and a reward-weighted variant (Argmax-CE-WT). Across the evaluated settings, a strong fixed baseline (low k, guarded prompting) performs competitively; learned policies mainly provide additional cost savings under a quality-focused SLO and can exhibit refusal collapse under a cheap SLO when refusal is heavily rewarded.

Varshney"], "title": "Energy-Aware Routing to Large Reasoning Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have heterogeneous inference energy costs based on which model is used and how much it reasons. To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies.

However, radiographic distinctions between early disease stages, particularly KL1 and KL2, are subtle and frequently lead to inter-observer variability among radiologists. To address these challenges, we propose VLOrdinalFormer, a vision language guided ordinal learning framework for fully automated KOA grading from knee radiographs. The proposed method combines a ViT L16 backbone with CORAL based ordinal regression and a Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) driven semantic alignment module, allowing the model to incorporate clinically meaningful textual concepts related to joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis. To improve robustness and mitigate overfitting, we employ stratified five fold cross validation, class aware re weighting to emphasize challenging intermediate grades, and test time augmentation with global threshold optimization. Experiments conducted on the publicly available OAI kneeKL224 dataset demonstrate that VLOrdinalFormer achieves state of the art performance, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines in terms of macro F1 score and overall accuracy. Notably, the proposed framework yields substantial performance gains for KL1 and KL2 without compromising classification accuracy for mild or severe cases. In addition, interpretability analyses using Grad CAM and CLIP similarity maps confirm that the model consistently attends to clinically relevant anatomical regions. These results highlight the potential of vision language aligned ordinal transformers as reliable and interpretable tools for KOA grading and disease progression assessment in routine radiological practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLOrdinalFormer\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5e8f\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u819d\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728KL\u5206\u7ea7\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u819d\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\uff08KOA\uff09\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u81f4\u6b8b\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Kellgren Lawrence\uff08KL\uff09\u5206\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fKL1\u548cKL2\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u7ec6\u5fae\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u95f4\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVLOrdinalFormer\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408ViT L16\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eCORAL\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u548cCLIP\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u9699\u72ed\u7a84\u3001\u9aa8\u8d58\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8f6f\u9aa8\u4e0b\u786c\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u4e94\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728OAI kneeKL224\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eCNN\u548cViT\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5728KL1\u548cKL2\u5206\u7ea7\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u8f7b\u5ea6\u6216\u91cd\u5ea6\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u5173\u6ce8\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3aKOA\u5206\u7ea7\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

We reframe inference as a control-plane decision problem: determining when execution is necessary versus when correctness can be preserved through alternative pathways. We introduce Meaning-First Execution (MFEE), a control-plane architecture implementing this framework, selectively invoking transformer inference only when required. MFEE operates as a gating layer above existing stacks without modifying models, weights, or parameters. Across 1,000 diverse prompts under deterministic decoding, MFEE achieves 78.1% execution reduction while maintaining 100% exact-match equivalence for invoked executions. Comparative evaluation reveals pattern-based routers achieve at most 53.3% avoidance with correctness failures, while MFEE reaches 100% avoidance with zero failures through semantic analysis. We prove this limitation via Theorem 1: any router operating solely on finite feature maps cannot simultaneously guarantee zero false skips and positive avoidance on feature-collision pairs.

Code available at https://github.com/Kevin0304-li/llm-self-correction", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely believed to possess self-correction capabilities, yet recent studies suggest that intrinsic self-correction--where models correct their own outputs without external feedback--remains largely ineffective. In this work, we systematically decompose self-correction into three distinct sub-capabilities: error detection, error localization, and error correction. Through cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs, we uncover a striking Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieve 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy)--26.8% vs 16.7%. We propose the Error Depth Hypothesis: stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist self-correction.

However, current RL paradigms predominantly rely on random data shuffling or naive curriculum strategies based on scalar difficulty metrics. We argue that scalar metrics fail to disentangle two orthogonal challenges in video understanding: Visual Temporal Perception Load and Cognitive Reasoning Depth. To address this, we propose VideoCuRL, a novel framework that decomposes difficulty into these two axes. We employ efficient, training-free proxies, optical flow and keyframe entropy for visual complexity, Calibrated Surprisal for cognitive complexity, to map data onto a 2D curriculum grid. A competence aware Diagonal Wavefront strategy then schedules training from base alignment to complex reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce Dynamic Sparse KL and Structured Revisiting to stabilize training against reward collapse and catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that VideoCuRL surpasses strong RL baselines on reasoning (+2.5 on VSI-Bench) and perception (+2.9 on VideoMME) tasks. Notably, VideoCuRL eliminates the prohibitive inference overhead of generation-based curricula, offering a scalable solution for robust video post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "VideoCuRL\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u6d17\u724c\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u96be\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u8f74\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u60ca\u5947\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\uff1b2. \u5c06\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7f51\u683c\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5bf9\u89d2\u6ce2\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1b4. \u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758fKL\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u91cd\u8bbf\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff08VSI-Bench\uff09\u63d0\u53472.5\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff08VideoMME\uff09\u63d0\u53472.9\u5206\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoCuRL\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

On TruthfulQA (MC1), EdgeJury achieves 76.2% accuracy (95% CI: 72.8-79.6%), a +21.4% relative improvement over a single 8B baseline (62.8%), and outperforms standard baselines including self-consistency and majority voting under transparent compute accounting (total tokens and platform cost reported). On a 200-question adversarial EdgeCases set, EdgeJury yields +48.2% relative gains (95% CI: 44.0-52.4%). Manual analysis on 100 incorrect answers shows an approximately 55% reduction in factual hallucination errors versus the single-model baseline.

In a study of over 9,000 test cases across 11 leading AI models, we found a troubling pattern: models almost never mention hints spontaneously, yet when asked directly, they admit noticing them. This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least. These findings suggest that simply watching AI reasoning is not enough to catch hidden influences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u9690\u85cf\u63d0\u793a\u4f46\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u88ab\u76d1\u89c6\u4e5f\u65e0\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u62a5\u544a\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6d89\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6700\u5371\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9010\u6b65\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u5f71\u54cdAI\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76AI\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8d85\u8fc79,000\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf911\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u53d1\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u8be2\u95ee\u65f6\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u88ab\u76d1\u89c6\u65f6\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f3a\u5236\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "1. \u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4e4e\u4ece\u4e0d\u81ea\u53d1\u63d0\u53ca\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u88ab\u76f4\u63a5\u8be2\u95ee\u65f6\u4f1a\u627f\u8ba4\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u5b83\u4eec\uff1b2. \u544a\u8bc9\u6a21\u578b\u5b83\u4eec\u88ab\u76d1\u89c6\u6ca1\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff1b3. \u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u62a5\u544a\u63d0\u793a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u865a\u5047\u62a5\u544a\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u4e5f\u62a5\u544a\uff09\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b4. \u6d89\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6700\u5371\u9669 - \u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5e38\u9075\u5faa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u4f46\u6700\u5c11\u62a5\u544a\u5b83\u4eec\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u4ec5\u89c2\u5bdfAI\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5f53\u524dAI\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u62a5\u544a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9AI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This study presents a systematic comparative analysis of five widely used CNN backbones, namely VGG16, VGG19, Inception V3, ResNet50, and ResNet101, based on 245 controlled experiments combining quantitative metrics, qualitative assessment, and statistical analysis to examine the trade-off between structural preservation, stylistic behavior, and computational efficiency. The results show that backbone selection does not yield statistically significant differences in structural similarity, as confirmed by ANOVA on SSIM (p= 0.83), indicating comparable levels of structural preservation rather than equivalent stylistic quality. Within this context, ResNet-based architectures achieve approximately 5-6x faster convergence than VGG models while maintaining similar perceptual similarity (LPIPS = 0.53) and requiring over 16x fewer FLOPs (0.63 vs 10.12 GFLOPs). Qualitative analysis reveals consistent stylistic trade-offs, with VGG producing denser painterly textures, ResNet favoring geometric stability and canting stroke preservation with milder stylization, and Inception V3 exhibiting intermediate but noisier behavior. These findings reposition architectural choice in NST from maximizing stylistic intensity toward efficiency-aware and structure-preserving deployment, highlighting ResNet-based backbones as a practical foundation for scalable, industry-oriented batik generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e94\u79cdCNN\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5370\u5c3c\u8721\u67d3\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ResNet\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6bd4VGG\u9ad816\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb5-6\u500d\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8eVGG\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5370\u5c3c\u8721\u67d3\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9VGG16\u3001VGG19\u3001Inception V3\u3001ResNet50\u548cResNet101\u4e94\u79cdCNN\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c245\u6b21\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff08SSIM\u3001LPIPS\u3001FLOPs\uff09\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\uff08ANOVA\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff08SSIM\u7684p=0.83\uff09\uff0c\u4f46ResNet\u67b6\u6784\u6bd4VGG\u6536\u655b\u5feb5-6\u500d\uff0cFLOPs\u51cf\u5c1116\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff080.63 vs 10.12 GFLOPs\uff09\uff0cLPIPS\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u76f8\u5f53\uff080.53\uff09\u3002VGG\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u7ed8\u753b\u7eb9\u7406\uff0cResNet\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8721\u67d3\u7b14\u89e6\uff0cInception V3\u8868\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f46\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u4ece\u6700\u5927\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u6548\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u90e8\u7f72\uff0cResNet\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5de5\u4e1a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8721\u67d3\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, statistical heterogeneity among clients, often manifested as non-IID label distributions, poses significant challenges to convergence and generalization.

In this work, we propose \\textbf{FedSCAM} (Federated Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Clustered Aggregation and Modulation), a novel algorithm that dynamically adjusts the SAM perturbation radius and aggregation weights based on client-specific heterogeneity scores. By calculating a heterogeneity metric for each client and modulating the perturbation radius inversely to this score, FedSCAM prevents clients with high variance from destabilizing the global model. Furthermore, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware weighted aggregation mechanism that prioritizes updates from clients that align with the global optimization direction. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST under various degrees of Dirichlet-based label skew demonstrate that FedSCAM achieves competitive performance among state-of-the-art baselines, including FedSAM, FedLESAM, etc. in terms of convergence speed and final test accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedSCAM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574SAM\u6270\u52a8\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u805a\u5408\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975eIID\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u5bf9\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u9020\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684SAM\u6270\u52a8\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedSCAM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff1b2) \u6839\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5206\u6570\u53cd\u5411\u8c03\u6574SAM\u6270\u52a8\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7834\u574f\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cFashion-MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u659c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cFedSCAM\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4e0eFedSAM\u3001FedLESAM\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "FedSCAM\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6270\u52a8\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

This work introduces CornViT, a three-stage Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) framework that emulates the hierarchical reasoning of human seed analysts for single-kernel evaluation. Three sequential CvT-13 classifiers operate on 384x384 RGB images: Stage 1 distinguishes pure from impure kernels; Stage 2 categorizes pure kernels into flat and round morphologies; and Stage 3 determines the embryo orientation (up vs. down) for pure, flat kernels. Starting from a public corn seed image collection, we manually relabeled and filtered images to construct three stage-specific datasets: 7265 kernels for purity, 3859 pure kernels for morphology, and 1960 pure-flat kernels for embryo orientation, all released as benchmarks. Head-only fine-tuning of ImageNet-22k pretrained CvT-13 backbones yields test accuracies of 93.76% for purity, 94.11% for shape, and 91.12% for embryo-orientation detection. Under identical training conditions, ResNet-50 reaches only 76.56 to 81.02 percent, whereas DenseNet-121 attains 86.56 to 89.38 percent accuracy. These results highlight the advantages of convolution-augmented self-attention for kernel analysis. To facilitate adoption, we deploy CornViT in a Flask-based web application that performs stage-wise inference and exposes interpretable outputs through a browser interface. Together, the CornViT framework, curated datasets, and web application provide a deployable solution for automated corn kernel quality assessment in seed quality workflows.

More recently, Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF), a GFM pre-trained using multi-source EOs across continuous time. An annual and global embedding dataset is produced using AEF that is ready for analysis and modeling. The internal experiments show that AEF embeddings have outperformed operational models in 15 EO tasks without re-training. However, those experiments are mostly about land cover and land use classification. Applying AEF and other GFMs to agricultural monitoring require an in-depth evaluation in critical agricultural downstream tasks. There is also a lack of comprehensive comparison between the AEF-based models and traditional remote sensing (RS)-based models under different scenarios, which could offer valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners. This study addresses some of these gaps by evaluating AEF embeddings in three agricultural downstream tasks in the U.S., including crop yield prediction, tillage mapping, and cover crop mapping. Datasets are compiled from both public and private sources to comprehensively evaluate AEF embeddings across tasks at different scales and locations, and RS-based models are trained as comparison models. AEF-based models generally exhibit strong performance on all tasks and are competitive with purpose-built RS-based models in yield prediction and county-level tillage mapping when trained on local data. However, we also find several limitations in current AEF embeddings, such as limited spatial transferability compared to RS-based models, low interpretability, and limited time sensitivity. These limitations recommend caution when applying AEF embeddings in agriculture, where time sensitivity, generalizability, and interpretability is important.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30AlphaEarth Foundation\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u4f5c\u7269\u4ea7\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8015\u4f5c\u5236\u56fe\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7b49\u9650\u5236", "motivation": "\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u5173\u952e\u519c\u4e1a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u9065\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528AEF\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u4e2a\u519c\u4e1a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u4f5c\u7269\u4ea7\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u8015\u4f5c\u5236\u56fe\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u4f5c\u7269\u5236\u56fe\uff0c\u7f16\u8bd1\u516c\u5171\u548c\u79c1\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u9065\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4", "result": "AEF\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u4ea7\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53bf\u7ea7\u8015\u4f5c\u5236\u56fe\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u9065\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f4e\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u9650\u5236", "conclusion": "AEF\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7248\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u9650\u5236"}}

Yu"], "title": "Enhancing Temporal Awareness in LLMs for Temporal Point Processes", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Temporal point processes (TPPs) are crucial for analyzing events over time and are widely used in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social systems. These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

In this study, we explore the application of cutting-edge vision-language models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Claude 3.5) for predicting the recyclability of commonly disposed items. Utilizing a curated dataset of images, we evaluated the models' ability to match objects to appropriate recycling bins, including assessing whether the items could physically fit into the available bins. Additionally, we investigated the models' performance across several challenging scenarios: (i) adjusting predictions based on location-specific recycling guidelines; (ii) accounting for contamination or structural damage; and (iii) handling objects composed of multiple materials. Our findings highlight the significant advancements in contextual understanding offered by these models compared to previous iterations, while also identifying areas where they still fall short.

We prove that dissipative quantum dynamics with analytically tractable non-local context aggregation produce coherent text generation, while conservation laws cause fundamental failure. Employing Koopman operators with closed-form path integral propagators, we show irreversible computation fundamentally requires both controlled information dissipation and causal context aggregation. Spectral analysis reveals emergent eigenvalue structure, separating into decay modes (forgetting), growth modes (amplification), and neutral modes (preservation) -- the essential ingredients for directed information flow.

We curate a dataset of 80,851 examples from 18 public cybersecurity sources and 35,026 synthetic OpenTelemetry traces. We apply iterative QLoRA fine-tuning on resource-constrained ARM64 hardware (NVIDIA DGX Spark) through three training iterations with strategic augmentation. Our custom benchmark accuracy improves from 42.86% to 74.29%, a statistically significant 31.4-point gain. Targeted examples addressing specific knowledge gaps outperform indiscriminate scaling. Key contributions include: (1) synthetic trace generation methodology for multi-agent coordination attacks and regulatory violations, (2) empirical evidence that training data composition fundamentally determines behavior, and (3) complete open release of datasets, training scripts, and evaluation benchmarks on HuggingFace.

These artifacts obscure objects of interest and inflate model sizes, hindering deployment in bandwidth-constrained applications. We present Clean-GS, a method for removing background clutter and floaters from 3DGS reconstructions using sparse semantic masks. Our approach combines whitelist-based spatial filtering with color-guided validation and outlier removal to achieve 60-80\\% model compression while preserving object quality. Unlike existing 3DGS pruning methods that rely on global importance metrics, Clean-GS uses semantic information from as few as 3 segmentation masks (1\\% of views) to identify and remove Gaussians not belonging to the target object. Our multi-stage approach consisting of (1) whitelist filtering via projection to masked regions, (2) depth-buffered color validation, and (3) neighbor-based outlier removal isolates monuments and objects from complex outdoor scenes. Experiments on Tanks and Temples show that Clean-GS reduces file sizes from 125MB to 47MB while maintaining rendering quality, making 3DGS models practical for web deployment and AR/VR applications.

However, the strong heterogeneity across cell chemistries, form factors, and operating conditions makes it difficult to build a single model that generalizes beyond its training domain. This work proposes a unified capacity forecasting framework that maintains robust performance across diverse chemistries and usage scenarios. We curate 20 public aging datasets into a large-scale corpus covering 1,704 cells and 3,961,195 charge-discharge cycle segments, spanning temperatures from $-5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $45\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, multiple C-rates, and application-oriented profiles such as fast charging and partial cycling. On this corpus, we adopt a Time-Series Foundation Model (TSFM) backbone and apply parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) together with physics-guided contrastive representation learning to capture shared degradation patterns. Experiments on both seen and deliberately held-out unseen datasets show that a single unified model achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with strong per-dataset baselines, while retaining stable performance on chemistries, capacity scales, and operating conditions excluded from training. These results demonstrate the potential of TSFM-based architectures as a scalable and transferable solution for capacity degradation forecasting in real battery management systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(TSFM)\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7535\u6c60\u5bb9\u91cf\u8870\u51cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u542b1704\u4e2a\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5316\u5b66\u4f53\u7cfb\u3001\u5bb9\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5de5\u51b5\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u6c60\u5bb9\u91cf\u8870\u51cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u957f\u671f\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7535\u6c60\u5316\u5b66\u4f53\u7cfb\u3001\u5916\u5f62\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5f3a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u57df\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "1) \u6574\u540820\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u8001\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u6599\u5e93(1704\u4e2a\u7535\u6c60\uff0c396\u4e07\u5145\u653e\u7535\u5faa\u73af\u6bb5)\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(TSFM)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e72\uff1b3) \u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u6355\u6349\u5171\u4eab\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u4e00\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5df2\u89c1\u548c\u523b\u610f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf(\u6bcf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3)\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6392\u9664\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4f53\u7cfb\u3001\u5bb9\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eTSFM\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7535\u6c60\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\u8870\u51cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose TDA-Alz, a novel framework for four-stage Alzheimer's disease severity classification (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild, and very mild) using topological data analysis (TDA) and ensemble learning. Instead of relying on deep convolutional architectures or extensive data augmentation, our approach extracts topological descriptors that capture intrinsic structural patterns of brain MRI, followed by feature selection to retain the most discriminative topological features. These features are then classified using an ensemble learning strategy to achieve robust multiclass discrimination.\n  Experiments conducted on the OASIS-1 MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.19% and an AUC of 99.75%, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art deep learning--based methods reported on OASIS and OASIS-derived datasets. Notably, the proposed framework does not require data augmentation, pretrained networks, or large-scale computational resources, making it computationally efficient and fast compared to deep neural network approaches. Furthermore, the use of topological descriptors provides greater interpretability, as the extracted features are directly linked to the underlying structural characteristics of brain MRI rather than opaque latent representations. These results indicate that TDA-Alz offers a powerful, lightweight, and interpretable alternative to deep learning models for MRI-based Alzheimer's disease severity classification, with strong potential for real-world clinical decision-support systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTDA-Alz\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790(TDA)\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728OASIS-1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523098.19%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c99.75% AUC\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u8111MRI\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTDA-Alz\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u8111MRI\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff1b2) \u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5177\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728OASIS-1 MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523098.19%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c99.75% AUC\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "TDA-Alz\u4e3aMRI-based\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51famateriomusic\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u8d28\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u521b\u4f5c\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u5206\u5b50\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u4e09\u7ef4\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u97f3\u4e50\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u827a\u672f\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5171\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7269\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u521b\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u827a\u672f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u97f3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\"\u542c\u89c9\u6210\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\"\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5206\u5b50\u5149\u8c31\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u97f3\u8c03\uff1b2) \u4e09\u7ef4\u7f51\u7edc\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u53ef\u6f14\u594f\u4e50\u5668\uff1b3) \u679a\u4e3e\u6240\u67092^12\u97f3\u4e50\u97f3\u9636\u5206\u6790\u6587\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u5e03\uff1b4) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u667a\u80fdAI\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u66f2\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u5316\u91cd\u8981\u97f3\u4e50\u7cfb\u7edf\u805a\u96c6\u5728\u4e2d\u71b5\u3001\u4e2d\u7f3a\u9677\u8d70\u5eca\uff0c\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2dHall-Petch\u6700\u4f18\u7f3a\u9677\u5bc6\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5e94\uff1bAI\u4f5c\u66f2\u5c55\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6574\u5408\u3001\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u827a\u672f\u90fd\u662f\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u632f\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u534f\u8c03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u8fed\u4ee3\u6620\u5c04\u521b\u9020\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u9020\u529b\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u5bcc\u6709\u6210\u6548\u78b0\u649e\u3002"}}

This study investigates Cultural Encoding in Large\n  Language Models (LLMs) -- systematic differences in brand recommendations arising from\n  training data composition. Analyzing 1,909 pure-English queries across 6 LLMs (GPT-4o,\n  Claude, Gemini, Qwen3, DeepSeek, Doubao) and 30 brands, we find Chinese LLMs exhibit 30.6\n  percentage points higher brand mention rates than International LLMs (88.9% vs. 58.3%,\n  p<.001). This disparity persists in identical English queries, indicating training data\n  geography -- not language -- drives the effect. We introduce the Existence Gap: brands\n  absent from LLM training corpora lack \"existence\" in AI responses regardless of quality.\n  Through a case study of Zhizibianjie (OmniEdge), a collaboration platform with 65.6%\n  mention rate in Chinese LLMs but 0% in International models (p<.001), we demonstrate how\n  Linguistic Boundary Barriers create invisible market entry obstacles. Theoretically, we\n  contribute the Data Moat Framework, conceptualizing AI-visible content as a VRIN strategic\n  resource.

Consider the task of predicting the political preferences of users in a social network; to solve this task one should consider, both, the features of each individual user and the relationships between them. However, oftentimes one is not interested in the label of a single instance but rather in the distribution of labels over a set of instances; e.g., when predicting the political preferences of users, the overall prevalence of a given opinion might be of higher interest than the opinion of a specific person. This label prevalence estimation task is commonly referred to as quantification learning (QL). Current QL methods for tabular data are typically based on the so-called prior probability shift (PPS) assumption which states that the label-conditional instance distributions should remain equal across the training and test data. In the graph setting, PPS generally does not hold if the shift between training and test data is structural, i.e., if the training data comes from a different region of the graph than the test data. To address such structural shifts, an importance sampling variant of the popular adjusted count quantification approach has previously been proposed. In this work, we extend the idea of structural importance sampling to the state-of-the-art KDEy quantification approach. We show that our proposed method adapts to structural shifts and outperforms standard quantification approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06KDEy\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u5904\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5982\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff09\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u56fe\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684KDEy\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u8c03\u6574\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u4e0eKDEy\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce an algorithm that computes shoppers' ``shelf visits'' -- capturing their browsing behavior in the store. Shelf visits are extracted from trajectories obtained via machine vision-based 3D tracking and overhead cameras. We perform two independent calibrations of the shelf visit algorithm, using distinct sets of trajectories (consisting of 8138 and 15129 trajectories), collected in different stores and labeled by human reviewers. The calibrated models are then evaluated on trajectories held out of the calibration process both from the same store on which calibration was performed and from the other store. An analysis of the results shows that the algorithm can recognize customers' browsing activity when evaluated in an environment different from the one on which calibration was performed. We then use the model to analyze the customers' ``browsing patterns'' on a large set of trajectories and their relation to actual purchases in the stores. Finally, we discuss how shelf browsing information could be used for retail planning and in the domain of human-robot interaction scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece3D\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u987e\u5ba2\"\u8d27\u67b6\u8bbf\u95ee\"\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u96f6\u552e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u987e\u5ba2\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5546\u5e97\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u4e1a\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u4e3b\u7406\u89e3\u987e\u5ba2\u8d2d\u7269\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u4f53\u5e97\u987e\u5ba2\u6d3b\u52a8\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6d4f\u89c8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u76843D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u9876\u7f6e\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\"\u8d27\u67b6\u8bbf\u95ee\"\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5546\u5e97\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff088138\u6761\u548c15129\u6761\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5546\u5e97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u987e\u5ba2\u6d4f\u89c8\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8d2d\u4e70\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d27\u67b6\u6d4f\u89c8\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u552e\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u96f6\u552e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u987e\u5ba2\u884c\u4e3a\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002"}}

These high-level strategies feed into a deterministic tactical module that optimises multi-leg journeys and schedules just-in-time dispatches to minimise fleet travel. Evaluation across multiple seeded runs demonstrates SmartFlows high efficacy, reducing network imbalance by over 95% while requiring minimal travel distance and achieving strong truck utilisation.

We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027transformer\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u5fc5\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d29\u6e83\"\u7684\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002ICL\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u800c\u4e0d\u66f4\u65b0\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u6307\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bf9ICL\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6743\u91cd\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027transformer\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c06\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u30022. \u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u9785\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u62df\u5408\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6570\u636e\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u30023. \u63d0\u51fa\"\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d29\u6e83\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "1.

The segmentation of liquids is difficult because liquids come in diverse appearances and shapes; moreover, they can be both transparent or reflective, taking on arbitrary objects and scenes from the background or surroundings. To take on this challenge, we construct a large-scale dataset of liquids named LQDS consisting of 5000 real-world images annotated into 14 distinct classes, and design a novel liquid detection model named LQDM, which leverages cross-attention between a dedicated boundary branch and the main segmentation branch to enhance segmentation predictions.

This study investigates quantum machine learning approaches for detecting coordinated stealth attacks on a distributed generation unit in a microgrid. High-quality simulated measurements were used to create a balanced binary classification dataset using three features: reactive power at DG1, frequency deviation relative to the nominal value, and terminal voltage magnitude. Classical machine learning baselines, fully quantum variational classifiers, and hybrid quantum classical models were evaluated. The results show that a hybrid quantum classical model combining quantum feature embeddings with a classical RBF support vector machine achieves the best overall performance on this low dimensional dataset, with a modest improvement in accuracy and F1 score over a strong classical SVM baseline. Fully quantum models perform worse due to training instability and limitations of current NISQ hardware. In contrast, hybrid models train more reliably and demonstrate that quantum feature mapping can enhance intrusion detection even when fully quantum learning is not yet practical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53d1\u7535\u5355\u5143\u534f\u540c\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165+\u7ecf\u5178RBF SVM\uff09\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u534f\u540c\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53d1\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4fee\u6539\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5374\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u521b\u5efa\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff1aDG1\u7684\u65e0\u529f\u529f\u7387\u3001\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6807\u79f0\u503c\u7684\u9891\u7387\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u7aef\u7535\u538b\u5e45\u503c\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u53d8\u5206\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178RBF\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff09\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7ecf\u5178SVM\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u9002\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5f53\u524dNISQ\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

By grounding our experiments in a realistic environment, we aimed to overcome the limitations of game-based simulations often used in prior research. We observed the comprehensive use of 25 specific persuasion techniques across most tested LLMs, encompassing a wider range than previously reported. The variations in technique usage and overall persuasion output between models highlight how different model architectures and training can impact the dynamics in realistic social simulations. Additionally, we observed unique phenomena such as \"kernel of truth\" messages and spontaneous developments with an \"ink\" obsession, where agents collectively demanded written proof.

In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating their potential in physics education by introducing a dedicated benchmark for explanatory video generation. The benchmark is designed to assess how well T2V models can convey core physics concepts through visual illustrations. Each physics concept in our benchmark is decomposed into granular teaching points, with each point accompanied by a carefully crafted prompt intended for visual explanation of the teaching point. T2V models are evaluated on their ability to generate accurate videos in response to these prompts. Our aim is to systematically explore the feasibility of using T2V models to generate high-quality, curriculum-aligned educational content-paving the way toward scalable, accessible, and personalized learning experiences powered by AI. Our evaluation reveals that current models produce visually coherent videos with smooth motion and minimal flickering, yet their conceptual accuracy is less reliable. Performance in areas such as mechanics, fluids, and optics is encouraging, but models struggle with electromagnetism and thermodynamics, where abstract interactions are harder to depict. These findings underscore the gap between visual quality and conceptual correctness in educational video generation. We hope this benchmark helps the community close that gap and move toward T2V systems that can deliver accurate, curriculum-aligned physics content at scale.

Rizki Oktavian"], "title": "LLMize: A Framework for Large Language Model-Based Numerical Optimization", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning capabilities beyond traditional language tasks, motivating their use for numerical optimization. This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning. LLMize formulates optimization as a black-box process in which candidate solutions are generated in natural language, evaluated by an external objective function, and refined over successive iterations using solution-score feedback. The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization. Results show that while LLM-based optimization is not competitive with classical solvers for simple problems, it provides a practical and accessible approach for complex, domain-specific tasks where constraints and heuristics are difficult to formalize.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMize\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90Python\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5b66\u7f16\u7a0b\u6216\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800cLLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6ce8\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "LLMize\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u89e3\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3-\u5206\u6570\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff08OPRO\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d7\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6df7\u5408LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u65c5\u884c\u5546\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u6838\u71c3\u6599\u6676\u683c\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\uff0cLLM\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u5982\u7ecf\u5178\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u96be\u4ee5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMize\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4f46\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4f7f\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach. At each hop, exploration establishes strong causal dependencies on the previous hop, while evaluation is informed by multi-path exploration feedback from subsequent hops. Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks indicate that the proposed MRE-based model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries.

The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.\n  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.\n  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time.

The method detects outliers based on vector cosine similarity, using a new dataset constructed by adding a dimension with zero values to the original data. When a point in the new dataset is selected as the measured point, an observation point is created as the origin, differing only in the new dimension by having a non-zero value compared to the measured point. Vectors are then formed from the observation point to the measured point and to other points in the dataset. By comparing the cosine similarities of these vectors, abnormal data can be identified.

This paper presents a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes AI integration across the digital twin lifecycle, spanning modeling, mirroring, intervention, and autonomous management. By synthesizing existing technologies and practices, we distill a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes how AI methodologies are embedded across the digital twin lifecycle: (1) modeling the physical twin through physics-based and physics-informed AI approaches, (2) mirroring the physical system into a digital twin with real-time synchronization, (3) intervening in the physical twin through predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and optimization strategies, and (4) achieving autonomous management through large language models, foundation models, and intelligent agents. We analyze the synergy between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, highlighting the shift from traditional numerical solvers to physics-informed and foundation models for physical systems. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI technologies, including large language models and generative world models, transform digital twins into proactive and self-improving cognitive systems capable of reasoning, communication, and creative scenario generation. Through a cross-domain review spanning eleven application domains, including healthcare, aerospace, smart manufacturing, robotics, and smart cities, we identify common challenges related to scalability, explainability, and trustworthiness, and outline directions for responsible AI-driven digital twin systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u955c\u50cf\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6b63\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684AI\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5411\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606fAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u540c\u6b65\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u955c\u50cf\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5e72\u9884\u7269\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8de811\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u534f\u540c\u548c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86AI\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u6280\u672f\u6b63\u5728\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Rather than relying on inefficient standard im2col-like implementations (e.g., spatial convolutions, depthwise convolutions and feature-shifting mechanisms) or hardware-specific CUDA kernels (e.g., deformable and neighborhood attention), which often suffer from limited portability across non-CUDA devices, we reorganize the local sampling process through a direction-based sampling perspective. Specifically, we implement a non-parametric sampling mechanism that enables dynamically varying sampling regions. This approach provides the flexibility to adapt to diverse spatial structures without the computational costs of parametric layers and the need for model retraining. To further enhance feature coherence across frames, we design a supervised spatio-temporal contrastive learning scheme that enforces consistency in feature representations. In addition, we introduce a publicly available benchmark dataset for multi-object segmentation in X-ray angiography videos (MOSXAV), featuring detailed, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Extensive experiments on the CADICA, XACV, and MOSXAV datasets show that our proposed FSVOS method outperforms current state-of-the-art video segmentation methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization capability (i.e., seen and unseen categories).

The method is motivated by structure-preserving integration and thermostat ideas from molecular dynamics, but is used here purely as an optimization heuristic.\n  We provide the algorithm and limited theoretical observations in idealized settings. On the deterministic Rosenbrock-100D benchmark with 3000 gradient evaluations, FANoS-RMS attains a mean final objective value of $1.74\\times 10^{-2}$, improving substantially over unclipped AdamW ($48.50$) and SGD+momentum ($90.76$) in this protocol.

On ill-conditioned convex quadratics and in a small PINN warm-start suite (Burgers and Allen--Cahn), the default FANoS configuration underperforms AdamW and can be unstable or high-variance.\n  Overall, the evidence supports a conservative conclusion: FANoS is an interpretable synthesis of existing ideas that can help on some stiff nonconvex valleys, but it is not a generally superior replacement for modern baselines, and its behavior is sensitive to temperature-schedule and hyperparameter choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "FANoS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001Nos\u00e9-Hoover\u6052\u6e29\u5668\u548c\u8f9b\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u6052\u6e29\u5668\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u521a\u6027\u975e\u51f8\u8c37\u5730\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u8981\u7d20\uff1a(1) \u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c(2) \u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u6807\u91cf\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u7684Nos\u00e9-Hoover\u578b\u6052\u6e29\u5668\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c(3) \u534a\u9690\u5f0f\u8f9b\u6b27\u62c9\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u9009\u5bf9\u89d2RMS\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728Rosenbrock-100D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFANoS-RMS\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u526a\u88c1\u7684AdamW\u548cSGD+momentum\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5982\u68af\u5ea6\u526a\u88c1\u7684AdamW\u548cL-BFGS\u3002\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5c0f\u578bPINN\u9884\u70ed\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFANoS\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u65b9\u5dee\u8f83\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "FANoS\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7efc\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u521a\u6027\u975e\u51f8\u8c37\u5730\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u611f\u3002"}}

In this work, we explore collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling, and demonstrate that open-source LLMs' collaboration can surpass Gemini-3-Pro. We first revisit LLM routing and aggregation at scale and identify three key bottlenecks: (1) current train-free routers are limited by a query-based paradigm focusing solely on textual similarity; (2) recent aggregation methods remain largely static, failing to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks;(3) the complementarity of routing and aggregation remains underutilized. To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines.

While AI models have achieved notable success across various scientific domains, they typically remain domain-specific or lack the capability of simultaneously understanding and generating multimodal scientific data, particularly for high-dimensional data. Yet, many pressing global challenges and scientific problems are inherently cross-disciplinary and require coordinated progress across multiple fields. Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25\u00b0 resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system.

Santamaria", "Claudia Isaza", "Jhony H. Giraldo"], "title": "WildIng: A Wildlife Image Invariant Representation Model for Geographical Domain Shift", "comment": null, "summary": "Wildlife monitoring is crucial for studying biodiversity loss and climate change. Camera trap images provide a non-intrusive method for analyzing animal populations and identifying ecological patterns over time. However, manual analysis is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning, particularly foundation models, has been applied to automate wildlife identification, achieving strong performance when tested on data from the same geographical locations as their training sets. Yet, despite their promise, these models struggle to generalize to new geographical areas, leading to significant performance drops. For example, training an advanced vision-language model, such as CLIP with an adapter, on an African dataset achieves an accuracy of 84.77%. However, this performance drops significantly to 16.17% when the model is tested on an American dataset. This limitation partly arises because existing models rely predominantly on image-based representations, making them sensitive to geographical data distribution shifts, such as variation in background, lighting, and environmental conditions. To address this, we introduce WildIng, a Wildlife image Invariant representation model for geographical domain shift. WildIng integrates text descriptions with image features, creating a more robust representation to geographical domain shifts. By leveraging textual descriptions, our approach captures consistent semantic information, such as detailed descriptions of the appearance of the species, improving generalization across different geographical locations. Experiments show that WildIng enhances the accuracy of foundation models such as BioCLIP by 30% under geographical domain shift conditions. We evaluate WildIng on two datasets collected from different regions, namely America and Africa.

However, existing benchmark frameworks still exhibit notable deficiencies in supporting cross-platform tasks in educational contexts, especially when dealing with school-specific software (such as XiaoYa Intelligent Assistant, HuaShi XiaZi, etc.), where the efficiency of agents often significantly decreases due to a lack of understanding of the structural specifics of these private-domain software. Additionally, current evaluation methods heavily rely on coarse-grained metrics like goal orientation or trajectory matching, making it challenging to capture the detailed execution and efficiency of agents in complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose KGCE (Knowledge-Augmented Dual-Graph Evaluator for Cross-Platform Educational Agent Benchmarking with Multimodal Language Models), a novel benchmarking platform that integrates knowledge base enhancement and a dual-graph evaluation framework. We first constructed a dataset comprising 104 education-related tasks, covering Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative tasks. KGCE introduces a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into multiple sub-goals and verifies their completion status, providing fine-grained evaluation metrics. To overcome the execution bottlenecks of existing agents in private-domain tasks, we developed an enhanced agent system incorporating a knowledge base specific to school-specific software.

However, existing RS VG datasets predominantly rely on explicit referring expressions-such as relative position, relative size, and color cues-thereby constraining performance on implicit VG tasks that require scenario-specific domain knowledge. This article introduces DVGBench, a high-quality implicit VG benchmark for drones, covering six major application scenarios: traffic, disaster, security, sport, social activity, and productive activity. Each object provides both explicit and implicit queries. Based on the dataset, we design DroneVG-R1, an LVLM that integrates the novel Implicit-to-Explicit Chain-of-Thought (I2E-CoT) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. This enables the model to take advantage of scene-specific expertise, converting implicit references into explicit ones and thus reducing grounding difficulty. Finally, an evaluation of mainstream models on both explicit and implicit VG tasks reveals substantial limitations in their reasoning capabilities. These findings provide actionable insights for advancing the reasoning capacity of LVLMs for drone-based agents.

However, effectively training large diffusion policies using reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIPOLE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578bRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u8d2a\u5a6a\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff08\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u65af\u4f3c\u7136\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIPOLE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u56de\u5f52\u76ee\u6807\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d2a\u5a6a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff1b3) \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u4e8c\u5206\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5206\u6570\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d2a\u5a6a\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728ExORL\u548cOGBench\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebfRL\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728NAVSIM\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cAD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "DIPOLE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, compared with large language models, SLMs are more prone to factual hallucinations in reasoning and exhibit weaker classification performance. This raises a natural question: Can mitigating factual hallucinations improve SLMs' financial classification? To address this, we propose a three-step pipeline named AAAI (Association Identification, Automated Detection, and Adaptive Inference). Experiments on three representative SLMs reveal that: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications; (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations; and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables SLMs' adaptive inference that enhances classification performance. We hope this pipeline contributes to trustworthy and effective applications of SLMs in finance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAAAI\u4e09\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(SLMs)\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u548c\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u800c\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e14\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u80fd\u5426\u6539\u5584SLMs\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\uff1f", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aAAAI\u7684\u4e09\u6b65\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a1) \u5173\u8054\u8bc6\u522b(Association Identification)\uff0c2) \u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b(Automated Detection)\uff0c3) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406(Adaptive Inference)\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027SLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AAAI\u7ba1\u9053\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SLMs\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aSLMs\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

LCA employs adaptive one dimensional convolutions with grouped operations to reduce parameter usage while preserving effective attention behavior. Experimental results show that LCA achieves competitive accuracy, reaching 94.68 percent on ResNet 18 and 93.10 percent on MobileNetV2, while matching ECA in parameter efficiency and maintaining favorable inference latency.

We study this using COVID-19 as a natural experiment across 8 supply chain tasks. Despite identical severe feature turnover (Jaccard approximately 0), coverage drops vary from 0% to 86.7%, spanning two orders of magnitude. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, we find catastrophic failures correlate with single-feature dependence (rho = 0.714, p = 0.047). Catastrophic tasks concentrate importance in one feature (4.5x increase), while robust tasks redistribute across many (10-20x). Quarterly retraining restores catastrophic task coverage from 22% to 41% (+19 pp, p = 0.04), but provides no benefit for robust tasks (99.8% coverage). Exploratory analysis of 4 additional tasks with moderate feature stability (Jaccard 0.13-0.86) reveals feature stability, not concentration, determines robustness, suggesting concentration effects apply specifically to severe shifts.

In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method.

We study a generative modeling approach for producing new realizations from a limited set of available runs by transferring structure learned across an ensemble. Using monthly near-surface temperature time series from ten independent reanalysis realizations (ERA5), we find that a vanilla conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained jointly across realizations yields a fragmented latent space that fails to generalize to unseen ensemble members. To address this, we introduce a latent-constrained CVAE (LC-CVAE) that enforces cross-realization homogeneity of latent embeddings at a small set of shared geographic 'anchor' locations. We then use multi-output Gaussian process regression in the latent space to predict latent coordinates at unsampled locations in a new realization, followed by decoding to generate full time series fields.

While traditional econometric methods struggle when these confounders are orthogonal to structured covariates, high-dimensional unstructured text often contains rich proxies for these latent variables. This study proposes a Neural Network-Enhanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework designed to leverage text embeddings for causal identification. Using a rigorous synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate that unstructured text embeddings capture critical confounding information that is absent from structured tabular data. However, we show that standard tree-based DML estimators retain substantial bias (+24%) due to their inability to model the continuous topology of embedding manifolds. In contrast, our deep learning approach reduces bias to -0.86% with optimized architectures, effectively recovering the ground-truth causal parameter.

Previous methods address these challenges through local alignment, yet they are often prone to shortcut learning and spurious correlations, yielding misalignment. Moreover, injecting prior knowledge can distort intra-modality structure. Motivated by our finding that encoder attention surfaces spatially precise evidence from the earliest training epochs, and to alleviate these issues, we introduceITSELF, an attention-guided framework for implicit local alignment. At its core, Guided Representation with Attentive Bank (GRAB) converts the model's own attention into an Attentive Bank of high-saliency tokens and applies local objectives on this bank, learning fine-grained correspondences without extra supervision. To make the selection reliable and non-redundant, we introduce Multi-Layer Attention for Robust Selection (MARS), which aggregates attention across layers and performs diversity-aware top-k selection; and Adaptive Token Scheduler (ATS), which schedules the retention budget from coarse to fine over training, preserving context early while progressively focusing on discriminative details. Extensive experiments on three widely used TBPS benchmarks showstate-of-the-art performance and strong cross-dataset generalization, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of our approach without additional prior supervision.

However, despite its power, the standard attention mechanism is plagued by well-documented issues: representational collapse and attention sink. Although prior work has proposed approaches for these issues, they are often studied in isolation, obscuring their deeper connection. In this paper, we present a unified perspective, arguing that both can be traced to a common root -- improper attention allocation. We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu corpus, evaluated across nine diverse benchmarks, demonstrate that Lazy Attention successfully mitigates attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58% attention sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLazy Attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fc7\u8f7d\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6b20\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u574d\u7f29\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0b\u6c89\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe59.58%\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u7136\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u574d\u7f29\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0b\u6c89\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5f80\u5f80\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u5171\u540c\u7684\u6839\u6e90\u2014\u2014\u4e0d\u6070\u5f53\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLazy Attention\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) \u9488\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u5934\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u533a\u5206\u6765\u589e\u5f3atoken\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u9488\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6b20\u8f7d\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Elastic-Softmax\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u653e\u677e\u6807\u51c6softmax\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u5bf9\u65e0\u5173token\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5728FineWeb-Edu\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLazy Attention\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0b\u6c89\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe59.58%\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Lazy Attention\u4e3aTransformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fc7\u8f7d\u548c\u6b20\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u574d\u7f29\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0b\u6c89\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u805a\u7126\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002"}}

The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds \"confidence,\" and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives.

In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points).

However, existing approaches often struggle to balance efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, particularly when handling long-range dependencies and irregularly sampled data. To address these challenges, we propose MODE, a unified framework that integrates Low-Rank Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with an Enhanced Mamba architecture. As illustrated in our framework, the input sequence is first transformed by a Linear Tokenization Layer and then processed through multiple Mamba Encoder blocks, each equipped with an Enhanced Mamba Layer that employs Causal Convolution, SiLU activation, and a Low-Rank Neural ODE enhancement to efficiently capture temporal dynamics. This low-rank formulation reduces computational overhead while maintaining expressive power. Furthermore, a segmented selective scanning mechanism, inspired by pseudo-ODE dynamics, adaptively focuses on salient subsequences to improve scalability and long-range sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODE surpasses existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, our contributions include: (1) a unified and efficient architecture for long-term time series modeling, (2) integration of Mamba's selective scanning with low-rank Neural ODEs for enhanced temporal representation, and (3) substantial improvements in efficiency and scalability enabled by low-rank approximation and dynamic selective scanning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MODE\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u795e\u7ecfODE\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3aMamba\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMODE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u7ebf\u6027\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b2) \u591a\u4e2a\u589e\u5f3aMamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5757\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u56e0\u679c\u5377\u79ef\u3001SiLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u795e\u7ecfODE\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b3) \u5206\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u626b\u63cf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f2aODE\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMODE\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "MODE\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u9ad8\u6548\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u795e\u7ecfODE\u4e0eMamba\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u626b\u63cf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027"}}

Static benchmarks measure knowledge breadth but fail to quantify the depth of belief. While Simhi et al. (2025) defined the CHOKE phenomenon in standard QA, we extend this framework to quantify \"Cognitive Conviction\" in System 2 reasoning models. We propose Project Aletheia, a cognitive physics framework that employs Tikhonov Regularization to invert the judge's confusion matrix. To validate this methodology without relying on opaque private data, we implement a Synthetic Proxy Protocol.

This exclusion arises from the inherent ill-posed nature of 3D estimation from monocular image, which introduces instability during training. Consequently, high-quality 3D predictions can be erroneously suppressed by 2D-only matching criteria, leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose Mono3DV, a novel Transformer-based framework. Our approach introduces three key innovations. First, we develop a 3D-Aware Bipartite Matching strategy that directly incorporates 3D geometric information into the matching cost, resolving the misalignment caused by purely 2D criteria. Second, it is important to stabilize the Bipartite Matching to resolve the instability occurring when integrating 3D attributes. Therefore, we propose 3D-DeNoising scheme in the training phase. Finally, recognizing the gradient vanishing issue associated with conventional denoising techniques, we propose a novel Variational Query DeNoising mechanism to overcome this limitation, which significantly enhances model performance.

This motivates predictive modelling of muscle outcomes from minimally invasive biomarkers that can be acquired longitudinally. We study a small-sample preclinical dataset comprising 213 animals across two conditions (Sham versus cigarette-smoke exposure), with blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid measurements and three continuous targets: tibialis anterior muscle weight (milligram: mg), specific force (millinewton: mN), and a derived muscle quality index (mN per mg). We benchmark tuned classical baselines, geometry-aware symmetric positive definite (SPD) descriptors with Stein divergence, and quantum kernel models designed for low-dimensional tabular data. In the muscle-weight setting, quantum kernel ridge regression using four interpretable inputs (blood C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and condition) attains a test root mean squared error of 4.41 mg and coefficient of determination of 0.605, improving over a matched ridge baseline on the same feature set (4.70 mg and 0.553). Geometry-informed Stein-divergence prototype distances yield a smaller but consistent gain in the biomarker-only setting (4.55 mg versus 4.79 mg). Screening-style evaluation, obtained by thresholding the continuous outcome at 0.8 times the training Sham mean, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of up to 0.90 for detecting low muscle weight.

We propose a two-stage framework for improving behavioral alignment. The first stage, context formation, explicitly specifies the experimental design to establish an accurate representation of the decision task and its context. The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation. Our findings clarify when each stage is necessary and provide a systematic approach for designing and diagnosing LLM social simulations as complements to human subjects in behavioral research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u6539\u5584LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f62\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u660e\u786e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bfc\u822a\u9636\u6bb5\u6307\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u53ea\u9700\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u4ed6\u4eba\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u884c\u4e3a\u5f62\u6210\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u504f\u79bb\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f62\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\uff1b2) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bfc\u822a\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u8be5\u8868\u5f81\u5185\u6307\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u505a\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aSOTA\u6a21\u578b(GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1)\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u9700\u8981\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f62\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f55\u65f6\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bca\u65adLLM\u793e\u4f1a\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The root cause lies in the high diversity of artifact distributions introduced by different forgery methods, while pretrained models tend to disrupt their original general semantic structures when adapting to new artifacts. Existing approaches usually rely on indiscriminate global parameter updates or introduce additional supervision signals, making it difficult to effectively model diverse forgery artifacts while preserving semantic stability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deepfake detection method based on Multi-Artifact Subspaces and selective layer masks (MASM), which explicitly decouples semantic representations from artifact representations and constrains the fitting strength of artifact subspaces, thereby improving generalization robustness in cross-dataset scenarios. Specifically, MASM applies singular value decomposition to model weights, partitioning pretrained weights into a stable semantic principal subspace and multiple learnable artifact subspaces. This design enables decoupled modeling of different forgery artifact patterns while preserving the general semantic subspace. On this basis, a selective layer mask strategy is introduced to adaptively regulate the update behavior of corresponding network layers according to the learning state of each artifact subspace, suppressing overfitting to any single forgery characteristic. Furthermore, orthogonality constraints and spectral consistency constraints are imposed to jointly regularize multiple artifact subspaces, guiding them to learn complementary and diverse artifact representations while maintaining a stable overall spectral structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u4f2a\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u5206\u5e03\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4f2a\u5f71\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u7834\u574f\u539f\u6709\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u4f2a\u5f71\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMASM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u76f8\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3) \u65bd\u52a0\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u4e2a\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e92\u8865\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u62df\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MASM\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u540c\u4f2a\u9020\u4f2a\u5f71\u6a21\u5f0f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u4f2a\u9020\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002"}}

Logics-STEM targets reasoning tasks in the domains of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and exhibits exceptional performance on STEM-related benchmarks with an average improvement of 4.68% over the next-best model at 8B scale. We attribute the gains to our data-algorithm co-design engine, where they are jointly optimized to fit a gold-standard distribution behind reasoning. Data-wise, the Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset is constructed from a meticulously designed data curation engine with 5 stages to ensure the quality, diversity, and scalability, including annotation, deduplication, decontamination, distillation, and stratified sampling. Algorithm-wise, our failure-driven post-training framework leverages targeted knowledge retrieval and data synthesis around model failure regions in the Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) stage to effectively guide the second-stage SFT or the reinforcement learning (RL) for better fitting the target distribution. The superior empirical performance of Logics-STEM reveals the vast potential of combining large-scale open-source data with carefully designed synthetic data, underscoring the critical role of data-algorithm co-design in enhancing reasoning capabilities through post-training. We make both the Logics-STEM models (8B and 32B) and the Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset (10M and downsampled 2.2M versions) publicly available to support future research in the open-source community.", "AI": {"tldr": "Logics-STEM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u572810M\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8eSTEM\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u57288B\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53474.68%\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u7b97\u6cd5\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347STEM\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u7b97\u6cd5\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa10M\u89c4\u6a21\u7684Logics-STEM-SFT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u75285\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u786e\u4fdd\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5931\u8d25\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728SFT\u9636\u6bb5\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5SFT\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u62df\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728STEM\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\uff0c8B\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53474.68%\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Logics-STEM\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7b97\u6cd5\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u793e\u533a\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Although transfer learning is commonly used for predicting body weight from images, its effectiveness and optimal fine-tuning strategies remain poorly understood in livestock applications, particularly beyond the use of pretrained ImageNet or COCO weights. In addition, while both depth images and three-dimensional point-cloud data have been explored for body weight prediction, direct comparisons of these two modalities in dairy cattle are limited. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate whether transfer learning from a large farm enhances body weight prediction on a small farm with limited data, and 2) compare the predictive performance of depth-image- and point-cloud-based approaches under three experimental designs. Top-view depth images and point-cloud data were collected from 1,201, 215, and 58 cows at large, medium, and small dairy farms, respectively. Four deep learning models were evaluated: ConvNeXt and MobileViT for depth images, and PointNet and DGCNN for point clouds. Transfer learning markedly improved body weight prediction on the small farm across all four models, outperforming single-source learning and achieving gains comparable to or greater than joint learning. These results indicate that pretrained representations generalize well across farms with differing imaging conditions and dairy cattle populations. No consistent performance difference was observed between depth-image- and point-cloud-based models. Overall, these findings suggest that transfer learning is well suited for small farm prediction scenarios where cross-farm data sharing is limited by privacy, logistical, or policy constraints, as it requires access only to pretrained model weights rather than raw data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u519c\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3a\u5976\u725b\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u755c\u7267\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5927\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u5c0f\u4e09\u4e2a\u5976\u725b\u573a\u6536\u96c6\u4e861,201\u3001215\u548c58\u5934\u5976\u725b\u7684\u4fef\u89c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff1aConvNeXt\u548cMobileViT\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\uff0cPointNet\u548cDGCNN\u7528\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5355\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u519c\u573a\u7684\u4f53\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5c0f\u519c\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8de8\u519c\u573a\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u7269\u6d41\u6216\u653f\u7b56\u9650\u5236\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u519c\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5976\u725b\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches rely on procedural JSON-based function calling, which often struggles with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift. In this paper, we present CaveAgent, a framework that transforms the paradigm from \"LLM-as-Text-Generator\" to \"LLM-as-Runtime-Operator.\" We introduce a Dual-stream Context Architecture that decouples state management into a lightweight semantic stream for reasoning and a persistent, deterministic Python Runtime stream for execution. In addition to leveraging code generation to efficiently resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, we introduce \\textit{Stateful Runtime Management} in CaveAgent. Distinct from existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound and lack the support for external object injection and retrieval, CaveAgent injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns. This persistence mechanism acts as a high-fidelity external memory to eliminate context drift, avoid catastrophic forgetting, while ensuring that processed data flows losslessly to downstream applications. Comprehensive evaluations on Tau$^2$-bench, BFCL and various case studies across representative SOTA LLMs demonstrate CaveAgent's superiority. Specifically, our framework achieves a 10.5\\% success rate improvement on retail tasks and reduces total token consumption by 28.4\\% in multi-turn scenarios.

We operate under a full-bandit feedback model, where only the influence of the chosen seed set at each time step is observed, with no additional structural information about the network or diffusion process. It is well-established that the influence function is submodular, and existing algorithms exploit this property to achieve low regret. In this work, we leverage this property further and propose the Lazy Online Forward Algorithm (LOFA), which achieves a lower empirical regret.

Applying rules to such inputs demands both interpretive flexibility and formal guarantees. Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1aLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672c\u4f53\u586b\u5145\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aABox\u65ad\u8a00\uff0cSWRL\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u5219\u5e94\u7528\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u4e34\u5e8a\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bc1\u636e\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u6807\u51c6\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e2\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53c8\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1aLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672c\u4f53\u586b\u5145\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f16\u5199\u7684TBox\u89c4\u8303\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aABox\u65ad\u8a00\uff0cSWRL\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u65ad\u8a00\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u4e8eOWL 2\u672c\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f20\u95fb\u786e\u5b9a\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8d44\u683c\uff09\u548c11\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u6bd4few-shot\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u90fd\u6709\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u8ba4\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6bd4\u4ec5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u597d\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LLM\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u586b\u5145\u7684ABox\u53ef\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u4e49\u7f51\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This study evaluates the classification performance of machine learning and deep learning models on the LC25000 dataset, which includes five classes of histopathological images. We used the fine-tuned InceptionResNet-v2 network both as a classifier and for feature extraction. Our results show that the fine-tuned InceptionResNet-v2 achieved a classification accuracy of 96.01\\% and an average AUC of 96.8\\%.

While conditional computation enables substantial gains in computational efficiency, it remains unclear whether the interaction between sparse routing and temperature-based sampling compromises output stability relative to dense architectures. This work investigates whether conditional computation in MoE models amplifies decoding-induced randomness, leading to reduced reliability as temperature increases. We evaluate three representative models: OLMoE-7B (sparse base), Mixtral-8x7B (sparse instruction-tuned), and Qwen2.5-3B (dense instruction-tuned) on deterministic arithmetic reasoning tasks with objectively verifiable answers. Experiments span four decoding configurations, ranging from greedy decoding to T=1.0. Our evaluation encompasses accuracy, format compliance, output consistency across repeated generations, and confidence metrics, totaling 9,360 model generations. Results demonstrate that the sparse instruction-tuned model exhibits stability comparable to the dense instruction-tuned model across all decoding temperatures, while the sparse base model shows systematic degradation as temperature increases. These findings indicate that instruction tuning, rather than architectural sparsity, is the primary determinant of robustness to decoding randomness on deterministic tasks. We discuss the implications of these results for deploying sparse language models in reliability-critical applications, highlighting scenarios in which sparse architectures can be safely adopted without sacrificing output stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7a00\u758fMoE\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u968f\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u800c\u975e\u67b6\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u968f\u673a\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7a00\u758f\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6(MoE)\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u968f\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6761\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u7a00\u758f\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff1aOLMoE-7B\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3001Mixtral-8x7B\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548cQwen2.5-3B\uff08\u5bc6\u96c6\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5ba2\u89c2\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u4ece\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u5230T=1.0\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u603b\u8ba19,360\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u7a00\u758f\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7a00\u758f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u968f\u7740\u6e29\u5ea6\u5347\u9ad8\u51fa\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9000\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u800c\u975e\u67b6\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u968f\u673a\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u786e\u4fdd\u7a00\u758f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7a00\u758f\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b89\u5168\u91c7\u7528\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8f93\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, efficiently reconstructing hyperspectral images from compressive sensing measurements presents significant challenges. To tackle these, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that capitalizes on the unique spectral and spatial characteristics of hyperspectral images. We introduce the Lightweight Separate Spectral Transformer (LSST), an innovative architecture tailored for efficient hyperspectral image reconstruction. This architecture consists of Separate Spectral Transformer Blocks (SSTB) for modeling spectral relationships and Lightweight Spatial Convolution Blocks (LSCB) for spatial processing. The SSTB employs Grouped Spectral Self-attention and a Spectrum Shuffle operation to effectively manage both local and non-local spectral relationships. Simultaneously, the LSCB utilizes depth-wise separable convolutions and strategic ordering to enhance spatial information processing. Furthermore, we implement the Focal Spectrum Loss, a novel loss weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts during training to improve reconstruction across spectrally complex bands. Extensive testing demonstrates that our LSST achieves superior performance while requiring fewer FLOPs and parameters, underscoring its efficiency and effectiveness.

We investigate Open-Set Recognition (OSR) for text by porting the feature attenuation hypothesis from computer vision to transformers and by benchmarking it against state-of-the-art baselines. Concretely, we adapt the COSTARR framework--originally designed for classification in computer vision--to two modest language models (BERT (base) and GPT-2) trained to label 176 arXiv subject areas. Alongside COSTARR, we evaluate Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP), MaxLogit, and the temperature-scaled free-energy score under the OOSA and AUOSCR metrics. Our results show (i) COSTARR extends to NLP without retraining but yields no statistically significant gain over MaxLogit or MSP, and (ii) free-energy lags behind all other scores in this high-class-count setting. The study highlights both the promise and the current limitations of transplanting vision-centric OSR ideas to language models, and points toward the need for larger backbones and task-tailored attenuation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8870\u51cf\u5047\u8bbe\u79fb\u690d\u5230Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86COSTARR\u6846\u67b6\u5728BERT\u548cGPT-2\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728NLP\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u884c\u4f46\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u5982BERT\uff09\u5728\u95ed\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72NLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684COSTARR\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u914d\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08BERT-base\u548cGPT-2\uff09\uff0c\u5728176\u4e2aarXiv\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86MSP\u3001MaxLogit\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u5206\u6570\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528OOSA\u548cAUOSCR\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "1) COSTARR\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230NLP\u9886\u57df\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u6bd4MaxLogit\u6216MSP\u6ca1\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b2) \u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u5206\u6570\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7c7b\u522b\u6570\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\uff0c\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u601d\u60f3\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In this paper, we identify a connection between interpretability and robustness that can be directly leveraged during training. Specifically, we observe that spurious, unstable, or semantically irrelevant features identified through Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) contribute disproportionately to adversarial vulnerability. Building on this insight, we introduce an attribution-guided refinement framework that transforms LIME from a passive diagnostic into an active training signal. Our method systematically suppresses spurious features using feature masking, sensitivity-aware regularization, and adversarial augmentation in a closed-loop refinement pipeline. This approach does not require additional datasets or model architectures and integrates seamlessly into standard adversarial training. Theoretically, we derive an attribution-aware lower bound on adversarial distortion that formalizes the link between explanation alignment and robustness.

Our approach is built upon a novel watermark definition that leverages patch-level luminance statistics. Specifically, the service provider predefines a binary pattern together with corresponding patch-level thresholds. To detect a watermark in a given image, we evaluate whether the luminance of each patch surpasses its threshold and then verify whether the resulting binary pattern aligns with the target one. A simple statistical analysis demonstrates that the false positive rate of the proposed method can be effectively controlled, thereby ensuring certified detection. To enable seamless watermark injection across different paradigms, we leverage the widely adopted guidance technique as a plug-and-play mechanism and develop the \\emph{watermark guidance}. This design enables Luminark to achieve generality across state-of-the-art generative models without compromising image quality.

Motivated by these challenges, we propose the first practical univariate time series simulation pipeline which is simultaneously fast enough for on-the-fly data generation and enables notable zero-shot forecasting performance on M-Series and GiftEval benchmarks that capture trend/seasonality/intermittency patterns, typical of industrial forecasting applications across a variety of domains. Our simulator, which we call SarSim0 (SARIMA Simulator for Zero-Shot Forecasting), is based off of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model as its core data source. Due to instability in the autoregressive component, naive SARIMA simulation often leads to unusable paths. Instead, we follow a three-step procedure: (1) we sample well-behaved trajectories from its characteristic polynomial stability region; (2) we introduce a superposition scheme that combines multiple paths into rich multi-seasonality traces; and (3) we add rate-based heavy-tailed noise models to capture burstiness and intermittency alongside seasonalities and trends. SarSim0 is orders of magnitude faster than kernel-based generators, and it enables training on circa 1B unique purely simulated series, generated on the fly; after which well-established neural network backbones exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing strong statistical forecasters and recent foundation baselines, while operating under strict zero-shot protocol. Notably, on GiftEval we observe a \"student-beats-teacher\" effect: models trained on our simulations exceed the forecasting accuracy of the AutoARIMA generating processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSarSim0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSARIMA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6b65\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u591a\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728M-Series\u548cGiftEval\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6613\u6cc4\u9732\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8bb8\u53ef\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSARIMA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u6b65\u6a21\u62df\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1)\u4ece\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u91c7\u6837\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2)\u901a\u8fc7\u53e0\u52a0\u65b9\u6848\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b3)\u6dfb\u52a0\u57fa\u4e8e\u901f\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u548c\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u3002", "result": "SarSim0\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u7ea610\u4ebf\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u6a21\u62df\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u7edf\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728GiftEval\u4e0a\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0bAutoARIMA\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SarSim0\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We systematically evaluate whether Large Language Models can solve these equations through direct numerical prediction or whether a hybrid architecture combining LLM symbolic manipulation with classical iterative solvers proves more effective. Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition.

However, the same score-based SDE modeling that grants diffusion policies the flexibility to learn diverse behavior also incurs solver and score-matching errors, large data requirements, and inconsistencies in action generation. While less critical in image generation, these inaccuracies compound and lead to failure in continuous control settings. We introduce Contractive Diffusion Policies (CDPs) to induce contractive behavior in the diffusion sampling dynamics. Contraction pulls nearby flows closer to enhance robustness against solver and score-matching errors while reducing unwanted action variance. We develop an in-depth theoretical analysis along with a practical implementation recipe to incorporate CDPs into existing diffusion policy architectures with minimal modification and computational cost. We evaluate CDPs for offline learning by conducting extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings.

True narrative understanding requires grounding who is doing what, when, and where, maintaining coherent entity representations across dynamic visual and temporal contexts. We introduce NarrativeTrack, the first benchmark to evaluate narrative understanding in MLLMs through fine-grained entity-centric reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks limited to short clips or coarse scene-level semantics, we decompose videos into constituent entities and examine their continuity via a Compositional Reasoning Progression (CRP), a structured evaluation framework that progressively increases narrative complexity across three dimensions: entity existence, entity changes, and entity ambiguity. CRP challenges models to advance from temporal persistence to contextual evolution and fine-grained perceptual reasoning. A fully automated entity-centric pipeline enables scalable extraction of temporally grounded entity representations, providing the foundation for CRP. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that models fail to robustly track entities across visual transitions and temporal dynamics, often hallucinating identity under context shifts. Open-source general-purpose MLLMs exhibit strong perceptual grounding but weak temporal coherence, while video-specific MLLMs capture temporal context yet hallucinate entity's contexts. These findings uncover a fundamental trade-off between perceptual grounding and temporal reasoning, indicating that narrative understanding emerges only from their integration.

This is critical for assessing the service life of civil infrastructure subjected to aggressive environments. The adopted methodology relies on several simple and complex standalone machine learning (ML) algorithms, with the primary objective of establishing confidence in the unbiased prediction of the underlying hidden correlations. The simple algorithms include linear regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The complex algorithms entail support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and two families of artificial neural networks, including a feedforward network (multilayer perceptron, MLP) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The MLP architecture cannot explicitly handle sequential data, a limitation addressed by the GRU. A comprehensive dataset is considered. The performance of ML algorithms is evaluated, with KRR, GPR, and MLP exhibiting high accuracy. Given the diversity of the adopted concrete mixture proportions, the GRU was unable to accurately reproduce the response in the test set. Further analyses elucidate the contributions of mixture compositions to the temporal evolution of chloride. The results obtained from the GPR model unravel latent correlations through clear and explainable trends. The MLP, SVR, and KRR also provide acceptable estimates of the overall trends. The majority of mixture components exhibit an inverse relation with chloride content, while a few components demonstrate a direct correlation. These findings highlight the potential of surrogate approaches for describing the physical processes involved in chloride ingress and the associated correlations, toward the ultimate goal of enhancing the service life of civil infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u4e2d\u6c2f\u79bb\u5b50\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u6210\u5206\u5bf9\u6c2f\u79bb\u5b50\u4fb5\u8680\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5ef6\u957f\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4f7f\u7528\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u4fb5\u8680\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u6c2f\u79bb\u5b50\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u4e0e\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u6210\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8010\u4e45\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u3001KNN\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u6838\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u6838\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u6210\u5206\u4e0e\u6c2f\u79bb\u5b50\u542b\u91cf\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u6210\u5206\u4e0e\u6c2f\u79bb\u5b50\u4fb5\u8680\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5ef6\u957f\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4f7f\u7528\u5bff\u547d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66ff\u4ee3\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Decision-theoretic alignment under uncertainty", "summary": "This paper introduces Admissibility Alignment: a reframing of AI alignment as a property of admissible action and decision selection over distributions of outcomes under uncertainty, evaluated through the behavior of candidate policies. We present MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) as a canonical system architecture for operationalizing admissibility alignment, formalizing alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property rather than a static or binary condition.\n  MAP-AI, a new control-plane system architecture for aligned decision-making under uncertainty, enforces alignment through Monte Carlo estimation of outcome distributions and admissibility-controlled policy selection rather than static model-level constraints. The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events. Finally, we show how distributional alignment evaluation can be integrated into decision-making itself, yielding an admissibility-controlled action selection mechanism that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u53ef\u91c7\u7eb3\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\"\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u91c7\u7eb3\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u9009\u62e9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecdMAP-AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u9009\u62e9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u6216\u4e8c\u5143\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u653f\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAP-AI\uff08\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u5bf9\u9f50\u653f\u7b56\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u53ef\u91c7\u7eb3\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u653f\u7b56\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u5b9e\u65bd\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u51b3\u7b56\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u6027\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff08\u671f\u671b\u6548\u7528\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6982\u7387\uff09\u800c\u975e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6216\u6392\u540d\u6027\u80fd\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f01\u4e1aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u7531\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u51b3\u5b9a\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u53ef\u91c7\u7eb3\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6539\u53d8\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

The results show that deeper CNN architectures provide substantial performance gains on fine-grained multiclass datasets, while lightweight pretrained and transfer learning models remain highly effective for simpler binary classification tasks. Additionally, we extend the proposed architecture to an object detection setting, demonstrating its adaptability in identifying unauthorized auto-rickshaws in real-world traffic scenes.

Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT). Our analysis predicts that enforcing geometric validity while allowing dynamic erasure is essential for avoiding rank collapse in ultra-deep networks. We outline an evaluation protocol for Transformers exceeding 100 layers to test the hypothesis that geometry, rather than depth itself, is the key limiting factor in deep representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df1\u5ea6Transformer\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u793a\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u63d0\u51faManifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT)\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06Transformer\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u5931\u8d25\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8868\u793a\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6df1\u5ea6Transformer\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u539f\u5219\uff1a1) \u6d41\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u8d85\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5207\u5411\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6d41\u5f62\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b2) \u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u64e6\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faManifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u5f81\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u5f3a\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u52a8\u6001\u64e6\u9664\u5bf9\u907f\u514d\u8d85\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u79e9\u5d29\u6e83\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6Transformer\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5ea6\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u64e6\u9664\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8868\u793a\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5ea6\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

The proposed model introduces (i) a combined loss term aligning the global color statistics through differentiable histogram matching, perceptual image quality measure, and feature based similarity to preserve texture information, (ii) local hue-saturation priors injected via Spatially Adaptive Denormalization (SPADE) to stabilize chromatic reconstruction, and (iii) texture-aware supervision within a Mamba backbone to preserve fine details. We introduce an adaptive-resolution inference engine that further enables high-resolution translation without sacrificing quality. Our proposed NIR-to-RGB translation model simultaneously enforces global color statistics and local chromatic consistency, while scaling to native resolutions without compromising texture fidelity or generalization. Extensive evaluations on FANVID, OMSIV, VCIP2020, and RGB2NIR using different evaluation metrics demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baseline methods.

We further explore the role of RFT in model training behavior using Frequency Principle (F-Principle) analysis and show that models with RFT turn to learn low frequency and high frequency at the same time, whereas conventional DNNs start from low frequency and gradually learn (if successful) high-frequency features. We focus on reconstruction-based anomaly detection using autoencoder and variational autoencoder and investigate the RFT's role. We also introduced a trainable variant of RFT that uses the existing computation graph to train the expansion of RFT instead of it being random. We showcase our findings with two low-dimensional synthetic datasets for data representation, and an aviation safety dataset, called Dashlink, for high-dimensional reconstruction-based anomaly detection.

We introduce an end-to-end framework for clinical KG construction and evaluation directly from free text using multi-agent prompting and a schema-constrained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) strategy. Our pipeline integrates (1) prompt-driven entity, attribute, and relation extraction; (2) entropy-based uncertainty scoring; (3) ontology-aligned RDF/OWL schema generation; and (4) multi-LLM consensus validation for hallucination detection and semantic refinement. Beyond static graph construction, the framework supports continuous refinement and self-supervised evaluation, enabling iterative improvement of graph quality. Applied to two oncology cohorts (PDAC and BRCA), our method produces interpretable, SPARQL-compatible, and clinically grounded knowledge graphs without relying on gold-standard annotations.

Current coordinate-guided low-resolution feature interpolation methods, e.g., bilinear interpolation, produce coarse high-resolution features which suffer from feature misalignment and insufficient context information. Moreover, enriching semantics to high-resolution features requires a high computation burden, so that it is challenging to meet the requirement of lowlatency inference. We propose a novel Guided Attentive Interpolation (GAI) method to adaptively interpolate fine-grained high-resolution features with semantic features to tackle these issues. Guided Attentive Interpolation determines both spatial and semantic relations of pixels from features of different resolutions and then leverages these relations to interpolate high-resolution features with rich semantics. GAI can be integrated with any deep convolutional network for efficient semantic segmentation.

Developing deep learning models for approximating their solution operators promises not only fast, practical solvers, but may also inspire models that resolve classical learning tasks from a new perspective. In this work, we build on classical Wiener chaos expansions (WCE) to design neural operator (NO) architectures for SPDEs and SDEs: we project the driving noise paths onto orthonormal Wick Hermite features and parameterize the resulting deterministic chaos coefficients with neural operators, so that full solution trajectories can be reconstructed from noise in a single forward pass. On the theoretical side, we investigate the classical WCE results for the class of multi-dimensional SDEs and semilinear SPDEs considered here by explicitly writing down the associated coupled ODE/PDE systems for their chaos coefficients, which makes the separation between stochastic forcing and deterministic dynamics fully explicit and directly motivates our model designs. On the empirical side, we validate our models on a diverse suite of problems: classical SPDE benchmarks, diffusion one-step sampling on images, topological interpolation on graphs, financial extrapolation, parameter estimation, and manifold SDEs for flood prediction, demonstrating competitive accuracy and broad applicability. Overall, our results indicate that WCE-based neural operators provide a practical and scalable way to learn SDE/SPDE solution operators across diverse domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWiener\u6df7\u6c8c\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u968f\u673a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6b63\u4ea4Wick-Hermite\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u968f\u673a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u662f\u5efa\u6a21\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5176\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u4ece\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u542f\u53d1\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178Wiener\u6df7\u6c8c\u5c55\u5f00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5c06\u9a71\u52a8\u566a\u58f0\u8def\u5f84\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6b63\u4ea4Wick-Hermite\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\uff0c\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u4e2d\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u91cd\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4SDE\u548c\u534a\u7ebf\u6027SPDE\u7684WCE\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5199\u51fa\u5176\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u8026\u5408ODE/PDE\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7ecf\u5178SPDE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u4e00\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u63d2\u503c\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u5916\u63a8\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6d41\u5f62SDE\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eWiener\u6df7\u6c8c\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60SDE/SPDE\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback. The experiments show a 20 percent improvement in task accuracy, along with a reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures.

We aimed to develop a unified AI framework, CardioMOD-Net, to perform multiclass diagnosis and continuous prediction of HFpEF onset directly from standard echocardiography cine loops in preclinical models.\n  Methods: Mouse echocardiography videos from four groups were used: control (CTL), hyperglycaemic (HG), obesity (OB), and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). Two-dimensional parasternal long-axis cine loops were decomposed using Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to extract temporal features for downstream analysis. A shared latent representation supported Vision Transformers, one for a classifier for diagnosis and another for a regression module for predicting the age at HFpEF onset.\n  Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy across the four groups was 65%, with all classes exceeding 50% accuracy. Misclassifications primarily reflected early-stage overlap between OB or SAH and CTL. The prognostic module achieved a root-mean-square error of 21.72 weeks for time-to-HFpEF prediction, with OB and SAH showing the most accurate estimates. Predicted HFpEF onset closely matched true distributions in all groups.\n  Discussion: This unified framework demonstrates that multiclass phenotyping and continuous HFpEF onset prediction can be obtained from a single cine loop, even under small-data conditions. The approach offers a foundation for integrating diagnostic and prognostic modelling in preclinical HFpEF research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CardioMOD-Net AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5c0f\u9f20\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884cHFpEF\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u6d4b\u75be\u75c5\u53d1\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4", "motivation": "HFpEF\u75c5\u56e0\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u8fdb\u5c55\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AI\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8c\u5143\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u75c5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u9f20\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4bHFpEF\u53d1\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4", "result": "\u6574\u4f53\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u738765%\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u8d85\u8fc750%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u9884\u540e\u6a21\u5757\u9884\u6d4bHFpEF\u53d1\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a21.72\u5468\uff0c\u80a5\u80d6\u548c\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u7ec4\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u51c6\u786e", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8fde\u7eedHFpEF\u53d1\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u5408\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u9884\u540e\u5efa\u6a21\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840"}}

We evaluate candidate dataset distance metrics by how well they predict cross-dataset transferability: if two datasets have a small distance, a model trained on one should perform well on the other. We apply the framework on an unsupervised task, channel state information (CSI) compression, using autoencoders. Using metrics based on UMAP embeddings, combined with Wasserstein and Euclidean distances, we achieve Pearson correlations exceeding 0.85 between dataset distances and train-on-one/test-on-another task performance. We also apply the framework to a supervised beam prediction in the downlink using convolutional neural networks. For this task, we derive a label-aware distance by integrating supervised UMAP and penalties for dataset imbalance. Across both tasks, the resulting distances outperform traditional baselines and consistently exhibit stronger correlations with model transferability, supporting task-relevant comparisons between wireless datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728CSI\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9/\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8ddd\u79bb\u9884\u6d4b\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eUMAP\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Wasserstein\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u611f\u77e5\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u76d1\u7763UMAP\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "result": "\u5728CSI\u538b\u7f29\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528UMAP\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u5408Wasserstein\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684Pearson\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u8d85\u8fc70.85\u3002\u5728\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u611f\u77e5\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5ea6\u91cf\u65e0\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, high-quality and large-scale camouflage datasets with dense annotation remain scarce due to expensive data collection and labeling costs. To address this challenge, we explore leveraging generative models to synthesize realistic camouflage image-dense data for training CDP models with fine-grained representations, prior knowledge, and auxiliary reasoning. Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce GenCAMO-DB, a large-scale camouflage dataset with multi-modal annotations, including depth maps, scene graphs, attribute descriptions, and text prompts; (ii) we present GenCAMO, an environment-aware and mask-free generative framework that produces high-fidelity camouflage image-dense annotations; (iii) extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that GenCAMO significantly improves dense prediction performance on complex camouflage scenes by providing high-quality synthetic data. The code and datasets will be released after paper acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGenCAMO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u88c5\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf-\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f2a\u88c5\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982RGB-D\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5272\uff09\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGenCAMO-DB\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f2a\u88c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cGenCAMO\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u65e0\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4f2a\u88c5\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u3001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\uff09", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGenCAMO\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4f2a\u88c5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f2a\u88c5\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0cGenCAMO\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4f2a\u88c5\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301"}}

However, there is still no satisfactory theory that describes how coarse-grained quantities, such as blockwise intensity or class proportions after partitioning an image into spatial blocks, are preserved and evolve along the reverse diffusion dynamics. In previous work, the author introduced an information-theoretic Lyapunov function V for non-ergodic Markov processes on a state space partitioned into blocks, defined as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence to the set of stationary distributions reachable from a given initial condition, and showed that a leak-tolerant potential V-delta with a prescribed tolerance for block masses admits a closed-form expression as a scaling-and-clipping operation on block masses.\n  In this paper, I transplant this framework to the reverse diffusion process in generative models and propose a reverse diffusion scheme that is projected by the potential V-delta (referred to as the V-delta projected reverse diffusion). I extend the monotonicity of V to time-inhomogeneous block-preserving Markov kernels and show that, under small leakage and the V-delta projection, V-delta acts as an approximate Lyapunov function. Furthermore, using a toy model consisting of block-constant images and a simplified reverse kernel, I numerically demonstrate that the proposed method keeps the block-mass error and the leak-tolerant potential within the prescribed tolerance, while achieving pixel-wise accuracy and visual quality comparable to the non-projected dynamics. This study reinterprets generative sampling as a decrease of an information potential from noise to data, and provides a design principle for reverse diffusion processes with explicit control of coarse-grained quantities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbaLyapunov\u51fd\u6570V\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faV-delta\u6295\u5f71\u9006\u5411\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff09\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63cf\u8ff0\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u5757\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff09\u5728\u9006\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5efa\u7acb\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbaLyapunov\u51fd\u6570V\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faV-delta\u6295\u5f71\u9006\u5411\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9006\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6295\u5f71\u5230V-delta\u52bf\u80fd\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u5757\u8d28\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u4e86V\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u9f50\u6b21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6838\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7531\u5757\u5e38\u6570\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u9006\u5411\u6838\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u73a9\u5177\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5c06\u5757\u8d28\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5bb9\u5fcd\u52bf\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u9884\u8bbe\u5bb9\u5dee\u5185\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u975e\u6295\u5f71\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u91c7\u6837\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u52bf\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u88ab\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5361\uff08TTC\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u7136\u5206\u6570\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fc7\u5ea6\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bca\u65ad\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\"\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u53e3\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5361\uff08TTC\uff09\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u6863\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u660e\u786e\u8bb0\u5f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u529b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "TTC\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u7406\u8bba-\u4efb\u52a1\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316-\u8bc4\u5206-\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6709\u6548\u6027\u94fe\u6761\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6216\u8fbe\u6210\u5355\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u5171\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u6765\u907f\u514d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\uff0cTTC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

It extends Video Crowd Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that learns to count pedestrians across frames, VIC must identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however, can underperform in congested scenes such as metro commuting. To address this, we build WuhanMetroCrowd, one of the first VIC datasets that characterize crowded, dynamic pedestrian flows. It features sparse-to-dense density levels, short-to-long video clips, slow-to-fast flow variations, front-to-back appearance changes, and light-to-heavy occlusions. To better adapt VIC approaches to crowds, we rethink the nature of VIC and recognize two informative priors: i) the social grouping prior that indicates pedestrians tend to gather in groups and ii) the spatial-temporal displacement prior that informs an individual cannot teleport physically. The former inspires us to relax the standard one-to-one (O2O) matching used by VIC to one-to-many (O2M) matching, implemented by an implicit context generator and a O2M matcher; the latter facilitates the design of a displacement prior injector, which strengthens not only O2M matching but also feature extraction and model training. These designs jointly form a novel and strong VIC baseline OMAN++. Extensive experiments show that OMAN++ not only outperforms state-of-the-art VIC baselines on the standard SenseCrowd, CroHD, and MovingDroneCrowd benchmarks, but also indicates a clear advantage in crowded scenes, with a 38.12% error reduction on our WuhanMetroCrowd dataset.

While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.\n  We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity.

To tackle this, we propose the Multi-scale Implicit Structural Similarity Measurement (MS-ISSM). Unlike traditional point-to-point matching, MS-ISSM utilizes Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to represent local features continuously, transforming distortion measurement into a comparison of implicit function coefficients. This approach effectively circumvents matching errors inherent in irregular data. Additionally, we propose a ResGrouped-MLP quality assessment network, which robustly maps multi-scale feature differences to perceptual scores. The network architecture departs from traditional flat MLPs by adopting a grouped encoding strategy integrated with Residual Blocks and Channel-wise Attention mechanisms. This hierarchical design allows the model to preserve the distinct physical semantics of luma, chroma, and geometry while adaptively focusing on the most salient distortion features across High, Medium, and Low scales. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MS-ISSM outperforms state-of-the-art metrics in both reliability and generalization.

However, their ability to generate engaging, long-form narratives -- specifically multi-speaker podcast dialogues -- remains under-explored and difficult to evaluate. Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the nuances of conversational naturalness, personality, and narrative flow, often rewarding safe, repetitive outputs over engaging storytelling. In this work, we present a novel pipeline for end-to-end visual podcast generation, and fine-tune a Qwen3-VL-32B model on a curated dataset of 4,000 image-dialogue pairs. Crucially, we use a synthetic-to-real training strategy: we train on high-quality podcast dialogues from the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC) paired with synthetically generated imagery, and evaluate on real-world photo sequences from the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST). This rigorous setup tests the model's ability to generalize from synthetic training data to real-world visual domains. We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that moves beyond textual overlap, and use AI-as-a-judge (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2) and novel style metrics (average turn length, speaker switch rate) to assess quality. Our experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned 32B model significantly outperforms a 235B base model in conversational naturalness ($>$80\\% win rate) and narrative depth (+50\\% turn length), while maintaining identical visual grounding capabilities (CLIPScore: 20.39).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u64ad\u5ba2\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03Qwen3-VL-32B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u6df1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u4eba\u5165\u80dc\u7684\u957f\u7bc7\u53d9\u4e8b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u4eba\u64ad\u5ba2\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5bf9\u8bdd\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u64ad\u5ba2\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b2. \u57284,000\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf-\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03Qwen3-VL-32B\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5728SPoRC\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u64ad\u5ba2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728VIST\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7167\u7247\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u768432B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e235B\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u80dc\u7387>80%\uff09\uff0c\u53d9\u4e8b\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a050%\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u5bf9\u8bdd\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\uff08CLIPScore: 20.39\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u64ad\u5ba2\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u6df1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u7bc7\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike SISR, Reference-based Super-Resolution (RefSR) leverages an additional high-resolution reference image to facilitate the recovery of high-frequency textures. However, existing research mainly focuses on backdoor attacks targeting RefSR, while the vulnerability of the adversarial attacks targeting RefSR has not been fully explored. To fill this research gap, we propose RefSR-Adv, an adversarial attack that degrades SR outputs by perturbing only the reference image. By maximizing the difference between adversarial and clean outputs, RefSR-Adv induces significant performance degradation and generates severe artifacts across CNN, Transformer, and Mamba architectures on the CUFED5, WR-SR, and DRefSR datasets. Importantly, experiments confirm a positive correlation between the similarity of the low-resolution input and the reference image and attack effectiveness, revealing that the model's over-reliance on reference features is a key security flaw. This study reveals a security vulnerability in RefSR systems, aiming to urge researchers to pay attention to the robustness of RefSR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRefSR-Adv\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u6270\u52a8\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RefSR\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u8003\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9488\u5bf9RefSR\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63ed\u793aRefSR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRefSR-Adv\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6dfb\u52a0\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "RefSR-Adv\u5728CNN\u3001Transformer\u548cMamba\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "RefSR\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u8003\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RefSR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5173\u6ce8RefSR\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Traditional monitoring methods often rely on manual labor and are time consuming, leading to potential delays in addressing issues. This paper proposes the integration of low-power edge devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) into aquaculture systems to enable real-time automated monitoring and control, such as collecting data and triggering alarms, and reducing labor requirements. The system provides real-time data on the required parameters such as pH levels, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia levels to control water quality, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions enabling better maintenance, efficient resource utilization, and optimal management of the enclosed aquaculture space. The system enables alerts in case of anomaly detection. The data collected by the sensors over time can serve for important decision-making regarding optimizing water treatment processes, feed distribution, feed pattern analysis and improve feed efficiency, reducing operational costs. This research explores the feasibility of developing TinyML-based solutions for aquaculture monitoring, considering factors such as sensor selection, algorithm design, hardware constraints, and ethical considerations.

Specifically, redundant KVs originating from multi-view inputs are pruned through efficient token importance identification, enabling a fixed memory budget. Leveraging the unique distribution of KV tensors, we incorporate KV quantization to further reduce memory consumption.

There are three principled ways to deal with non-stationarity, including sliding-window, weighted, and restart strategies. As many non-stationary environments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is commonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical studies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either computationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits the weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits (LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret analysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design. We propose a \\emph{refined analysis framework}, which simplifies the derivation and, importantly, produces a simpler weight-based algorithm that is as efficient as window/restart-based algorithms while retaining the same regret as previous studies. Furthermore, our new framework can be used to improve regret bounds of other parametric bandits, including Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) and Self-Concordant Bandits (SCB). For example, we develop a simple weighted GLB algorithm with an $\\tilde{O}(k_\u03bc^{5/4} c_\u03bc^{-3/4} d^{3/4} P_T^{1/4}T^{3/4})$ regret, improving the $\\tilde{O}(k_\u03bc^{2} c_\u03bc^{-1}d^{9/10} P_T^{1/5}T^{4/5})$ bound in prior work, where $k_\u03bc$ and $c_\u03bc$ characterize the reward model's nonlinearity, $P_T$ measures the non-stationarity, $d$ and $T$ denote the dimension and time horizon. Moreover, we extend our framework to non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with function approximation, focusing on Linear Mixture MDP and Multinomial Logit (MNL) Mixture MDP. For both classes, we propose algorithms based on the weighted strategy and establish dynamic regret guarantees using our analysis framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u53c2\u6570\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4e2d\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u3001\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u3001\u81ea\u534f\u8c03\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5177\u6709\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u7684MDPs\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u53c2\u6570\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6e10\u8fdb\u6f02\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u65f6\u5e38\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u7b97\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u8981\u4e48\u7edf\u8ba1\u6b21\u4f18\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u3001\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u3001\u81ea\u534f\u8c03\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5177\u6709\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e0e\u7a97\u53e3/\u91cd\u542f\u7b97\u6cd5\u540c\u6837\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4e2d\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c $\\tilde{O}(k_\u03bc^{5/4} c_\u03bc^{-3/4} d^{3/4} P_T^{1/4}T^{3/4})$\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684 $\\tilde{O}(k_\u03bc^{2} c_\u03bc^{-1}d^{9/10} P_T^{1/5}T^{4/5})$\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408MDP\u548c\u591a\u9879Logit\u6df7\u5408MDP\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7cbe\u70bc\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u53c2\u6570\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4e2d\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u548c\u5177\u6709\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u7684MDPs\u4e2d\u3002"}}

These streams obey smooth, time-parameterized symmetries, which combine through a precisely structured algebra; yet most neural network world models ignore this structure and instead repeatedly re-learn the same transformations from data. In this work, we introduce 'Flow Equivariant World Models', a framework in which both self-motion and external object motion are unified as one-parameter Lie group 'flows'. We leverage this unification to implement group equivariance with respect to these transformations, thereby providing a stable latent world representation over hundreds of timesteps. On both 2D and 3D partially observed video world modeling benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flow Equivariant World Models significantly outperform comparable state-of-the-art diffusion-based and memory-augmented world modeling architectures -- particularly when there are predictable world dynamics outside the agent's current field of view. We show that flow equivariance is particularly beneficial for long rollouts, generalizing far beyond the training horizon. By structuring world model representations with respect to internal and external motion, flow equivariance charts a scalable route to data efficient, symmetry-guided, embodied intelligence.

To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 can be effectively used for this task, but training an effective detection model requires gathering a large dataset with high-quality annotations from domain experts, which is prohibitively time-consuming. In this work, we aim to facilitate and accelerate the annotation of SAR images for avalanche mapping. We build on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a segmentation foundation model trained on natural images, and tailor it to Sentinel-1 SAR data. Adapting SAM to our use-case requires addressing several domain-specific challenges: (i) domain mismatch, since SAM was not trained on satellite/SAR imagery; (ii) input adaptation, because SAR products typically provide more than three channels, while SAM is constrained to RGB images; (iii) robustness to imprecise prompts that can affect target identification and degrade the segmentation quality, an issue exacerbated in small, low-contrast avalanches; and (iv) training efficiency, since standard fine-tuning is computationally demanding for SAM. We tackle these challenges through a combination of adapters to mitigate the domain gap, multiple encoders to handle multi-channel SAR inputs, prompt-engineering strategies to improve avalanche localization accuracy, and a training algorithm that limits the training time of the encoder, which is recognized as the major bottleneck. We integrate the resulting model into an annotation tool and show experimentally that it speeds up the annotation of SAR images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528Segment Anything Model (SAM)\u9002\u914dSentinel-1 SAR\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3001\u591a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u4e8e\u96ea\u5d29\u5206\u5272\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "SAR\u5f71\u50cf\u7528\u4e8e\u96ea\u5d29\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8017\u65f6\u8fc7\u957f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u52a0\u901fSentinel-1 SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u96ea\u5d29\u6807\u6ce8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSAM\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9SAR\u6570\u636e\u7279\u70b9\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7f13\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2) \u591a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u591a\u901a\u9053SAR\u8f93\u5165\uff1b3) \u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u96ea\u5d29\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b4) \u9650\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fSAR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u96ea\u5d29\u6807\u6ce8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u7684SAM\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3SAR\u96ea\u5d29\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u96ea\u5d29\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u51cf\u707e\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Fontaine", "Stefanos Nikolaidis"], "title": "Discount Model Search for Quality Diversity Optimization in High-Dimensional Measure Spaces", "comment": "Source code available at https://github.com/icaros-usc/discount-models", "summary": "Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms focus on low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and thus receive identical discount values. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new QD applications by introducing two domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other black-box QD algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "DMS\uff08Discount Model Search\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u6298\u6263\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709QD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u4f1a\u88ab\u5f52\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00\u7c7b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a2\u7d22\u505c\u6ede\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662fCMA-MAE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u7684\u6298\u6263\u503c\u5206\u914d\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiscount Model Search\uff08DMS\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u6298\u6263\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "DMS\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eCMA-MAE\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u9ed1\u76d2QD\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6307\u5b9a\u671f\u671b\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5ea6\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "DMS\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6298\u6263\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86QD\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of large-scale, annotated real-world data, forcing a reliance on synthetic datasets. This reliance introduces a significant sim-to-real domain gap, leading to poor generalization, low-fidelity human geometry, and poor alignment on in-the-wild videos. To address this, we propose an innovative training paradigm that effectively leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data. Our framework bridges strong, disparate priors from scene reconstruction and HMR, and is trained with two core components: (1) a robust distillation strategy to refine human surface details by distilling high-frequency details from an expert depth model, and (2) a two-stage supervision scheme, which first learns coarse localization on synthetic data, then fine-tunes on real data by directly optimizing the geometric correspondence between the SMPL mesh and the human point cloud. This approach enables our feed-forward model to jointly recover high-fidelity scene geometry, human point clouds, camera parameters, and coherent, metric-scale SMPL bodies, all in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on human-centric scene reconstruction and delivers highly competitive results on global human motion estimation, comparing favorably against both optimization-based frameworks and HMR-only methods.

While domain-specific foundation models have achieved success for each modality individually, they remain isolated, limiting our ability to model integrated cellular processes. Here we present the Central Dogma Transformer (CDT), an architecture that integrates pre-trained language models for DNA, RNA, and protein following the directional logic of the Central Dogma. CDT employs directional cross-attention mechanisms - DNA-to-RNA attention models transcriptional regulation, while RNA-to-Protein attention models translational relationships - producing a unified Virtual Cell Embedding that integrates all three modalities. We validate CDT v1 - a proof-of-concept implementation using fixed (non-cell-specific) RNA and protein embeddings - on CRISPRi enhancer perturbation data from K562 cells, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.503, representing 63% of the theoretical ceiling set by cross-experiment variability (r = 0.797). Attention and gradient analyses provide complementary interpretive windows: in detailed case studies, these approaches highlight largely distinct genomic regions, with gradient analysis identifying a CTCF binding site that Hi-C data showed as physically contacting both enhancer and target gene.

Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., \"symbolic reasoning\". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can \"reason\" by way of imitating the process of \"thinking out loud\", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the \"stochastic parrot\" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\"\u5927\u58f0\u601d\u8003\"\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u67d0\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6839\u57fa\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u8fd9\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u7684\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u8ba4\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\"\u5927\u58f0\u601d\u8003\"\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8def\u5f84\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u54f2\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u54f2\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\"\u968f\u673a\u9e66\u9e49\"\u6bd4\u55bb\u5df2\u5931\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53cd\u601d\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u8003\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u8981\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\"\u5927\u58f0\u601d\u8003\"\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8def\u5f84\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u67d0\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6839\u57fa\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u8fd9\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8868\u660e\"\u968f\u673a\u9e66\u9e49\"\u6bd4\u55bb\u5df2\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5c55\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

The resulting training objective serves as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information (MI) between slots and inputs, strengthening slot representation quality. On both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO), CODA improves object discovery (e.g., +6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation over strong baselines.

However, existing screening tools - primarily developed using populations from high-income countries - often underperform in Bangladesh and South Asia, where risk profiles differ. Most of these tools rely on simple additive scoring functions and are based on data from patients with advanced-stage CKD. Consequently, they fail to capture complex interactions among risk factors and are limited in predicting early-stage CKD. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning (ML) framework for community-based early-stage CKD screening for low-resource settings, tailored to the Bangladeshi and South Asian population context. We used a community-based dataset from Bangladesh, the first such CKD dataset in South and South Asia, and evaluated twelve ML classifiers across multiple feature domains. Ten complementary feature selection techniques were applied to identify robust, generalizable predictors. The final models were assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. External validation was conducted on three independent datasets from India, the UAE, and Bangladesh. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to provide model explainability. An ML model trained on an RFECV-selected feature subset achieved a balanced accuracy of 90.40%, whereas minimal non-pathology-test features demonstrated excellent predictive capability with a balanced accuracy of 89.23%, often outperforming larger or full feature sets.

Our comprehensive evaluation across four continuous control environments demonstrates that third-order derivative penalties (jerk minimization) consistently achieve superior smoothness while maintaining competitive performance.

A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction. Empirical results on multiple graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that HISTOGRAPH offers strong performance that consistently improves traditional techniques, with particularly strong robustness in deep GNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "HISTOGRAPH\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u805a\u5408\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6GNN\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u5176\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42GNN\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c60\u5316\u6216\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff08\u5386\u53f2\u56fe\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u5c42\u6570\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c24\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u56fe\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHISTOGRAPH\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7840\u6700\u7ec8\u805a\u5408\u5c42\uff1a1\uff09\u9996\u5148\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u5728\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u7cbe\u70bc\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHISTOGRAPH\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6GNN\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HISTOGRAPH\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u56fe\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u836f\u72693D\u6253\u5370\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u56db\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u63a8\u8350\u8f85\u6599\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e1d\u6750\u673a\u68b0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Llama2\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u836f\u72693D\u6253\u5370\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u72ed\u7a84\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u5728\u836f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5229\u7528\u5176\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u63a8\u8350\u8f85\u6599\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u4e86\u56db\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b1400\u591a\u79cd\u5236\u5242\u914d\u65b9\u7684\u7194\u878d\u6c89\u79ef\u5efa\u6a21\uff08FDM\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u6d3b\u6027\u836f\u7269\u6210\u5206\uff08API\uff09\u5242\u91cf\u63a8\u8350\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8f85\u6599\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e1d\u6750\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aLlama2\u5728\u63a8\u8350FDM\u5236\u5242\u8f85\u6599\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684LLM\u51fa\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5373\u4f7f1400\u591a\u4e2a\u914d\u65b9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b2\uff09\u6807\u51c6LLM\u6307\u6807\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u800c\u975e\u5236\u5242\u53ef\u52a0\u5de5\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLM\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u836f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u836f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce RFAssigner, a novel assignment strategy designed to enhance the multi-scale learning capabilities of dense detectors. RFAssigner first establishes an initial set of positive samples using a point-based prior. It then leverages a Gaussian Receptive Field (GRF) distance to measure the similarity between the GRFs of unassigned candidate locations and the ground-truth objects. Based on this metric, RFAssigner adaptively selects supplementary positive samples from the unassigned pool, promoting a more balanced learning process across object scales. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets with distinct object scale distributions validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.

According to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (1953), family resemblance holds that members of a concept or category are connected by overlapping similarities rather than a single defining property. Consequently, a family of entities forms a chain of items sharing overlapping traits. This philosophical idea naturally lends itself to a graph-based approach in machine learning. Accordingly, we propose the Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance (WFR) clustering algorithm and its kernel variant, kernel WFR.

Existing memory systems often store isolated records and retrieve fragments, limiting their ability to consolidate evolving user states and resolve conflicts. We introduce EverMemOS, a self-organizing memory operating system that implements an engram-inspired lifecycle for computational memory. Episodic Trace Formation converts dialogue streams into MemCells that capture episodic traces, atomic facts, and time-bounded Foresight signals. Semantic Consolidation organizes MemCells into thematic MemScenes, distilling stable semantic structures and updating user profiles. Reconstructive Recollection performs MemScene-guided agentic retrieval to compose the necessary and sufficient context for downstream reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval show that EverMemOS achieves state-of-the-art performance on memory-augmented reasoning tasks.

To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences. The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset. Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a novel utility-guided multi-objective loss jointly optimizes decisions, router parameters, routing behavior, expert utilization, and computational cost by adaptively regulating token-level expert activation. Finally, the proposed MambaFormer is cross-validated (holdout) for medical QA on the new, custom-designed DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets and compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

Conventional supervised learning methods frequently underperform in scenarios characterised by little labelled data or imbalanced datasets. This study introduces a hybrid semi-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that integrates Neurochaos Learning (NL) with a threshold-based Self-Training (ST) method to overcome this constraint. The NL architecture converts input characteristics into chaos-based ring-rate representations that encapsulate nonlinear relationships within the data, whereas ST progressively enlarges the labelled set utilising high-confidence pseudo-labelled samples. The model's performance is assessed using ten benchmark datasets and five machine learning classifiers, with 85% of the training data considered unlabelled and just 15% utilised as labelled data. The proposed Self-Training Neurochaos Learning (NL+ST) architecture consistently attains superior performance gain relative to standalone ST models, especially on limited, nonlinear and imbalanced datasets like Iris (188.66%), Wine (158.58%) and Glass Identification (110.48%).

Although many deep learning methods have proven effective in learning time-series data for classification, they were originally developed under the assumption of balanced data distributions. Once data distribution is uneven, these methods tend to ignore the minority class that is typically of higher practical significance. Oversampling methods have been designed to address this by generating minority-class samples, but their reliance on linear interpolation often hampers the preservation of temporal dynamics and the generation of diverse samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Evo-TFS, a novel evolutionary oversampling method that integrates both time- and frequency-domain characteristics. In Evo-TFS, strongly typed genetic programming is employed to evolve diverse, high-quality time series, guided by a fitness function that incorporates both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics. Experiments conducted on imbalanced time series datasets demonstrate that Evo-TFS outperforms existing oversampling methods, significantly enhancing the performance of time-domain and frequency-domain classifiers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Evo-TFS\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6837\u672c", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u7c7b\u578b\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\u8fdb\u5316\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u6307\u5bfc\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEvo-TFS\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u9891\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "Evo-TFS\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u6837\u672c"}}

A core challenge in categorical data clustering lies in measuring similarity among attribute values that lack inherent ordering or distance. Without appropriate similarity measures, values are often treated as equidistant, creating a semantic gap that obscures latent structures and degrades clustering quality. Although existing methods infer value relationships from within-dataset co-occurrence patterns, such inference becomes unreliable when samples are limited, leaving the semantic context of the data underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present ARISE (Attention-weighted Representation with Integrated Semantic Embeddings), which draws on external semantic knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic-aware representations that complement the metric space of categorical data for accurate clustering. That is, LLM is adopted to describe attribute values for representation enhancement, and the LLM-enhanced embeddings are combined with the original data to explore semantically prominent clusters. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over seven representative counterparts, with gains of 19-27%.

Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\\times$ to $7\\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost. As a result, Falcon-H1R demonstrates that compact models, through targeted model training and architectural choices, can deliver robust and scalable reasoning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Falcon-H1R\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a7B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e2-7\u500d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528DeepConf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFalcon-H1R-7B\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6bd4\u5176\u59272-7\u500d\u7684SOTA\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u901f\u5ea6\u3001token\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff09\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

To study this regime, we introduce VReID-XFD, a video-based benchmark and community challenge for extreme far-distance (XFD) aerial-to-ground person re-identification. VReID-XFD is derived from the DetReIDX dataset and comprises 371 identities, 11,288 tracklets, and 11.75 million frames, captured across altitudes from 5.8 m to 120 m, viewing angles from oblique (30 degrees) to nadir (90 degrees), and horizontal distances up to 120 m. The benchmark supports aerial-to-aerial, aerial-to-ground, and ground-to-aerial evaluation under strict identity-disjoint splits, with rich physical metadata. The VReID-XFD-25 Challenge attracted 10 teams with hundreds of submissions. Systematic analysis reveals monotonic performance degradation with altitude and distance, a universal disadvantage of nadir views, and a trade-off between peak performance and robustness. Even the best-performing SAS-PReID method achieves only 43.93 percent mAP in the aerial-to-ground setting.

Game-based assessment offers a promising alternative by capturing implicit behavioral signals during gameplay. This study proposes a multi-genre serious-game framework combined with machine-learning techniques to predict suitability for software development roles. Developer-relevant personality and behavioral traits were identified through a systematic literature review and an empirical study of professional software engineers. A custom mobile game was designed to elicit behaviors related to problem solving, planning, adaptability, persistence, time management, and information seeking. Fine-grained gameplay event data were collected and analyzed using a two-phase modeling strategy where suitability was predicted exclusively from gameplay-derived behavioral features. Results show that our model achieved up to 97% precision and 94% accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that proper candidates exhibited distinct gameplay patterns, such as more wins in puzzle-based games, more side challenges, navigating menus more frequently, and exhibiting fewer pauses, retries, and surrender actions. These findings demonstrate that implicit behavioral traces captured during gameplay is promising in predicting software-development suitability without explicit personality testing, supporting serious games as a scalable, engaging, and less biased alternative for career assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u4e25\u8083\u6e38\u620f\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5c97\u4f4d\u9002\u5408\u5ea6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe94%\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u683c\u6d4b\u8bd5", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u804c\u4e1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u5377\u5b58\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u75b2\u52b3\u548c\u6545\u610f\u626d\u66f2\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u56de\u987e\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u5b9a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u76f8\u5173\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9a\u5236\u79fb\u52a8\u6e38\u620f\u6355\u6349\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u4ece\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u9002\u5408\u5ea6", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523097%\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c94%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5408\u9002\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u89e3\u8c1c\u6e38\u620f\u80dc\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u5b8c\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u652f\u7ebf\u6311\u6218\u3001\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u5bfc\u822a\u83dc\u5355\u3001\u8f83\u5c11\u6682\u505c/\u91cd\u8bd5/\u653e\u5f03", "conclusion": "\u6e38\u620f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6355\u6349\u7684\u9690\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u75d5\u8ff9\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u5408\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e25\u8083\u6e38\u620f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u804c\u4e1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u4e14\u504f\u89c1\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848"}}

To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block. The proposed framework demonstrates that state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning can be achieved without quadratic attention, thus opening up avenues for long-context VLMs that can deal with high-resolution images and long videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "LinMU\u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7M-MATE\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b+\u5c40\u90e8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e14\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faLinMU\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528M-MATE\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6a21\u5757\uff08Flex-MA\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b + Local-Swin\u5c40\u90e8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u6240\u6709\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3Flex-MA\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u518d\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3Local-Swin\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5269\u4f59\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u56de\u5f52\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u548ctoken\u7ea7logits\u3002", "result": "\u5728MMMU\u3001TextVQA\u3001LongVideoBench\u3001Video-MME\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLinMU\u5339\u914d\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u9996token\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e2.7\u500d\uff0c\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u89c6\u9891\u7684token\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53479.0\u500d\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u9700\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We propose a sparse signed message passing network that is naturally robust to edge noise and heterophily, which can be interpreted from a Bayesian perspective. By combining (i) posterior marginalization over signed graph structures with (ii) sparse signed message aggregation, our approach offers a principled way to handle both edge noise and heterophily.

Existing methods, mainly based on reducing neural decoding to generation tasks or simple correlations, fail to reflect the hierarchical and temporal processes of visual processing in the brain. To address these limitations, we present NeuroAlign, a novel framework for fine-grained fMRI-video alignment inspired by the hierarchical organization of the human visual system. Our framework implements a two-stage mechanism that mirrors biological visual pathways: global semantic understanding through Neural-Temporal Contrastive Learning (NTCL) and fine-grained pattern matching through enhanced vector quantization. NTCL explicitly models temporal dynamics through bidirectional prediction between modalities, while our DynaSyncMM-EMA approach enables dynamic multi-modal fusion with adaptive weighting. Experiments demonstrate that NeuroAlign significantly outperforms existing methods in cross-modal retrieval tasks, establishing a new paradigm for understanding visual cognitive mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroAlign\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8efMRI-\u89c6\u9891\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u5927\u8111\u89c6\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u8111\u8868\u793a\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "NeuroAlign\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf-\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60(NTCL)\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528DynaSyncMM-EMA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNeuroAlign\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroAlign\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u7269\u89c6\u89c9\u901a\u8def\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86fMRI-\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Evaluated on 61,538 admissions across 3,793 U.S. hospitals and 4 regions, our method achieves target coverage (94.3% vs 95% target) with adaptive precision: 21% narrower intervals for low-uncertainty cases while appropriately widening for high-risk predictions. Critically, we demonstrate that well-calibrated Bayesian uncertainties alone severely under-cover (14.1%), highlighting the necessity of our hybrid approach.

Conditioning on a single image completely ignores the temporal signature, which leads to pose-locked motions, unnatural warping, and \"average\" faces when viewpoints and expressions change. To this end, we introduce an identity-conditioned variant of a diffusion-transformer video generator which uses a short reference video rather than a single portrait. Our key idea is to incorporate the dynamics in the reference. A short clip reveals subject-specific patterns, e.g., how smiles form, across poses and lighting. From this clip, a Sinkhorn-routed encoder learns compact identity tokens that capture characteristic dynamics while remaining pretrained backbone-compatible. Despite adding only lightweight conditioning, the approach consistently improves identity retention under large pose changes and expressive facial behavior, while maintaining prompt faithfulness and visual realism across diverse subjects and prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77ed\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u4e3b\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u6539\u5584\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u59ff\u52bf\u9501\u5b9a\u3001\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u626d\u66f2\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u9762\u90e8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8fd0\u52a8", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u77ed\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u800c\u975e\u5355\u5f20\u8096\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Sinkhorn\u8def\u7531\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4e3b\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u77ed\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u6355\u6349\u4e3b\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Traditional digital divide frameworks fail to explain these variations.\n  Purpose: This study introduces the \"Dependency Divide\", a novel framework proposing that highly engaged students become conditionally vulnerable to infrastructure failures, challenging assumptions that engagement uniformly benefits learners in post-access environments.\n  Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 396 university students in Bangladesh using a three-stage analytical approach: (1) stability-validated K-prototypes clustering to identify student profiles, (2) profile-specific Random Forest models with SHAP and ALE analysis to determine satisfaction drivers, and (3) formal interaction analysis with propensity score matching to test the Dependency Divide hypothesis.\n  Results: Three distinct profiles emerged: Casually Engaged (58%), Efficient Learners (35%), and Hyper-Engaged (7%). A significant interaction between educational device time and internet reliability (\\b{eta} = 0.033, p = 0.028) confirmed the Dependency Divide: engagement increased satisfaction only when infrastructure remained reliable. Hyper-Engaged students showed greatest vulnerability despite or because of their sophisticated digital workflows. Policy simulations demonstrated that targeted reliability improvements for high-dependency users yielded 2.06 times greater returns than uniform interventions.\n  Conclusions: In fragile infrastructure contexts, capability can become liability. Digital transformation policies must prioritize reliability for dependency-prone users, establish contingency systems, and educate students about dependency risks rather than uniformly promoting engagement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\"\u4f9d\u8d56\u9e3f\u6c9f\"\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6295\u5165\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u53cd\u800c\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u800c\u66f4\u6613\u53d7\u7f51\u7edc\u6545\u969c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\"\u6295\u5165\u8d8a\u591a\u8d8a\u597d\"\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u5b57\u9e3f\u6c9f\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u53f0\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u63a5\u5165\u666e\u53ca\u540e\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd396\u540d\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) K-prototypes\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u5b66\u751f\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b3) \u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9e3f\u6c9f\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e09\u7c7b\u5b66\u751f\uff1a\u968f\u610f\u53c2\u4e0e\u578b(58%)\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u8005(35%)\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6295\u5165\u578b(7%)\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6559\u80b2\u8bbe\u5907\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4f9d\u8d56\u9e3f\u6c9f\u5b58\u5728\u2014\u2014\u6295\u5165\u5ea6\u4ec5\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u53ef\u9760\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3002\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6295\u5165\u578b\u5b66\u751f\u6700\u6613\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u5e72\u9884\u76842.06\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u6570\u5b57\u8f6c\u578b\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u969c\u9ad8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5e94\u6025\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u751f\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u5473\u63a8\u5e7f\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, ReID faces significant challenges such as appearance variations, domain shifts, and limited labeled data. This dissertation proposes three advanced approaches to enhance ReID performance under supervised, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and fully unsupervised settings. First, SCM-ReID integrates supervised contrastive learning with hybrid loss optimization (classification, center, triplet, and centroid-triplet losses), improving discriminative feature representation and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on Market-1501 and CUHK03 datasets. Second, for UDA, IQAGA and DAPRH combine GAN-based image augmentation, domain-invariant mapping, and pseudo-label refinement to mitigate domain discrepancies and enhance cross-domain generalization. Experiments demonstrate substantial gains over baseline methods, with mAP and Rank-1 improvements up to 12% in challenging transfer scenarios. Finally, ViTC-UReID leverages Vision Transformer-based feature encoding and camera-aware proxy learning to boost unsupervised ReID. By integrating global and local attention with camera identity constraints, this method significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches on large-scale benchmarks. Comprehensive evaluations across CUHK03, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The contributions advance ReID research by addressing key limitations in feature learning, domain adaptation, and label noise handling, paving the way for robust deployment in real-world surveillance systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aSCM-ReID\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u3001IQAGA/DAPRH\uff08\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff09\u548cViTC-UReID\uff08\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1.

Embedding IMUs into loose-fitting garments is a desirable alternative, yet sensor-body displacement introduces severe, structured, and location-dependent corruption that breaks standard inertial pipelines. We propose GID (Garment Inertial Denoiser), a lightweight, plug-and-play Transformer that factorizes loose-wear MoCap into three stages: (i) location-specific denoising, (ii) adaptive cross-wear fusion, and (iii) general pose prediction. GID uses a location-aware expert architecture, where a shared spatio-temporal backbone models global motion while per-IMU expert heads specialize in local garment dynamics, and a lightweight fusion module ensures cross-part consistency.

Given modern seismic acquisition systems, the data (as input for FWI) required for an industrial-strength case is in the teraflop level of storage, therefore solving complex subsurface cases or exploring multiple scenarios with FWI become prohibitive. The proposed method utilizes a deep neural network with a binarized sensing layer that learns by compressed learning a succinct but consequential seismic acquisition layout from a large corpus of subsurface models. Thus, given a large seismic data set to invert, the trained network selects a smaller subset of the data, then by using representation learning, an autoencoder computes latent representations of the data, followed by K-means clustering of the latent representations to further select the most relevant data for FWI. Effectively, this approach can be seen as a hierarchical selection. The proposed approach consistently outperforms random data sampling, even when utilizing only 10% of the data for 2D FWI, these results pave the way to accelerating FWI in large scale 3D inversion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u5b66\u4e60\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u6ce2\u5f62\u53cd\u6f14\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u952e\u5730\u9707\u91c7\u96c6\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cK-means\u805a\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5730\u9707\u91c7\u96c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230TB\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5168\u6ce2\u5f62\u53cd\u6f14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u590d\u6742\u5730\u4e0b\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u6216\u591a\u573a\u666f\u63a2\u7d22\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u5730\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u952e\u5730\u9707\u91c7\u96c6\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u9009\u62e9\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u7528K-means\u805a\u7c7b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684FWI\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752810%\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c2D FWI\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u53cd\u6f14\u52a0\u901fFWI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eFWI\u8f93\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8FWI\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u3002"}}

Existing expectation-maximization based solution to this problem often misses rare but important morphologies and requires extensive manual hyperparameter tuning. Addressing this issue, we present a disentangled deep representation learning framework that separates SE(3) transformations from morphological content in the representation space. The framework includes a novel multi-choice learning module that enables this disentanglement for highly noisy cryo-ET data, and the learned morphological content is used to generate template morphologies.

However, despite the empirical evidence of its usefulness, we still do not truly understand how ICL works. In this paper, we compare the behavior of in-context learning with supervised classifiers trained on ICL demonstrations to investigate three research questions: (1) Do LLMs with ICL behave similarly to classifiers trained on the same examples? (2) If so, which classifiers are closer, those based on gradient descent (GD) or those based on k-nearest neighbors (kNN)? (3) When they do not behave similarly, what conditions are associated with differences in behavior? Using text classification as a use case, with six datasets and three LLMs, we observe that LLMs behave similarly to these classifiers when the relevance of demonstrations is high. On average, ICL is closer to kNN than logistic regression, giving empirical evidence that the attention mechanism behaves more similarly to kNN than GD. However, when demonstration relevance is low, LLMs perform better than these classifiers, likely because LLMs can back off to their parametric memory, a luxury these classifiers do not have.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60(ICL)\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u793a\u4f8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u6f14\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0cICL\u8868\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3ckNN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60(ICL)\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u5b9a\u5236LLM\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76ICL\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u8fdb\u5bf9ICL\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83ICL\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u793a\u4f8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548ck\u8fd1\u90bb\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u6f14\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e14ICL\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1kNN\u800c\u975e\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\uff1b\u5f53\u6f14\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aLLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5176\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "conclusion": "ICL\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6f14\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u65f6\u7c7b\u4f3ckNN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u6f14\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\u65f6LLM\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3ICL\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

However, existing works focus on 2D parking slot perception, mapping, and localization, 3D reconstruction remains underexplored, which is crucial for capturing complex spatial geometry in parking scenarios. Naively improving the visual quality of reconstructed parking scenes does not directly benefit autonomous parking, as the key entry point for parking is the slots perception module. To address these limitations, we curate the first benchmark named ParkRecon3D, specifically designed for parking scene reconstruction. It includes sensor data from four surround-view fisheye cameras with calibrated extrinsics and dense parking slot annotations. We then propose ParkGaussian, the first framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for parking scene reconstruction. To further improve the alignment between reconstruction and downstream parking slot detection, we introduce a slot-aware reconstruction strategy that leverages existing parking perception methods to enhance the synthesis quality of slot regions. Experiments on ParkRecon3D demonstrate that ParkGaussian achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and better preserves perception consistency for downstream tasks.

Barron space theory addresses this: if a target function belongs to a Barron space, a two-layer network with $n$ parameters achieves an $O(n^{-1/2})$ approximation error in $L^2$. Yet classical Barron spaces $\\mathscr{B}^{s+1}$ still require stronger regularity than Sobolev spaces $H^s$, and existing depth-sensitive results often assume constraints such as $sL \\le 1/2$. In this paper, we introduce a log-weighted Barron space $\\mathscr{B}^{\\log}$, which requires a strictly weaker assumption than $\\mathscr{B}^s$ for any $s>0$. For this new function space, we first study embedding properties and carry out a statistical analysis via the Rademacher complexity. Then we prove that functions in $\\mathscr{B}^{\\log}$ can be approximated by deep ReLU networks with explicit depth dependence. We then define a family $\\mathscr{B}^{s,\\log}$, establish approximation bounds in the $H^1$ norm, and identify maximal depth scales under which these rates are preserved.

First, it is proved that Voronoi tessellations over canonical orthonormal frames yield drift metrics that are invariant to orthogonal transformations. The rotations and reflections that preserve Euclidean geometry. Second, it is established that this framework achieves O(N) complexity per snapshot while providing cell-level spatial localization of distributional change. Third, a graph-theoretic characterization of drift propagation is developed that distinguishes coherent distributional shifts from isolated perturbations. Fourth, product quantization tessellation is introduced for scaling to very high dimensions (d>500) by decomposing the space into independent subspaces and aggregating drift signals across subspaces.\n  This paper formalizes the theoretical foundations, proves invariance properties, and presents experimental validation demonstrating that the framework correctly identifies drift under coordinate rotation while existing methods produce false positives.

This work introduces SwinIFS, a landmark-guided super-resolution framework that integrates structural priors with hierarchical attention mechanisms to achieve identity-preserving reconstruction at both moderate and extreme upscaling factors. The method incorporates dense Gaussian heatmaps of key facial landmarks into the input representation, enabling the network to focus on semantically important facial regions from the earliest stages of processing. A compact Swin Transformer backbone is employed to capture long-range contextual information while preserving local geometry, allowing the model to restore subtle facial textures and maintain global structural consistency. Extensive experiments on the CelebA benchmark demonstrate that SwinIFS achieves superior perceptual quality, sharper reconstructions, and improved identity retention; it consistently produces more photorealistic results and exhibits strong performance even under 8x magnification, where most methods fail to recover meaningful structure. SwinIFS also provides an advantageous balance between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications in facial enhancement, surveillance, and digital restoration.

We present Warp Cortex, an asynchronous architecture that theoretically enables million-agent cognitive scaling by decoupling agent logic from physical memory. Through Singleton Weight Sharing and a novel Topological Synapse--inspired by hybrid landmarking techniques from Topological Data Analysis (TDA)--we reduce memory complexity from O(N * L) to O(1) for weights and O(N * k) for context, where k << L. By treating the KV-cache as a point cloud in latent space, we apply witness-complex-inspired sparsification to preserve persistent homological features of the context manifold. On a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, we empirically demonstrate 100 concurrent agents at 2.2 GB total VRAM, with theoretical capacity exceeding 1,000 agents before compute latency becomes the bottleneck.

Conventional multi-task attribute recognition methods often process the entire feature map for feature extraction and attribute classification, which can produce redundant features due to reliance on global regions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach emphasizing the selection of specific feature regions for efficient feature learning. We introduce the Mask-Guided Multi-Task Network (MGMTN), which integrates Adaptive Mask Learning (AML) and Group-Global Feature Fusion (G2FF) to address the aforementioned limitations. Leveraging a pre-trained keypoint annotation model and a fully convolutional network, AML accurately localizes critical facial parts (e.g., eye and mouth groups) and generates group masks that delineate meaningful feature regions, thereby mitigating negative transfer from global region usage. Furthermore, G2FF combines group and global features to enhance FAR learning, enabling more precise attribute identification. Extensive experiments on two challenging facial attribute recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MGMTN in improving FAR performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMGMTN\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u7ec4-\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5b9a\u9762\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u8138\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5904\u7406\u6574\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u533a\u57df\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7f51\u7edc(MGMTN)\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u5b66\u4e60(AML)\u548c\u5206\u7ec4-\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408(G2FF)\u3002AML\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u6807\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5168\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u9762\u90e8\u90e8\u4f4d\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5206\u7ec4\u63a9\u7801\uff1bG2FF\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eMGMTN\u5728\u63d0\u5347FAR\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MGMTN\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u533a\u57df\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A central requirement of $\u03bc$P is the satisfaction of certain spectral conditions on weight matrices, which ensure consistent feature learning and optimization behavior as model width grows. While these conditions are well understood in theory, guaranteeing their validity in practical training for matrix-based optimizers such as Muon is still under studied. Existing works that study Muon under $\u03bc$P exhibit important limitations: they either do not ensure that the spectral conditions hold throughout the entire training horizon, or require repeated spectral normalization (or Newton-Schulz iterations) applied to both weights and updates, leading to significant computational overhead and reduced practicality. In this work, we show how to reliably guarantee the spectral conditions required by $\u03bc$P for Muon during the entire training process. Our key insight is that for moderately large models, maintaining spectral control at the level of optimizer updates alone is sufficient to preserve $\u03bc$P-compatible scaling, eliminating the need for explicit spectral normalization of the weights. Based on this principle, we develop a variant of Muon, namely Muon++, that satisfies spectral condition throughout the training process. Our results bridge the gap between the theoretical promises of $\u03bc$P and the practical deployment of matrix-based optimizers in long-horizon training.

To push the boundaries of VLMs in remote sensing, we specifically address vehicle imagery captured by drones and introduce a spatially-aware dataset AirSpatial, which comprises over 206K instructions and introduces two novel tasks: Spatial Grounding and Spatial Question Answering. It is also the first remote sensing grounding dataset to provide 3DBB. To effectively leverage existing image understanding of VLMs to spatial domains, we adopt a two-stage training strategy comprising Image Understanding Pre-training and Spatial Understanding Fine-tuning. Utilizing this trained spatially-aware VLM, we develop an aerial agent, AirSpatialBot, which is capable of fine-grained vehicle attribute recognition and retrieval. By dynamically integrating task planning, image understanding, spatial understanding, and task execution capabilities, AirSpatialBot adapts to diverse query requirements.

While Transformers provide precise retrieval via the attention mechanism, their quadratic $\\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ complexity limits their application to long-horizon tasks. In this work, we propose the \\textbf{Spectral-Window Hybrid (SWH)}, an architecture that decouples sequence modeling into two \\textit{parallel} streams: a global branch utilizing the Convolution Theorem to model long-range decay dynamics in $\\mathcal{O}(T \\log T)$ time, and a local branch employing sliding-window attention for token interactions within a bounded context. By aggregating these representations, SWH avoids the computational bottleneck of global attention while retaining local precision. We demonstrate that SWH matches the perplexity of standard Transformers on short contexts while enabling efficient linear scaling to extended sequences.

We first introduce a novel data pipeline SyncID-Pipe that pre-trains an Identity-Anchored Video Synthesizer and combines it with IFS models to construct bidirectional ID quadruplets for explicit supervision. Building upon paired data, we propose the first Diffusion Transformer-based framework DreamID-V, employing a core Modality-Aware Conditioning module to discriminatively inject multi-model conditions. Meanwhile, we propose a Synthetic-to-Real Curriculum mechanism and an Identity-Coherence Reinforcement Learning strategy to enhance visual realism and identity consistency under challenging scenarios.

However, current methods remain impeded by drug data scarcity-induced cold-start challenge, closed label sets, and inadequate modeling of label dependencies. Here we propose an open-ended ADR prediction paradigm based on Graph-Motif feature fusion and Multi-Label Generation (GM-MLG). Leveraging molecular structure as an intrinsic and inherent feature, GM-MLG constructs a dual-graph representation architecture spanning the atomic level, the local molecular level (utilizing fine-grained motifs dynamically extracted via the BRICS algorithm combined with additional fragmentation rules), and the global molecular level. Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types.

Existing methods utilize global depth regularization to mitigate artifacts, leading to the loss of geometric boundary details. To address this problem, we propose EdgeNeRF, an edge-guided sparse-view 3D reconstruction algorithm. Our method leverages the prior that abrupt changes in depth and normals generate edges. Specifically, we first extract edges from input images, then apply depth and normal regularization constraints to non-edge regions, enhancing geometric consistency while preserving high-frequency details at boundaries. Experiments on LLFF and DTU datasets demonstrate EdgeNeRF's superior performance, particularly in retaining sharp geometric boundaries and suppressing artifacts. Additionally, the proposed edge-guided depth regularization module can be seamlessly integrated into other methods in a plug-and-play manner, significantly improving their performance without substantially increasing training time.

Here, practical AI assistance requires the seamless integration of domain literature knowledge with robust execution capabilities for expertise-intensive tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlamePilot, an LLM agent designed to empower combustion modeling research through automated and self-corrective CFD workflows. FlamePilot differentiates itself through an architecture that leverages atomic tools to ensure the robust setup and execution of complex simulations in both OpenFOAM and extended frameworks such as DeepFlame. The system is also capable of learning from scientific articles, extracting key information to guide the simulation from initial setup to optimized results. Validation on a public benchmark shows FlamePilot achieved a perfect 1.0 executability score and a 0.438 success rate, surpassing the prior best reported agent scores of 0.625 and 0.250, respectively. Furthermore, a detailed case study on Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion simulation demonstrates its efficacy as a collaborative research copilot, where FlamePilot autonomously translated a research paper into a configured simulation, conducted the simulation, post-processed the results, proposed evidence-based refinements, and managed a multi-step parameter study to convergence under minimal human intervention. By adopting a transparent and interpretable paradigm, FlamePilot establishes a foundational framework for AI-empowered combustion modeling, fostering a collaborative partnership where the agent manages workflow orchestration, freeing the researcher for high-level analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlamePilot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u71c3\u70e7\u5efa\u6a21\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u884cCFD\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4ece\u6587\u732e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4eff\u771f\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u6267\u884c\u3001\u540e\u5904\u7406\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u71c3\u70e7\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u6587\u732e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982CFD\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u7684\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u7684AI\u7814\u7a76\u8f85\u52a9\u3002", "method": "FlamePilot\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728OpenFOAM\u548cDeepFlame\u7b49\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4eff\u771f\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6307\u5bfc\u4ece\u521d\u59cb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5230\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFlamePilot\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.0\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u548c0.438\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u4ee3\u7406\u76840.625\u548c0.250\u5f97\u5206\u3002\u5728MILD\u71c3\u70e7\u4eff\u771f\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5c06\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6700\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u6b65\u53c2\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u76f4\u81f3\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "FlamePilot\u901a\u8fc7\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u8d4b\u80fd\u7684\u71c3\u70e7\u5efa\u6a21\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d1f\u8d23\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Existing methods attempt to address both tasks within a single unified stage. We question this design, as the annotation imbalance between known and unknown classes often leads to negative transfer of known classes and underfitting for unknowns. To overcome these issues, we propose SATS, a Separating-then-Adapting Training Strategy, which addresses OSDA-SS through two sequential steps: known/unknown separation and unknown-aware domain adaptation. By providing the model with more accurate and well-aligned unknown classes, our method ensures a balanced learning of discriminative features for both known and unknown classes, steering the model toward discovering truly unknown objects. Additionally, we present hard unknown exploration, an innovative data augmentation method that exposes the model to more challenging unknowns, strengthening its ability to capture more comprehensive understanding of target unknowns. We evaluate our method on public OSDA-SS benchmarks.

Furthermore, we conducted extensive experiments on PIN++, including part segmentation, object segmentation, and few-shot learning, exploring various ways to leverage part annotations in downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach not only enhanced part-based models for robust object recognition but also established strong baselines for multiple downstream tasks, highlighting the potential of part annotations in improving model performance.

When working on the model induction, selecting the right architecture for a given dataset often relies on repetitive trial-and-error procedures. This procedure is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and difficult to automate. While previous work has explored performance prediction using partial training or complex simulations, these methods often require significant computational overhead or lack generalizability. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: a lightweight, two-stage framework that can estimate model performance before training given the understanding of the dataset and the focused deep model structures. The first stage predicts a baseline based on the analysis of some measurable properties of the dataset, while the second stage adjusts the estimation with additional information on the model's architectural and hyperparameter details. The setup allows the framework to generalize across datasets and model types. Moreover, we find that some of the underlying features used for prediction - such as dataset variance - can offer practical guidance for model selection, and can serve as early indicators of data quality. As a result, the framework can be used not only to forecast model performance, but also to guide architecture choices, inform necessary preprocessing procedures, and detect potentially problematic datasets before training begins.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bd5\u9519\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7ec6\u8282\u8c03\u6574\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6307\u5bfc\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65b9\u5dee\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bd5\u9519\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we present the Decoupled-experts Arbitration Few-Shot SegNet (DA-FSS), a model that effectively distinguishes between semantic and geometric paths and mutually regularizes their gradients to achieve better generalization. DA-FSS employs the same backbone and pre-trained text encoder as MM-FSS to generate text embeddings, which can increase free modalities' utilization rate and better leverage each modality's information space. To achieve this, we propose a Parallel Expert Refinement module to generate each modal correlation. We also propose a Stacked Arbitration Module (SAM) to perform convolutional fusion and arbitrate correlations for each modality pathway. The Parallel Experts decouple two paths: a Geometric Expert maintains plasticity, and a Semantic Expert ensures stability. They are coordinated via a Decoupled Alignment Module (DAM) that transfers knowledge without propagating confusion.

To enhance model performance under variable system scales and improve robustness in branch power prediction, this paper proposes a Scale-adaptive Multi-task Power Flow Analysis (SaMPFA) framework. SaMPFA introduces a Local Topology Slicing (LTS) sampling technique that extracts subgraphs of different scales from the complete power network to strengthen the model's cross-scale learning capability. Furthermore, a Reference-free Multi-task Graph Learning (RMGL) model is designed for robust power flow prediction. Unlike existing approaches, RMGL predicts bus voltages and branch powers instead of phase angles. This design not only avoids the risk of error amplification in branch power calculation but also guides the model to learn the physical relationships of phase angle differences. In addition, the loss function incorporates extra terms that encourage the model to capture the physical patterns of angle differences and power transmission, further improving consistency between predictions and physical laws. Simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system and a real provincial grid in China demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior adaptability and generalization under variable system scales, with accuracy improvements of 4.47% and 36.82%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSaMPFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u62d3\u6251\u5207\u7247\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u529b\u6f6e\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5206\u652f\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6f6e\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u652f\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSaMPFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5c40\u90e8\u62d3\u6251\u5207\u7247\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u4ece\u5b8c\u6574\u7535\u7f51\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcd\u7ebf\u7535\u538b\u548c\u5206\u652f\u529f\u7387\u800c\u975e\u76f8\u89d2\uff0c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u52a0\u5165\u989d\u5916\u9879\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u89d2\u5dee\u548c\u529f\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE 39\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u7701\u7ea7\u7535\u7f51\u4e0a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53474.47%\u548c36.82%\u3002", "conclusion": "SaMPFA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u62d3\u6251\u5207\u7247\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6f6e\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Under a frozen-backbone calibration setting, we recover metric depth via an image-specific affine transform in inverse depth and train only lightweight calibration heads while keeping the relative-depth backbone and the CLIP text encoder fixed. Since captions provide coarse but noisy scale cues that vary with phrasing and missing objects, we use language to predict an uncertainty-aware envelope that bounds feasible calibration parameters in an unconstrained space, rather than committing to a text-only point estimate. We then use pooled multi-scale frozen visual features to select an image-specific calibration within this envelope. During training, a closed-form least-squares oracle in inverse depth provides per-image supervision for learning the envelope and the selected calibration.

The diverse and rapidly evolving data patterns pose significant challenges for online anomaly detection. Many existing anomaly detection methods are designed for offline settings or have difficulty in handling heterogeneous streaming data effectively. This paper proposes GDME, an unsupervised graph-based framework for online time series anomaly detection using model ensemble. GDME maintains a dynamic model pool that is continuously updated by pruning underperforming models and introducing new ones. It utilizes a dynamic graph structure to represent relationships among models and employs community detection on the graph to select an appropriate subset for ensemble.

However, a common challenge arises when working with medical images generated by different systems or even the same system with different parameter settings. Such images contain diverse textures and reverberation noise that violate the aforementioned assumption. Consequently, models trained on data from one device or setting often struggle to perform effectively with data from other devices or settings. In addition, retraining models for each specific device or setting is labor-intensive and costly. To address these issues in ultrasound images, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model. We formulated the domain adaptation tasks as an image-to-image translation task, in which we modified the texture patterns and removed reverberation noise in the test data images from the source domain to align with those in the target domain images while keeping the image content unchanged. We applied the proposed method to two datasets containing carotid ultrasound images from three different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully translated the texture pattern of images and removed reverberation noise from the ultrasound images. Furthermore, we evaluated the CycleGAN approaches for a comparative study with the proposed model. The experimental findings conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model achieved domain adaptation (histogram correlation (0.960 (0.019), & 0.920 (0.043) and bhattacharya distance (0.040 (0.020), & 0.085 (0.048)), compared to no adaptation (0.916 (0.062) & 0.890 (0.077), 0.090 (0.070) & 0.121 (0.095)) for both datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u56e0\u8bbe\u5907\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u6df7\u54cd\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u5907\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u6df7\u54cd\u566a\u58f0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GAN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u53bb\u9664\u6df7\u54cd\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f7f\u6e90\u57df\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5728\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u7684\u9888\u52a8\u8109\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u53bb\u9664\u4e86\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u54cd\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u4e0e\u65e0\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff080.960 vs 0.916\uff09\u548c\u5df4\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff080.040 vs 0.090\uff09\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684GAN-based\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u8de8\u57df\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u53bb\u9664\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This is the first unconditional super-linear lower bound for this fundamental operator at depths $k\\ge3$, and it holds even if the depth scales with $d$. Our proof technique is based on a combinatorial argument and associates the non-differentiable ridges of the maximum with cliques in a graph induced by the first hidden layer of the computing network, utilizing Tur\u00e1n's theorem from extremal graph theory to show that a sufficiently narrow network cannot capture the non-linearities of the maximum.

Since coastal scenarios are unpredictable and scenes have dynamic properties it is essential to apply detection methods that are robust to these conditions. This paper presents modified ViBe for moving object detection which detects ships and backwash. In the modified ViBe the probability of losing ships is decreased in comparison with the original ViBe. It is robust to natural sea waves and variation of lights and is capable of quickly updating the background.

Although EEG has been the gold standard for assessing mental workload, its limited portability restricts its real-world use. Widely available ECG through wearable devices proposes a pragmatic alternative. This research investigates whether ECG signals can reliably reflect cognitive load and serve as proxies for EEG-based indicators. In this work, we present multimodal data acquired from two different paradigms involving working-memory and passive-listening tasks. For each modality, we extracted ECG time-domain HRV metrics and Catch22 descriptors against EEG spectral and Catch22 features, respectively. We propose a cross-modal XGBoost framework to project the ECG features onto EEG-representative cognitive spaces, thereby allowing workload inferences using only ECG. Our results show that ECG-derived projections expressively capture variation in cognitive states and provide good support for accurate classification. Our findings underpin ECG as an interpretable, real-time, wearable solution for everyday cognitive monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff08ECG\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8111\u7535\u56fe\uff08EEG\uff09\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u76d1\u6d4b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5c06ECG\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230EEG\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ec5\u7528ECG\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8377\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136EEG\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4fbf\u643a\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u7528\u7684ECG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u53cd\u6620\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3aEEG\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u542c\u529b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6ECG\u65f6\u57dfHRV\u6307\u6807\u548cCatch22\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caEEG\u9891\u8c31\u548cCatch22\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001XGBoost\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06ECG\u7279\u5f81\u6295\u5f71\u5230EEG\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528ECG\u8fdb\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8377\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "ECG\u884d\u751f\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6355\u6349\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u826f\u597d\u652f\u6301\u3002ECG\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230EEG\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\u540e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528ECG\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "ECG\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Specifically, the preference verification reward computes mean verification scores from positive and negative samples as decision thresholds, providing positive feedback when prediction correctness aligns with answer correctness. Meanwhile, the advantage decoupled optimization computes separate advantages for generation and verification, applies token masks to isolate gradients, and combines masked GRPO objectives, preserving generation quality while calibrating verification scores.

By treating each finite-difference measurement as a noisy observation, BSZO builds a posterior distribution over the projected gradient and updates it through Bayesian inference, with a residual-based adaptive mechanism to adjust perturbation scales. Theoretical analysis shows that BSZO improves the convergence rate by a factor of $k/\u03b3$ compared to standard ZO methods. Experiments on RoBERTa, Mistral, and OPT models show that BSZO outperforms MeZO, MeZO-Adam, and HiZOO across various tasks, achieving up to 6.67\\% absolute average improvement on OPT-13B while keeping memory usage close to inference-only baselines (1.00$\\times$--1.08$\\times$ of MeZO).", "AI": {"tldr": "BSZO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfZO\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316(BSZO)\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6d4b\u91cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6784\u5efa\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u6574\u6270\u52a8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aBSZO\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6ZO\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8k/\u03b3\u500d\u3002\u5728RoBERTa\u3001Mistral\u548cOPT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBSZO\u4f18\u4e8eMeZO\u3001MeZO-Adam\u548cHiZOO\uff0c\u5728OPT-13B\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52306.67%\u7edd\u5bf9\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u63a5\u8fd1\u4ec5\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08MeZO\u76841.00-1.08\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "BSZO\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

AD, the primary driver of dementia, manifests through progressive cognitive and neuroanatomical changes like atrophy and ventricular expansion, making robust, generalizable classification essential for real-world use. While convolutional neural networks and transformers have advanced feature extraction via attention and fusion techniques, single-domain generalization (SDG) remains underexplored yet critical, given the fragmented nature of AD datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce Extended MixStyle (EM), a framework for blending higher-order feature moments (skewness and kurtosis) to mimic diverse distributional variations. Trained on sMRI data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; n=4,647) to differentiate persons with normal cognition (NC) from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and tested on three unseen cohorts (total n=3,126), EM yields enhanced cross-domain performance, improving macro-F1 on average by 2.4 percentage points over state-of-the-art SDG benchmarks, underscoring its promise for invariant, reliable AD detection in heterogeneous real-world settings.

These bounds are intrinsically data- and algorithm-dependent so that one can exploit the properties of data and algorithm to derive tighter bounds. However, we observe that although the flatness bias is crucial for SGD's generalization, these bounds fail to capture the improved generalization under better flatness and are also numerically loose. This is caused by the inadequate leverage of SGD's flatness bias in existing IT bounds. This paper derives a more flatness-leveraging IT bound for the flatness-favoring SGD. The bound indicates the learned models generalize better if the large-variance directions of the final weight covariance have small local curvatures in the loss landscape. Experiments on deep neural networks show our bound not only correctly reflects the better generalization when flatness is improved, but is also numerically much tighter. This is achieved by a flexible technique called \"omniscient trajectory\". When applied to Gradient Descent's minimax excess risk on convex-Lipschitz-Bounded problems, it improves representative IT bounds' $\u03a9(1)$ rates to $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$.

At present, diffusion inversion still remains a challenging task due to the lack of viable supervision signals. Thus, most existing methods resort to approximation-based solutions, which however are often at the cost of performance or efficiency. To remedy these shortcomings, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion inversion approach in this paper, termed Deep Inversion (DeepInv). Instead of requiring ground-truth noise annotations, we introduce a self-supervised objective as well as a data augmentation strategy to generate high-quality pseudo noises from real images without manual intervention. Based on these two innovative designs, DeepInv is also equipped with an iterative and multi-scale training regime to train a parameterized inversion solver, thereby achieving the fast and accurate image-to-noise mapping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of presenting a trainable solver to predict inversion noise step by step.

Although such storage-based GNN training methods have shown promising potential in large-scale GNN training, we observed that they suffer from a severe bottleneck in data preparation since they overlook a critical challenge: \\textit{how to handle a large number of small storage I/Os}. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel storage-based GNN training framework, named \\textsf{AGNES}, that employs a method of \\textit{block-wise storage I/O processing} to fully utilize the I/O bandwidth of high-performance storage devices. Moreover, to further enhance the efficiency of each storage I/O, \\textsf{AGNES} employs a simple yet effective strategy, \\textit{hyperbatch-based processing} based on the characteristics of real-world graphs. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world graphs reveal that \\textsf{AGNES} consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods, by up to 4.1$\\times$ faster than the best competitor.

Then, a deep teacher network extracts robust features from both original and synthetic data. Finally, a compact student network learns from the teacher via knowledge distillation, balancing generalization and computational efficiency.\n  Evaluated on a multi-center dataset of 1,435 cases, the synthetic images were of good quality.

However, the estimation error of diffusion models suffers from the curse of dimensionality $n^{-1/D}$ with the data dimension $D$. Since images are usually a union of low-dimensional manifolds, current works model the data as a union of linear subspaces with Gaussian latent and achieve a $1/\\sqrt{n}$ bound. Though this modeling reflects the multi-manifold property, the Gaussian latent can not capture the multi-modal property of the latent manifold. To bridge this gap, we propose the mixture subspace of low-rank mixture of Gaussian (MoLR-MoG) modeling, which models the target data as a union of $K$ linear subspaces, and each subspace admits a mixture of Gaussian latent ($n_k$ modals with dimension $d_k$). With this modeling, the corresponding score function naturally has a mixture of expert (MoE) structure, captures the multi-modal information, and contains nonlinear property. We first conduct real-world experiments to show that the generation results of MoE-latent MoG NN are much better than MoE-latent Gaussian score. Furthermore, MoE-latent MoG NN achieves a comparable performance with MoE-latent Unet with $10 \\times$ parameters. These results indicate that the MoLR-MoG modeling is reasonable and suitable for real-world data.

While KD has shown strong empirical success in numerous applications, its theoretical underpinnings remain only partially understood. In this work, we adopt a Bayesian perspective on KD to rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of students trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We study two regimes: $(i)$ when the teacher provides the exact Bayes Class Probabilities (BCPs); and $(ii)$ supervision with noisy approximations of the BCPs. Our analysis shows that learning from BCPs yields variance reduction and removes neighborhood terms in the convergence bounds compared to one-hot supervision. We further characterize how the level of noise affects generalization and accuracy. Motivated by these insights, we advocate the use of Bayesian deep learning models, which typically provide improved estimates of the BCPs, as teachers in KD. Consistent with our analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that students distilled from Bayesian teachers not only achieve higher accuracies (up to +4.27%), but also exhibit more stable convergence (up to 30% less noise), compared to students distilled from deterministic teachers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u6539\u5584\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5021\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08KD\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4f46\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790KD\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a1\uff09\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u6982\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u6982\u7387\u3002\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08SGD\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5021\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6536\u655b\u8fb9\u754c\u4e2d\u53bb\u9664\u90bb\u57df\u9879\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53474.27%\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe30%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution, but current methods remain inefficient and often fail to maintain high answer quality. To address these challenges, we propose VideoSpeculateRAG, an efficient VLM-based RAG framework built on two key ideas. First, we introduce a speculative decoding pipeline: a lightweight draft model quickly generates multiple answer candidates, which are then verified and refined by a more accurate heavyweight model, substantially reducing inference latency without sacrificing correctness.

Modeling their global activity on large timescales is therefore a critical yet challenging task. While deep learning has recently achieved significant breakthroughs in global weather forecasting, its potential for global wildfire behavior prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we reframe this problem and introduce the Hierarchical Graph ODE (HiGO), a novel framework designed to learn the multi-scale, continuous-time dynamics of wildfires. Specifically, we represent the Earth system as a multi-level graph hierarchy and propose an adaptive filtering message passing mechanism for both intra- and inter-level information flow, enabling more effective feature extraction and fusion.

In autonomous driving, this vision gives rise to driving world models: generative simulators that imagine ego and agent futures, enabling scalable simulation, safe testing of corner cases, and rich synthetic data generation. Yet, despite fast-growing research activity, the field lacks a rigorous benchmark to measure progress and guide priorities. Existing evaluations remain limited: generic video metrics overlook safety-critical imaging factors; trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified; temporal and agent-level consistency is neglected; and controllability with respect to ego conditioning is ignored. Moreover, current datasets fail to cover the diversity of conditions required for real-world deployment. To address these gaps, we present DrivingGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for generative driving world models. DrivingGen combines a diverse evaluation dataset curated from both driving datasets and internet-scale video sources, spanning varied weather, time of day, geographic regions, and complex maneuvers, with a suite of new metrics that jointly assess visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art models reveals clear trade-offs: general models look better but break physics, while driving-specific ones capture motion realistically but lag in visual quality.

Traditional basin attributes describe some of these differences, but they cannot fully represent the complexity of natural environments. This study examines whether AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, which are learned from large collections of satellite images rather than designed by experts, offer a more informative way to describe basin characteristics. These embeddings summarize patterns in vegetation, land surface properties, and long-term environmental dynamics. We find that models using them achieve higher accuracy when predicting flows in basins not used for training, suggesting that they capture key physical differences more effectively than traditional attributes. We further investigate how selecting appropriate donor basins influences prediction in ungauged regions. Similarity based on the embeddings helps identify basins with comparable environmental and hydrological behavior, improving performance, whereas adding many dissimilar basins can reduce accuracy. The results show that satellite-informed environmental representations can strengthen hydrological forecasting and support the development of models that adapt more easily to different landscapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u57df\u5c5e\u6027\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u65e0\u8d44\u6599\u5730\u533a\u6cb3\u6d41\u6d41\u91cf", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u57df\u5c5e\u6027\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u81ea\u7136\u73af\u5883\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u65e0\u6c34\u6587\u8bb0\u5f55\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6cb3\u6d41\u6d41\u91cf", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528AlphaEarth Foundation\u5d4c\u5165\uff08\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8868\u793a\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6d41\u57df\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4f9b\u4f53\u6d41\u57df", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6d41\u57df\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u4f9b\u4f53\u6d41\u57df\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u536b\u661f\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u6c34\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u6c34\u6587\u6a21\u578b"}}

This flexible tokenization is typically achieved through nested dropout, where a portion of trailing tokens is randomly truncated during training, and the image is reconstructed using the remaining preceding sequence. However, this tail-truncation strategy inherently concentrates the image information in the early tokens, limiting the effectiveness of downstream AutoRegressive (AR) image generation as the token length increases. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ReToK}, a flexible tokenizer with \\underline{Re}dundant \\underline{Tok}en Padding and Hierarchical Semantic Regularization, designed to fully exploit all tokens for enhanced latent modeling. Specifically, we introduce \\textbf{Redundant Token Padding} to activate tail tokens more frequently, thereby alleviating information over-concentration in the early tokens. In addition, we apply \\textbf{Hierarchical Semantic Regularization} to align the decoding features of earlier tokens with those from a pre-trained vision foundation model, while progressively reducing the regularization strength toward the tail to allow finer low-level detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReTok: on ImageNet 256$\\times$256, our method achieves superior generation performance compared with both flexible and fixed-length tokenizers.

We prove that surrogate rewards exhibit Balanced Gradient Attribution, while SFT and KL penalties exhibit Unbalanced Gradient Attribution, with length-weighting creating asymmetric regularization that constrains $\u03c0_{sample}$ while leaving $\u03c0_{d}$ under-optimized, providing an theoretical explanation of why RL succeeds where SFT fails.

Deep learning-based Radar Echo Extrapolation (REE) has become a predominant nowcasting approach, yet it suffers from poor generalization due to its reliance on high-quality local training data and static model parameters, limiting its applicability across diverse regions and extreme events. To overcome this, we propose REE-TTT, a novel model that incorporates an adaptive Test-Time Training (TTT) mechanism. The core of our model lies in the newly designed Spatio-temporal Test-Time Training (ST-TTT) block, which replaces the standard linear projections in TTT layers with task-specific attention mechanisms, enabling robust adaptation to non-stationary meteorological distributions and thereby significantly enhancing the feature representation of precipitation. Experiments under cross-regional extreme precipitation scenarios demonstrate that REE-TTT substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction accuracy and generalization, exhibiting remarkable adaptability to data distribution shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faREE-TTT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u56de\u6ce2\u5916\u63a8\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u56de\u6ce2\u5916\u63a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREE-TTT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6c14\u8c61\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u6781\u7aef\u964d\u6c34\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cREE-TTT\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "REE-TTT\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u964d\u6c34\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a real-time Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)-based framework tailored for industrial applications, with a focus on identical motor-driven loads representing textile cutting machines. A hardware setup comprising voltage and current sensors, Arduino Mega and ESP8266 was developed to capture aggregate and individual load data, which was stored and processed on cloud platforms. A new dataset was created from three identical induction motors and auxiliary loads, totaling over 180,000 samples, to evaluate the state-of-the-art MATNILM model under challenging industrial conditions. Results indicate that while aggregate energy estimation was reasonably accurate, per-appliance disaggregation faced difficulties, particularly when multiple identical machines operated simultaneously. Despite these challenges, the integrated system demonstrated practical real-time monitoring with remote accessibility through the Blynk application.

This challenge persists in automated Few-shot Font Generation (FFG), where models often struggle to preserve both the structural integrity and stylistic fidelity from limited references. While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, their application to FFG is constrained by conventional patch-level tokenization, which neglects global dependencies crucial for coherent font synthesis. Moreover, existing FFG methods remain within the image-to-image paradigm, relying solely on visual references and overlooking the role of language in conveying stylistic intent during font design. To address these limitations, we propose GAR-Font, a novel AR framework for multimodal few-shot font generation.

However, existing methods typically assume full client availability, which is rarely practical. In real-world FL systems, clients often participate in a cyclic manner: joining training according to a fixed, repeating schedule. This setting poses unique optimization challenges for the non-decomposable AUC objective. This paper addresses these challenges by developing and analyzing communication-efficient algorithms for federated AUC maximization under cyclic client participation. We investigate two key settings: First, we study AUC maximization with a squared surrogate loss, which reformulates the problem as a nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. By leveraging the Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz (PL) condition, we establish a state-of-the-art communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\u03b5^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\u03b5)$. Second, we consider general pairwise AUC losses. We establish a communication complexity of $O(1/\u03b5^3)$ and an iteration complexity of $O(1/\u03b5^4)$. Further, under the PL condition, these bounds improve to communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\u03b5^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\u03b5)$.

Recent works have leveraged the inherent redundancy in visual content to make training more affordable by training only on a subset of visual information. While these methods were successful in providing cheaper and more effective training, sparsely trained diffusion models struggle in inference. This is due to their lacking response to Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) leading to underwhelming performance during inference. To overcome this, we propose Sparse Guidance (SG). Instead of using conditional dropout as a signal to guide diffusion models, SG uses token-level sparsity. As a result, SG preserves the high-variance of the conditional prediction better, achieving good quality and high variance outputs. Leveraging token-level sparsity at inference, SG improves fidelity at lower compute, achieving 1.58 FID on the commonly used ImageNet-256 benchmark with 25% fewer FLOPs, and yields up to 58% FLOP savings at matched baseline quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Sparse Guidance, we train a 2.5B text-to-image diffusion model using training time sparsity and leverage SG during inference.

Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare.

While such prompts can embed prior knowledge about diagnostic quality, they often introduce bias by reflecting idealized definitions that may not hold under real-world degradations such as noise, motion artifacts, or scanner variability. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Prompt-guided Image Quality Assessment (CAP-IQA) framework, which integrates text-level priors with instance-level context prompts and applies causal debiasing to separate idealized knowledge from factual, image-specific degradations. Our framework combines a CNN-based visual encoder with a domain-specific text encoder to assess diagnostic visibility, anatomical clarity, and noise perception in abdominal CT images. The model leverages radiology-style prompts and context-aware fusion to align semantic and perceptual representations. On the 2023 LDCTIQA challenge benchmark, CAP-IQA achieves an overall correlation score of 2.8590 (sum of PLCC, SROCC, and KROCC), surpassing the top-ranked leaderboard team (2.7427) by 4.24%. Moreover, our comprehensive ablation experiments confirm that prompt-guided fusion and the simplified encoder-only design jointly enhance feature alignment and interpretability. Furthermore, evaluation on an in-house dataset of 91,514 pediatric CT images demonstrates the true generalizability of CAP-IQA in assessing perceptual fidelity in a different patient population.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCAP-IQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CT\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728LDCTIQA\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CT\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u53d8\u5f02\u7b49\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCAP-IQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u7ea7\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u53bb\u504f\u5206\u79bb\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u3002\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u98ce\u683c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u57282023\u5e74LDCTIQA\u6311\u6218\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCAP-IQA\u83b7\u5f97\u603b\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f97\u52062.8590\uff08PLCC\u3001SROCC\u548cKROCC\u4e4b\u548c\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6392\u884c\u699c\u7b2c\u4e00\u540d\uff082.7427\uff094.24%\u3002\u5728\u5305\u542b91,514\u5f20\u513f\u79d1CT\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u81ea\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CAP-IQA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60a3\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aCT\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A recurring practical issue is that standard mini-batch training can be unstable when trajectory lengths are highly heterogeneous, which in turn degrades \\emph{distribution matching} for trajectory-derived statistics. We propose \\textbf{length-aware sampling (LAS)}, a simple batching strategy that groups trajectories by length and samples batches from a single length bucket, reducing within-batch length heterogeneity (and making updates more consistent) without changing the model class. We integrate LAS into a conditional trajectory GAN with auxiliary time-alignment losses and provide (i) a distribution-level guarantee for derived variables under mild boundedness assumptions, and (ii) an IPM/Wasserstein mechanism explaining why LAS improves distribution matching by removing length-only shortcut critics and targeting within-bucket discrepancies. Empirically, LAS consistently improves matching of derived-variable distributions on a multi-mall dataset of shopper trajectories and on diverse public sequence datasets (GPS, education, e-commerce, and movies), outperforming random sampling across dataset-specific metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837(LAS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6309\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u7ec4\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6279\u6b21\u5185\u957f\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u53d8\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8f68\u8ff9\u884d\u751f\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u8d28\u91cf", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837(LAS)\uff1a\u6309\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u957f\u5ea6\u6876\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u6279\u6b21\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6279\u6b21\u5185\u957f\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u8f68\u8ff9GAN\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931", "result": "LAS\u5728\u591a\u5546\u573a\u8d2d\u7269\u8005\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u516c\u5171\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6(GPS\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u3001\u7535\u5f71)\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u5584\u884d\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5339\u914d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837", "conclusion": "LAS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6279\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6279\u6b21\u5185\u957f\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u53d8\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f18\u52bf"}}

Our key contribution is Deep Gaussian Shadow Maps (DGSM), a modern analogue of the classical shadow mapping algorithm tailored to the volumetric 3DGS representation. Building on the classic deep shadow mapping idea, we show that 3DGS admits closed form light accumulation along light rays, enabling volumetric shadow computation without meshing. For each estimated light, we tabulate transmittance over concentric radial shells and store them in octahedral atlases, which modern GPUs can sample in real time per query to attenuate affected scene Gaussians and thus cast and receive shadows consistently. To relight moving avatars, we approximate the local environment illumination with HDRI probes represented in a spherical harmonic (SH) basis and apply a fast per Gaussian radiance transfer, avoiding explicit BRDF estimation or offline optimization. We demonstrate environment consistent lighting for avatars from AvatarX and ActorsHQ, composited into ScanNet++, DL3DV, and SuperSplat scenes, and show interactions with inserted objects. Across single and multi avatar settings, DGSM and SH relighting operate fully in the volumetric 3DGS representation, yielding coherent shadows and relighting while avoiding meshing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDeep Gaussian Shadow Maps (DGSM)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85(3DGS)\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5149\u7167\u548c\u9634\u5f71\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85(3DGS)\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5149\u7167\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u800c3DGS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faDeep Gaussian Shadow Maps (DGSM)\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6df1\u5ea6\u9634\u5f71\u6620\u5c04\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u9488\u5bf93DGS\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u30022. \u5229\u75283DGS\u6cbf\u5149\u7ebf\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5149\u79ef\u7d2f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u9634\u5f71\u8ba1\u7b97\u30023. \u4f7f\u7528\u516b\u9762\u4f53\u56fe\u96c6\u5b58\u50a8\u540c\u5fc3\u5f84\u5411\u58f3\u7684\u900f\u5c04\u7387\uff0cGPU\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u30024. \u4f7f\u7528\u7403\u8c10(Spherical Harmonic)\u57fa\u8868\u793a\u7684HDRI\u63a2\u9488\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5c40\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u6bcf\u9ad8\u65af\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u5728AvatarX\u3001ActorsHQ\u89d2\u8272\u4e0eScanNet++\u3001DL3DV\u3001SuperSplat\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\u3002\u652f\u6301\u5355\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u4f53\u79ef3DGS\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DGSM\u548cSH\u91cd\u65b0\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u4f53\u79ef3DGS\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a3DGS\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, the robustness of these learning-based solvers has remained insufficiently explored, especially across diverse and complex problem distributions. In this paper, we propose a unified robustness-oriented framework for preference-conditioned DRL solvers for MOCOPs. Within this framework, we develop a preference-based adversarial attack to generate hard instances that expose solver weaknesses, and quantify the attack impact by the resulting degradation on Pareto-front quality. We further introduce a defense strategy that integrates hardness-aware preference selection into adversarial training to reduce overfitting to restricted preference regions and improve out-of-distribution performance. The experimental results on multi-objective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP), multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem (MOCVRP), and multi-objective knapsack problem (MOKP) verify that our attack method successfully learns hard instances for different solvers. Furthermore, our defense method significantly strengthens the robustness and generalizability of neural solvers, delivering superior performance on hard or out-of-distribution instances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898DRL\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u751f\u6210\u56f0\u96be\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u786c\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u56f0\u96be\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u786c\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u53d7\u9650\u504f\u597d\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff1b4) \u5728MOTSP\u3001MOCVRP\u548cMOKP\u4e09\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210\u56f0\u96be\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684DRL\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, evaluating these systems is challenging, as it requires realistic, end-to-end research scenarios that integrate data analysis, interpretation, and the generation of new insights from the experimental data. To address this limitation, we introduce HeurekaBench, a framework to create benchmarks with exploratory, open-ended research questions for experimental datasets. Each such question is grounded in a scientific study and its corresponding code repository, and is created using a semi-automated pipeline that leverages multiple LLMs to extract insights and generate candidate workflows, which are then verified against reported findings. We instantiate the framework in single-cell biology to obtain sc-HeurekaBench benchmark and use it to compare state-of-the-art single-cell agents. We further showcase the benefits of our benchmark for quantitatively analyzing current design choices in agentic systems. We find that the addition of a critic module can improve ill-formed responses for open-source LLM-based agents by up to 22% and close the gap with their closed-source counterparts.

Accurate wildfire risk prediction is hindered by the intrinsic stochasticity of ignition and spread and by nonlinear interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, climate variability, topography, and human activities, challenging the reliability and interpretability of purely data-driven models. We propose a trustworthy data-driven wildfire risk prediction framework based on long-sequence, multi-scale temporal modeling, which integrates heterogeneous drivers while explicitly quantifying predictive uncertainty and enabling process-level interpretation. Evaluated over western Canada during the record-breaking 2023 and 2024 fire seasons, the proposed model outperforms existing time-series approaches, achieving an F1 score of 0.90 and a PR-AUC of 0.98 with low computational cost. Uncertainty-aware analysis reveals structured spatial and seasonal patterns in predictive confidence, highlighting increased uncertainty associated with ambiguous predictions and spatiotemporal decision boundaries. SHAP-based interpretation provides mechanistic understanding of wildfire controls, showing that temperature-related drivers dominate wildfire risk in both years, while moisture-related constraints play a stronger role in shaping spatial and land-cover-specific contrasts in 2024 compared to the widespread hot and dry conditions of 2023.

While Data-Free Model Extraction (DFME) has emerged as a stealthy vector, it remains fundamentally constrained by the \"Cold Start\" problem: GAN-based adversaries waste thousands of queries converging from random noise to meaningful data. We propose DiMEx, a framework that weaponizes the rich semantic priors of pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models to bypass this initialization barrier entirely. By employing Random Embedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO) within the generator's latent space, DiMEx synthesizes high-fidelity queries immediately, achieving 52.1 percent agreement on SVHN with just 2,000 queries - outperforming state-of-the-art GAN baselines by over 16 percent. To counter this highly semantic threat, we introduce the Hybrid Stateful Ensemble (HSE) defense, which identifies the unique \"optimization trajectory\" of latent-space attacks. Our results demonstrate that while DiMEx evades static distribution detectors, HSE exploits this temporal signature to suppress attack success rates to 21.6 percent with negligible latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiMEx\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u7a83\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\"\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u9632\u5fa1\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u578b\u7a83\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5373\u670d\u52a1\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u9762\u4e34\"\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\"\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiMEx\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5d4c\u5165\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08REMBO\uff09\u7acb\u5373\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u6210\uff08HSE\uff09\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u72ec\u7279\"\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\"\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "DiMEx\u5728SVHN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ec5\u75282000\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u5c31\u8fbe\u523052.1%\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684GAN\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad8\u51fa16%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002HSE\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6291\u5236\u523021.6%\uff0c\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "DiMEx\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u7a83\u53d6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u800cHSE\u9632\u5fa1\u5219\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aMLaaS\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u9632\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This study evaluates the performance of four deep learning-based face recognition models FaceNet, ArcFace, MagFace, and CosFace on a newly developed longitudinal dataset collected over a 24 month period in seven sessions involving children aged 0 to 3 years. Our analysis examines recognition accuracy across developmental stages, showing that the True Accept Rate (TAR) is only 30.7% at 0.1% False Accept Rate (FAR) for infants aged 0 to 6 months, due to unstable facial features. Performance improves significantly in older children, reaching 64.7% TAR at 0.1% FAR in the 2.5 to 3 year age group. We also evaluate verification performance over different time intervals, revealing that shorter time gaps result in higher accuracy due to reduced embedding drift. To mitigate this drift, we apply a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) approach that improves TAR by over 12%, yielding features that are more temporally stable and generalizable. These findings are critical for building biometric systems that function reliably over time in smart city applications such as public healthcare, child safety, and digital identity services. The challenges observed in early age groups highlight the importance of future research on privacy preserving biometric authentication systems that can address temporal variability, particularly in secure and regulated urban environments where child verification is essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff080-6\u4e2a\u6708\u4ec530.7% TAR\uff09\uff0c\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u957f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff082.5-3\u5c81\u8fbe64.7% TAR\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528DANN\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd12%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9762\u90e8\u5f62\u6001\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7c7b\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\u513f\u7ae5\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff080-3\u5c81\u513f\u7ae5\uff0c7\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff0c24\u4e2a\u6708\u8de8\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff1aFaceNet\u3001ArcFace\u3001MagFace\u548cCosFace\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DANN\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "0-6\u4e2a\u6708\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u4f4e\uff080.1% FAR\u4e0bTAR\u4ec530.7%\uff09\uff0c\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u957f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c2.5-3\u5c81\u7ec4\u8fbe64.7% TAR\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u8d8a\u77ed\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8a\u9ad8\u3002DANN\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7279\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347TAR\u8d85\u8fc712%\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u65e9\u671f\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7DANN\u7b49\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\u513f\u7ae5\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u672a\u6765\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, the efficiency of these prediction sets, measured by their size, depends on the choice of the underlying learning model. Relying on a single fixed model may lead to suboptimal performance in online environments, as a single model may not consistently perform well across all time steps. To mitigate this, prior work has explored selecting a model from a set of candidates. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive as the number of candidate models increases. Moreover, poorly performing models in the set may also hinder the effectiveness. To tackle this challenge, this work develops a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that reduces computational complexity and improves prediction efficiency. At each time step, a bipartite graph is generated to identify a subset of effective models, from which a model is selected to construct the prediction set. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing multi-model conformal prediction techniques in terms of both prediction set size and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u4f4e\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u672f", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02"}}

Despite advancements in AI, clinically viable segmentation is often hindered by the scarcity of 3D annotations, patient-specific variability, data privacy concerns, and substantial computational overhead. In this work, we propose FALCON, a cross-domain few-shot segmentation framework that achieves high-precision 3D volume segmentation by processing data as 2D slices. The framework is first meta-trained on natural images to learn-to-learn generalizable segmentation priors, then transferred to the medical domain via adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning. Task-aware inference, conditioned on support cues, allows FALCON to adapt dynamically to patient-specific anatomical variations across slices. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that FALCON consistently achieves the lowest Hausdorff Distance scores, indicating superior boundary accuracy while maintaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient comparable to the state-of-the-art models.

Recently, with the advent of digital twins and data-driven decision-making, several statistical and machine-learning methods have been proposed. However, these methods face several challenges, such as dependence on only real sensor datasets, limited labeled data, high false alarm rates, and privacy concerns. To address these problems, we propose a suite of digital twin-integrated federated learning (DTFL) methods that enhance global model performance while preserving data privacy and communication efficiency. Specifically, we present five novel approaches: Digital Twin-Based Meta-Learning (DTML), Federated Parameter Fusion (FPF), Layer-wise Parameter Exchange (LPE), Cyclic Weight Adaptation (CWA), and Digital Twin Knowledge Distillation (DTKD). Each method introduces a unique mechanism to combine synthetic and real-world knowledge, balancing generalization with communication overhead. We conduct an extensive experiment using a publicly available cyber-physical anomaly detection dataset. For a target accuracy of 80%, CWA reaches the target in 33 rounds, FPF in 41 rounds, LPE in 48 rounds, and DTML in 87 rounds, whereas the standard FedAvg baseline and DTKD do not reach the target within 100 rounds. These results highlight substantial communication-efficiency gains (up to 62% fewer rounds than DTML and 31% fewer than LPE) and demonstrate that integrating DT knowledge into FL accelerates convergence to operationally meaningful accuracy thresholds for IIoT anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u96c6\u6210\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(DTFL)\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u6536\u655b\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u4f9d\u8d56\u771f\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u79cd\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u96c6\u6210\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aDTML\uff08\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u3001FPF\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u878d\u5408\uff09\u3001LPE\uff08\u5206\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u4ea4\u6362\uff09\u3001CWA\uff08\u5faa\u73af\u6743\u91cd\u9002\u5e94\uff09\u548cDTKD\uff08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e73\u8861\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCWA\u572833\u8f6e\u8fbe\u523080%\u76ee\u6807\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cFPF\u572841\u8f6e\uff0cLPE\u572848\u8f6e\uff0cDTML\u572887\u8f6e\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6FedAvg\u548cDTKD\u5728100\u8f6e\u5185\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u3002CWA\u6bd4DTML\u51cf\u5c1162%\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6b21\uff0c\u6bd4LPE\u51cf\u5c1131%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work investigates whether synthetic face data can act as a longitudinal stabilizer by improving temporal robustness of child face recognition models. Using an identity disjoint protocol on the Young Face Aging (YFA) dataset, we evaluate three settings: (i) pretrained MagFace embeddings without dataset specific fine-tuning, (ii) MagFace fine-tuned using authentic training faces only, and (iii) MagFace fine-tuned using a combination of authentic and synthetically generated training faces. Synthetic data is generated using StyleGAN2 ADA and incorporated exclusively within the training identities; a post generation filtering step is applied to mitigate identity leakage and remove artifact affected samples. Experimental results across enrollment verification gaps from 6 to 36 months show that synthetic-augmented fine tuning substantially reduces error rates relative to both the pretrained baseline and real only fine tuning.

Still, vanilla random sampling from LMs yields low quality generations. Decoding algorithms attempt to restrict the LM distribution to a set of high-probability continuations, but rely on greedy heuristics that introduce myopic distortions, yielding sentences that are homogeneous, repetitive and incoherent. In this paper, we introduce EPIC, a hyperparameter-free decoding approach that incorporates the entropy of future trajectories into LM decoding. EPIC explicitly regulates the amount of uncertainty expressed at every step of generation, aligning the sampling distribution's entropy to the aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Through Entropy-Aware Lazy Gumbel-Max sampling, EPIC manages to be exact, while also being efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of entropy evaluations per step. Unlike current baselines, EPIC yields sampling distributions that are empirically well-aligned with the entropy of the underlying data distribution. Across creative writing and summarization tasks, EPIC consistently improves LM-as-judge preference win-rates over widely used decoding strategies. These preference gains are complemented by automatic metrics, showing that EPIC produces more diverse generations and more faithful summaries.

Submitted to CVPR 2026", "summary": "Roadside perception datasets are typically constructed via cooperative labeling between synchronized vehicle and roadside frame pairs. However, real deployment often requires annotation of roadside-only data due to hardware and privacy constraints. Even human experts struggle to produce accurate labels without vehicle-side data (image, LIDAR), which not only increases annotation difficulty and cost, but also reveals a fundamental learnability problem: many roadside-only scenes contain distant, blurred, or occluded objects whose 3D properties are ambiguous from a single view and can only be reliably annotated by cross-checking paired vehicle--roadside frames. We refer to such cases as inherently ambiguous samples. To reduce wasted annotation effort on inherently ambiguous samples while still obtaining high-performing models, we turn to active learning. This work focuses on active learning for roadside monocular 3D object detection and proposes a learnability-driven framework that selects scenes which are both informative and reliably labelable, suppressing inherently ambiguous samples while ensuring coverage. Experiments demonstrate that our method, LH3D, achieves 86.06%, 67.32%, and 78.67% of full-performance for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists respectively, using only 25% of the annotation budget on DAIR-V2X-I, significantly outperforming uncertainty-based baselines. This confirms that learnability, not uncertainty, matters for roadside 3D perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "LH3D\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u8def\u8fb9\u5355\u76ee3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u65e2\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u53c8\u53ef\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ec5\u752825%\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u6807\u6ce8\u8def\u8fb9\u5355\u76ee\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u573a\u666f\u5b58\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdc\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u51763D\u5c5e\u6027\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u770b\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8f66\u8f86-\u8def\u8fb9\u914d\u5bf9\u5e27\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u624d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8fd9\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLH3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u8def\u8fb9\u5355\u76ee3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u65e2\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u53c8\u53ef\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6837\u672c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4", "result": "\u5728DAIR-V2X-I\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752825%\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u884c\u4eba\u548c\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u768486.06%\u300167.32%\u548c78.67%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8def\u8fb93D\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u624d\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0cLH3D\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b"}}

However, it remains unclear how they can process grammatical syntax. In fact, under standard complexity conjectures, standard transformers cannot recognize context-free languages (CFLs), a canonical formalism to describe syntax, or even regular languages, a subclass of CFLs (Merrill et al., 2022). Merrill & Sabharwal (2024) show that $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length $n$) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open. In this work, we show that looped transformers with $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers and $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens can recognize all CFLs. However, training and inference with $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens is potentially impractical. Fortunately, we show that, for natural subclasses such as unambiguous CFLs, the recognition problem on transformers becomes more tractable, requiring $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ padding. We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5faa\u73afTransformer\uff08\u5e26O(log n)\u5faa\u73af\u5c42\u548cO(n^6)\u586b\u5145token\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981O(n^3)\u586b\u5145\u6765\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u7136\u5b50\u7c7b\u5982\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49CFL", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1Transformer\u5728\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7b49\u7b26\u5408\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\uff08CFL\uff09\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u6b63\u5219\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5faa\u73af\u5c42\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bc6\u522b\u6b63\u5219\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46CFL\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u5f00\u653e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7O(log n)\u5faa\u73af\u5c42\u548cO(n^6)\u586b\u5145token\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6240\u6709CFL\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u7136\u5b50\u7c7b\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49CFL\uff09\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u9700O(n^3)\u586b\u5145token\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709CFL\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u586b\u5145token\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49CFL\u7b49\u81ea\u7136\u5b50\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700O(n^3)\u586b\u5145\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u673a\u5236\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CFL\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9Transformer\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u901a\u7528\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u586b\u5145token\u800c\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5faa\u73af\u673a\u5236\u4e3aTransformer\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements ranging from 0.01% to 1.5%.

In response, regulations such as European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate the deletion of PII upon requests, underscoring the need for reliable and cost-effective data removal solutions. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising direction for selectively forgetting data points. However, existing unlearning techniques typically apply a uniform forgetting strategy that neither accounts for the varying privacy risks posed by different PII attributes nor reflects associated business risks. In this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning approach that prioritizes forgetting based on the risk of individual or combined PII attributes. To this end, we introduce the PII risk index (PRI), a composite metric that incorporates multiple dimensions of risk factors: identifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy. The PRI enables a nuanced evaluation of privacy risks associated with PII exposures and can be tailored to align with organizational privacy policies. To support realistic assessment, we systematically construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that simulates realistic exposure scenarios. UnPII seamlessly integrates with established unlearning algorithms, such as Gradient Ascent, Negative Preference Optimization, and Direct Preference Optimization, without modifying their underlying principles. Our experimental results demonstrate that UnPII achieves the improvements of accuracy up to 11.8%, utility up to 6.3%, and generalizability up to 12.4%, respectively, while incurring a modest fine-tuning overhead of 27.5% on average during unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "UnPII\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8ePII\u98ce\u9669\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PII\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6570\uff08PRI\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u9057\u5fd8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5408\u89c4\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u654f\u611f\u4e2a\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\uff08PII\uff09\u65f6\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\u3002GDPR\u7b49\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u6309\u9700\u5220\u9664PII\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540cPII\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUnPII\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165PII\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6570\uff08PRI\uff09\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u94fe\u63a5\u6027\u3001\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u66b4\u9732\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4e03\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210PII\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff081700\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u66b4\u9732\u573a\u666f\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u8d1f\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u7b97\u6cd5\u539f\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUnPII\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534711.8%\uff0c\u6548\u7528\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53476.3%\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534712.4%\u3002\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u4ea7\u751f27.5%\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "UnPII\u662f\u9996\u4e2aPII\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We identify the root cause of this limitation as the inadequacy of current training datasets, which are often too short, low-resolution, and lack the task diversity required to teach robust temporal priors. To address this foundational data gap, we first introduce FFP-300K, a new large-scale dataset comprising 300K high-fidelity video pairs at 720p resolution and 81 frames in length, constructed via a principled two-track pipeline for diverse local and global edits. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework designed for true guidance-free FFP that resolves the critical tension between maintaining first-frame appearance and preserving source video motion. Architecturally, we introduce Adaptive Spatio-Temporal RoPE (AST-RoPE), which dynamically remaps positional encodings to disentangle appearance and motion references. At the objective level, we employ a self-distillation strategy where an identity propagation task acts as a powerful regularizer, ensuring long-term temporal stability and preventing semantic drift.

The submission includes 7 figures (fig1 to fig7) that visually support the technical analysis", "summary": "Masked autoencoders (MAE) have become a dominant paradigm in 3D representation learning, setting new performance benchmarks across various downstream tasks. Existing methods with fixed mask ratio neglect multi-level representational correlations and intrinsic geometric structures, while relying on point-wise reconstruction assumptions that conflict with the diversity of point cloud. To address these issues, we propose a 3D representation learning method, termed Point-SRA, which aligns representations through self-distillation and probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we assign different masking ratios to the MAE to capture complementary geometric and semantic information, while the MeanFlow Transformer (MFT) leverages cross-modal conditional embeddings to enable diverse probabilistic reconstruction. Our analysis further reveals that representations at different time steps in MFT also exhibit complementarity. Therefore, a Dual Self-Representation Alignment mechanism is proposed at both the MAE and MFT levels.

However, the dependence on a single central server is challenging in the case of a large number of clients and even poses the risk of a single point of failure. To address these critical limitations of scalability and fault-tolerance, we present a distributed approach to federated learning comprising multiple servers with inter-server communication capabilities. While providing a fully decentralized approach, the designed framework retains the core federated learning structure where each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients with server-client communication capabilities. We propose a novel DFL (Distributed Federated Learning) algorithm which uses alternating periods of local training on the client data followed by global training among servers. We show that the DFL algorithm, under a suitable choice of parameters, ensures that all the servers converge to a common model value within a small tolerance of the ideal model, thus exhibiting effective integration of local and global training models.

Achieving seamless conversational behavior, where speaking and listening states transition fluidly remains a key challenge. Existing 3D conversational avatar approaches rely on error-prone pseudo-3D labels that fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage framework MANGO, which leveraging pure image-level supervision by alternately training to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo-3D labels, thereby achieving better alignment with real-world conversational behaviors. Specifically, in the first stage, a diffusion-based transformer with a dual-audio interaction module models natural 3D motion from multi-speaker audio. In the second stage, we use a fast 3D Gaussian Renderer to generate high-fidelity images and provide 2D-level photometric supervision for the 3D motions through alternate training. Additionally, we introduce MANGO-Dialog, a high-quality dataset with over 50 hours of aligned 2D-3D conversational data across 500+ identities.

As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence of an adversary that deliberately introduces perturbations. Existing approaches typically model the interaction as a zero-sum game with continuous attacks. However, such designs overlook the inherent asymmetry between the agent and the adversary and then fail to reflect the sparsity of safety-critical risks, rendering the achieved robustness inadequate for practical AD scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce criticality-aware robust RL (CARRL), a novel adversarial training approach for handling sparse, safety-critical risks in autonomous driving. CARRL consists of two interacting components: a risk exposure adversary (REA) and a risk-targeted robust agent (RTRA). We model the interaction between the REA and RTRA as a general-sum game, allowing the REA to focus on exposing safety-critical failures (e.g., collisions) while the RTRA learns to balance safety with driving efficiency. The REA employs a decoupled optimization mechanism to better identify and exploit sparse safety-critical moments under a constrained budget. However, such focused attacks inevitably result in a scarcity of adversarial data. The RTRA copes with this scarcity by jointly leveraging benign and adversarial experiences via a dual replay buffer and enforces policy consistency under perturbations to stabilize behavior.

In collaboration with pathologists and guided by the the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Protocols, we design a Clinical Pathology Report Template (CPRT) that ensures comprehensive and standardized extraction of diagnostic elements from pathology reports. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline on TCGA-BRCA. First, we extract pathological features from reports using CPRT. These features are then used to build CTIS-Align, a dataset of 80k slide-description pairs from 804 WSIs for vision-language alignment training, and CTIS-Bench, a rigorously curated VQA benchmark comprising 977 WSIs and 14,879 question-answer pairs. CTIS-Bench emphasizes clinically grounded, closed-ended questions (e.g., tumor grade, receptor status) that reflect real diagnostic workflows, minimize non-visual reasoning, and require genuine slide understanding. We further propose CTIS-QA, a Slide-level Question Answering model, featuring a dual-stream architecture that mimics pathologists' diagnostic approach. One stream captures global slide-level context via clustering-based feature aggregation, while the other focuses on salient local regions through attention-guided patch perception module. Extensive experiments on WSI-VQA, CTIS-Bench, and slide-level diagnostic tasks show that CTIS-QA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics.

In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(\u03b8)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $\u03b8$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(\u03b8)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(\u03b8)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(\u03b8)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(\u03b8)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u9ad8\u9636\u77e9\uff08\u504f\u5ea6\u548c\u5cf0\u5ea6\uff09\u4fee\u6b63PPO\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u6781\u7aef\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fbe75%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e38\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u56e0\u7d20\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u56de\u62a5\u4f46\u884c\u4e3a\u8fe5\u5f02\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c0f\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6b65\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u4fdd\u6301\u7a84\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u8be5\u5206\u5e03\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u66f4\u65b0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u5efa\u6a21\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u56de\u62a5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u77e9\uff08\u504f\u5ea6\u548c\u5cf0\u5ea6\uff09\u6765\u504f\u7f6ePPO\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u6781\u7aef\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u963b\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u5165\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728Walker2D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u7a84\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe75%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u56de\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u503c\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u56de\u62a5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4f73\u65f6\uff0c\u6807\u51c6PPO\u96be\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u7a84\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u8be5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, most such methods rely on vast amounts of pretraining data. This work introduces Subimage Overlap Prediction, a novel self-supervised pretraining task to aid semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery that uses significantly lesser pretraining imagery. Given an image, a sub-image is extracted and the model is trained to produce a semantic mask of the location of the extracted sub-image within the original image. We demonstrate that pretraining with this task results in significantly faster convergence, and equal or better performance (measured via mIoU) on downstream segmentation. This gap in convergence and performance widens when labeled training data is reduced. We show this across multiple architecture types, and with multiple downstream datasets. We also show that our method matches or exceeds performance while requiring significantly lesser pretraining data relative to other SSL methods.

Despite rapid progress in scientific Machine Learning (ML) models, a critical bottleneck is the lack of expensive real-world data, resulting in most current models being trained and validated on simulated data. Beyond limiting the development and evaluation of scientific ML, this gap also hinders research into essential tasks such as sim-to-real transfer. We introduce RealPDEBench, the first benchmark for scientific ML that integrates real-world measurements with paired numerical simulations. RealPDEBench consists of five datasets, three tasks, eight metrics, and ten baselines. We first present five real-world measured datasets with paired simulated datasets across different complex physical systems. We further define three tasks, which allow comparisons between real-world and simulated data, and facilitate the development of methods to bridge the two. Moreover, we design eight evaluation metrics, spanning data-oriented and physics-oriented metrics, and finally benchmark ten representative baselines, including state-of-the-art models, pretrained PDE foundation models, and a traditional method. Experiments reveal significant discrepancies between simulated and real-world data, while showing that pretraining with simulated data consistently improves both accuracy and convergence. In this work, we hope to provide insights from real-world data, advancing scientific ML toward bridging the sim-to-real gap and real-world deployment.

However, backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to FL. These attacks aim to implant a stealthy trigger into the global model, causing it to mislead on inputs that possess a specific trigger while functioning normally on benign data. Although pre-aggregation detection is a main defense direction, existing state-of-the-art defenses often rely on fixed defense parameters. This reliance makes them vulnerable to single-point-of-failure risks, rendering them less effective against sophisticated attackers. To address these limitations, we propose FAROS, an enhanced FL framework that incorporates Adaptive Differential Scaling (ADS) and Robust Core-set Computing (RCC). The ADS mechanism adjusts the defense's sensitivity dynamically, based on the dispersion of uploaded gradients by clients in each round. This allows it to counter attackers who strategically shift between stealthiness and effectiveness.

Our model is uniquely trained using two complementary explanation styles: (1) concise explanations that summarize the key factors influencing its decision, and (2) comprehensive explanations detailing the specific differences observed between the images. We adapt and enhance a state-of-the-art modeling approach originally designed for audio-based differentiation to suit visual inputs effectively. This cross-modal transfer significantly improves our model's accuracy and interpretability. The proposed VLM integrates sophisticated feature extraction techniques with advanced reasoning capabilities, enabling clear articulation of its verification process.

Existing methods enhance model compatibility with data heterogeneity by splitting models and knowledge distillation. However, they neglect the insufficient communication bandwidth and computing power on the client, failing to strike an effective balance between addressing data heterogeneity and accommodating limited client resources. To tackle this limitation, we propose a personalized federated learning method based on cosine sparsification parameter packing and dual-weighted aggregation (FedCSPACK), which effectively leverages the limited client resources and reduces the impact of data heterogeneity on model performance. In FedCSPACK, the client packages model parameters and selects the most contributing parameter packages for sharing based on cosine similarity, effectively reducing bandwidth requirements. The client then generates a mask matrix anchored to the shared parameter package to improve the alignment and aggregation efficiency of sparse updates on the server. Furthermore, directional and distribution distance weights are embedded in the mask to implement a weighted-guided aggregation mechanism, enhancing the robustness and generalization performance of the global model. Extensive experiments across four datasets using ten state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that FedCSPACK effectively improves communication and computational efficiency while maintaining high model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedCSPACK\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u6253\u5305\u548c\u53cc\u6743\u91cd\u805a\u5408\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d44\u6e90\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedCSPACK\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6253\u5305\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5305\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e26\u5bbd\u9700\u6c42\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u5305\u751f\u6210\u63a9\u7801\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u805a\u5408\u6548\u7387\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u8ddd\u79bb\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u6743\u5f15\u5bfc\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u5341\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedCSPACK\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "FedCSPACK\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u6253\u5305\u548c\u53cc\u6743\u91cd\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861"}}

Many parameter-efficient Video-LLMs rely on unconstrained bidirectional projectors to model inter-frame interactions, which can blur temporal ordering by allowing later frames to influence earlier representations, without explicit architectural mechanisms to respect the directional nature of video reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose V-CORE, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces explicit temporal ordering constraints for video understanding. V-CORE consists of two key components: (1) Learnable Spatial Aggregation (LSA), which adaptively selects salient spatial tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) a Causality-Aware Temporal Projector (CATP), which enforces structured unidirectional information flow via block-causal attention and a terminal dynamic summary token acting as a causal sink. This design preserves intra-frame spatial interactions while ensuring that temporal information is aggregated in a strictly ordered manner. With 4-bit QLoRA and a frozen LLM backbone, V-CORE can be trained efficiently on a single consumer GPU.

Although multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a widely used method for evaluating epistasis, exhaustive MDR-based searches become computationally infeasible as the number of loci or the interaction order increases. In this paper, we define the epistasis detection problem as a black-box optimization problem and solve it with a factorization machine with quadratic optimization annealing (FMQA). We propose an efficient epistasis detection method based on FMQA, in which the classification error rate (CER) computed by MDR is used as a black-box objective function. Experimental evaluations were conducted using simulated case-control datasets with predefined high-order epistasis. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully identified ground-truth epistasis across various interaction orders and the numbers of genetic loci within a limited number of iterations.

Owing to its rapid spread characteristics, early and precise identification is crucial to prevent outbreaks and ensure timely intervention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based approach called LUMPNet for the early detection of LSD. LUMPNet utilizes image data to detect and classify skin nodules -- the primary indicator of LSD. To this end, LUMPNet uses YOLOv11, EfficientNet-based CNN classifier with compound scaling, and a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer. More precisely, LUMPNet detects and localizes LSD skin nodules and lesions on cattle images. It exploits EfficientNet to classify the localized cattle images into LSD-affected or healthy categories. To stabilize and accelerate the training of YOLOv11 and EfficientNet hybrid model, a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer is proposed and utilized. We evaluate LUMPNet at various stages of LSD using a publicly available dataset. Results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves 99% LSD detection training accuracy, and outperforms existing schemes. The model also achieves validation accuracy of 98%. Moreover, for further evaluation, we conduct a case study using an optimized EfficientNet-B0 model trained with the AdamW optimizer, and compare its performance with LUMPNet.

Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost.

However, it remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and ambiguity of dynamic egocentric scenes. Motivated by evidence that scene contextual information plays a crucial role in modulating human attention, in this paper, we present a language-guided scene context-aware learning framework for robust egocentric visual attention prediction. We first design a context perceiver which is guided to summarize the egocentric video based on a language-based scene description, generating context-aware video representations. We then introduce two training objectives that: 1) encourage the framework to focus on the target point-of-interest regions and 2) suppress distractions from irrelevant regions which are less likely to attract first-person attention.

In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.21 and an F1score of 95.62 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its valiance as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aRSwinV2\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eMpox\uff08\u7334\u75d8\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u6b8b\u5deeSwinTransformerV2\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728Kaggle\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523096.21%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c95.62% F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Mpox\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u533a\u5206Mpox\u3001\u6c34\u75d8\u3001\u9ebb\u75b9\u548c\u725b\u75d8\u7b49\u76f8\u4f3c\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684RSwinV2\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u5236\u5206\u5c42Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u79fb\u4f4d\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u9006\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\uff08IRB\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff1b4\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Kaggle\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRSwinV2\u8fbe\u523096.21%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c95.62% F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6CNN\u6a21\u578b\u548cSwinTransformer\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3aMpox\u75c5\u53d8\u89c2\u5bdf\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RSwinV2\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8054\u80fd\u529b\u548cIRB\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Mpox\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While some studies have addressed the generation of facial videos driven by emotional audio, efficiently generating high-quality talking head videos that integrate both emotional expressions and style features remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ESGaussianFace, an innovative framework for emotional and stylized audio-driven facial animation. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct 3D scenes and render videos, ensuring efficient generation of 3D consistent results. We propose an emotion-audio-guided spatial attention method that effectively integrates emotion features with audio content features. Through emotion-guided attention, the model is able to reconstruct facial details across different emotional states more accurately. To achieve emotional and stylized deformations of the 3D Gaussian points through emotion and style features, we introduce two 3D Gaussian deformation predictors. Futhermore, we propose a multi-stage training strategy, enabling the step-by-step learning of the character's lip movements, emotional variations, and style features. Our generated results exhibit high efficiency, high quality, and 3D consistency.

While most existing methods focus on improving within-category anomaly scoring, practical deployments increasingly require task-agnostic operation under continual category expansion, where the category identity is unknown at test time. In this setting, overall performance is often dominated by expert selection, namely routing an input to an appropriate normality model before any head-specific scoring is applied. However, routing rules that compare head-specific anomaly scores across independently constructed heads are unreliable in practice, as score distributions can differ substantially across categories in scale and tail behavior.\n  We propose GCR, a lightweight mixture-of-experts framework for stabilizing task-agnostic continual anomaly detection through geometry-consistent routing. GCR routes each test image directly in a shared frozen patch-embedding space by minimizing an accumulated nearest-prototype distance to category-specific prototype banks, and then computes anomaly maps only within the routed expert using a standard prototype-based scoring rule. By separating cross-head decision making from within-head anomaly scoring, GCR avoids cross-head score comparability issues without requiring end-to-end representation learning.\n  Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA show that geometry-consistent routing substantially improves routing stability and mitigates continual performance collapse, achieving near-zero forgetting while maintaining competitive detection and localization performance. These results indicate that many failures previously attributed to representation forgetting can instead be explained by decision-rule instability in cross-head routing.

By estimating parameters for a minimal set of virtual light sources, RRNet enables localized relighting through a depth-aware rendering module without requiring pixel-aligned training data. This object-aware formulation preserves facial identity and supports real-time, high-resolution performance using a streamlined encoder and lightweight prediction head. To facilitate training, we propose a generative AI-based dataset creation pipeline that synthesizes diverse lighting conditions at low cost. With its interpretable lighting control and efficient architecture, RRNet is well suited for practical applications such as video conferencing, AR-based portrait enhancement, and mobile photography.

As SMOTE is one of the most popular approaches to addressing this issue, it is imperative to validate it not only empirically but also theoretically. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of SMOTE's convergence properties. Concretely, we prove that the synthetic random variable Z converges in probability to the underlying random variable X. We further prove a stronger convergence in mean when X is compact.

To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion approach named Entity-Guided Multi-Task learning for infrared and visible image fusion (EGMT). Our approach includes three key innovative components: (i) A principled method is proposed to extract entity-level textual information from image captions generated by large vision-language models, eliminating semantic noise from raw text while preserving critical semantic information; (ii) A parallel multi-task learning architecture is constructed, which integrates image fusion with a multi-label classification task. By using entities as pseudo-labels, the multi-label classification task provides semantic supervision, enabling the model to achieve a deeper understanding of image content and significantly improving the quality and semantic density of the fused image; (iii) An entity-guided cross-modal interactive module is also developed to facilitate the fine-grained interaction between visual and entity-level textual features, which enhances feature representation by capturing cross-modal dependencies at both inter-visual and visual-entity levels. To promote the wide application of the entity-guided image fusion framework, we release the entity-annotated version of four public datasets (i.e., TNO, RoadScene, M3FD, and MSRS).

Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\\Rightarrow$internalization$\\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning.

SynRXN decomposes end-to-end synthesis planning into five task families, covering reaction rebalancing, atom-to-atom mapping, reaction classification, reaction property prediction, and synthesis route design. Curated, provenance-tracked reaction corpora are assembled from heterogeneous public sources into a harmonized representation and packaged as versioned datasets for each task family, with explicit source metadata, licence tags, and machine-readable manifests that record checksums, and row counts. For every task, SynRXN provides transparent splitting functions that generate leakage-aware train, validation, and test partitions, together with standardized evaluation workflows and metric suites tailored to classification, regression, and structured prediction settings. For sensitive benchmarking, we combine public training and validation data with held-out gold-standard test sets, and contamination-prone tasks such as reaction rebalancing and atom-to-atom mapping are distributed only as evaluation sets and are explicitly not intended for model training. Scripted build recipes enable bitwise-reproducible regeneration of all corpora across machines and over time, and the entire resource is released under permissive open licences to support reuse and extension. By removing dataset heterogeneity and packaging transparent, reusable evaluation scaffolding, SynRXN enables fair longitudinal comparison of CASP methods, supports rigorous ablations and stress tests along the full reaction-informatics pipeline, and lowers the barrier for practitioners who seek robust and comparable performance estimates for real-world synthesis planning workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynRXN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u65cf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u65cf\uff1a\u53cd\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5408\u6210\u8def\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u4ece\u5f02\u6784\u516c\u5171\u6e90\u6536\u96c6\u53cd\u5e94\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u5206\u5272\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u9632\u6cc4\u9732\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u811a\u672c\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7248\u672c\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3001\u9632\u6cc4\u9732\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "SynRXN\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301CASP\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u7eb5\u5411\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u83b7\u53d6\u7a33\u5065\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access. Empirically, RePro consistently attains strong performance and transfers well across refiners, suggesting that it exploits refiner-agnostic distribution shifts rather than rewrite-style artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRefinement Provenance Inference (RPI)\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1RePro\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u5236token\u5206\u5e03\u548clogit\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a8\u65ad\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5426\u7ecf\u8fc7LLM\u6539\u5199\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56LLM\u6539\u5199\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5ba1\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u793a-\u54cd\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u80fd\u5426\u63a8\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u63d0\u793a\u8fd8\u662f\u5176LLM\u6539\u5199\u7248\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\uff1f\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e89\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRePro\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u6539\u5199\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u5236token\u5206\u5e03\u7a33\u5b9a\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u5236\u4f3c\u7136\u7279\u5f81\u548clogit\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u5b50\u5fae\u8c03\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u6027\u5934\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u63a8\u65ad\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "result": "RePro\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u8de8\u6539\u5199\u5668\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u6539\u5199\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u800c\u975e\u6539\u5199\u98ce\u683c\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u6539\u5199\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684token\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0cRePro\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3RPI\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e89\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SerpentFlow\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u914d\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u57df\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u57df\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u5e95\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6210\u5206\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "SerpentFlow\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u8de8\u57df\u5171\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u548c\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u66ff\u6362\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f4e\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u83b7\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u5219\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u5206\u79bb\u9891\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u4f4e\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u89e3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "SerpentFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u4f2a\u914d\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\u540c\u65f6\u6ce8\u5165\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

While ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for detecting thyroid nodules, its diagnostic accuracy is often limited by challenges such as low image contrast and blurred nodule boundaries. To address these issues, we propose Nodule-DETR, a novel detection transformer (DETR) architecture designed for robust thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound images. Nodule-DETR introduces three key innovations: a Multi-Spectral Frequency-domain Channel Attention (MSFCA) module that leverages frequency analysis to enhance features of low-contrast nodules; a Hierarchical Feature Fusion (HFF) module for efficient multi-scale integration; and Multi-Scale Deformable Attention (MSDA) to flexibly capture small and irregularly shaped nodules. We conducted extensive experiments on a clinical dataset of real-world thyroid ultrasound images. The results demonstrate that Nodule-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by a significant margin of 0.149 in mAP@0.5:0.95. The superior accuracy of Nodule-DETR highlights its significant potential for clinical application as an effective tool in computer-aided thyroid diagnosis.

While recent advances leverage iterative refinement-based strategies, they fail to explicitly utilize the hierarchical nature of human actions. In this work, we propose HybridTAS - a novel framework that incorporates a hybrid of Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries into the denoising process of diffusion models to exploit the hierarchical structure of actions. Hyperbolic geometry naturally provides tree-like relationships between embeddings, enabling us to guide the action label denoising process in a coarse-to-fine manner: higher diffusion timesteps are influenced by abstract, high-level action categories (root nodes), while lower timesteps are refined using fine-grained action classes (leaf nodes). Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GTEA, 50Salads, and Breakfast, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of hyperbolic-guided denoising for the temporal action segmentation task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHybridTAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHybridTAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u6df7\u5408\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6811\u72b6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1a\u9ad8\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u53d7\u62bd\u8c61\u9ad8\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u6839\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f4e\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5219\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u7c7b\uff08\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316", "result": "\u5728GTEA\u300150Salads\u548cBreakfast\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53cc\u66f2\u5f15\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "HybridTAS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u4f5c\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

A specific instability that often occurs for large learning rates at the end of training is output logit divergence. The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called \u03bc-centering, or a regularization method called \u03bc-loss.

The use of group-level rewards successfully aligns the model with the targeted reward. However, it faces challenges including low efficiency, dependency on stochastic samplers, and reward hacking. The problem is that rectified flow models are fundamentally different from LLMs: 1) For efficiency, online image sampling takes much more time and dominates the time of training. 2) For stochasticity, rectified flow is deterministic once the initial noise is fixed. Aiming at these problems and inspired by the effects of group-level rewards from LLMs, we design Group-level Direct Reward Optimization (GDRO). GDRO is a new post-training paradigm for group-level reward alignment that combines the characteristics of rectified flow models. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we point out that GDRO supports full offline training that saves the large time cost for image rollout sampling. Also, it is diffusion-sampler-independent, which eliminates the need for the ODE-to-SDE approximation to obtain stochasticity. We also empirically study the reward hacking trap that may mislead the evaluation, and involve this factor in the evaluation using a corrected score that not only considers the original evaluation reward but also the trend of reward hacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDRO effectively and efficiently improves the reward score of the diffusion model through group-wise offline optimization across the OCR and GenEval tasks, while demonstrating strong stability and robustness in mitigating reward hacking.", "AI": {"tldr": "GDRO\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u76f4\u63a5\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebfRL\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4eceLLMs\u5230\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eLLMs\u6709\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u6837\u8017\u65f6\uff1b2\uff09\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\uff08\u4e00\u65e6\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u56fa\u5b9a\uff09", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u76f4\u63a5\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\uff08GDRO\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u5b8c\u5168\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700ODE-to-SDE\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u8003\u8651\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6821\u6b63\u5206\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "\u5728OCR\u548cGenEval\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGDRO\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "GDRO\u4e3a\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}

Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture.

To address these, we propose DMPEAD, a Dynamic Model Pool and Ensembling framework for MTS Anomaly Detection. The framework first (i) constructs a diverse model pool via parameter transfer and diversity metric, then (ii) updates it with a meta-model and similarity-based strategy for adaptive pool expansion, subset selection, and pool merging, finally (iii) ensembles top-ranked models through proxy metric ranking and top-k aggregation in the selected subset, outputting the final anomaly detection result.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework with adaptive memory allocation and global noise filtering called MacVQA for visual question answering. MacVQA fuses visual and question information while filtering noise to ensure robust representations, and employs prototype-based memory allocation to optimize feature quality and memory usage. These designs enable MacVQA to balance knowledge acquisition, retention, and compositional generalization in continual VQA learning. Experiments on ten continual VQA tasks show that MacVQA outperforms existing baselines, achieving 43.38% average accuracy and 2.32% average forgetting on standard tasks, and 42.53% average accuracy and 3.60% average forgetting on novel composition tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MacVQA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u9886\u57df\u9762\u4e34\u5e73\u8861\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMacVQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5206\u914d\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u6301\u7eedVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMacVQA\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6807\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u738743.38%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9057\u5fd8\u73872.32%\uff1b\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u738742.53%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9057\u5fd8\u73873.60%\u3002", "conclusion": "MacVQA\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6301\u7eedVQA\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/liuxingguo9349/pptv-enso-env", "summary": "The El Ni{~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exerts profound influence on global climate variability, yet its prediction remains a grand challenge. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved forecasting skill, but the opacity of these models hampers scientific trust and operational deployment. Here, we introduce a mathematically grounded interpretability framework based on bounded variation function. By rescuing the \"dead\" neurons from the saturation zone of the activation function, we enhance the model's expressive capacity. Our analysis reveals that ENSO predictability emerges dominantly from the tropical Pacific, with contributions from the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, consistent with physical understanding. Controlled experiments affirm the robustness of our method and its alignment with established predictors. Notably, we probe the persistent Spring Predictability Barrier (SPB), finding that despite expanded sensitivity during spring, predictive performance declines-likely due to suboptimal variable selection. These results suggest that incorporating additional ocean-atmosphere variables may help transcend SPB limitations and advance long-range ENSO prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u754c\u53d8\u5dee\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u9971\u548c\u533a\"\u62ef\u6551\"\u6b7b\u4ea1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ENSO\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u70ed\u5e26\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6625\u5b63\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u969c\u788d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86ENSO\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u754c\u53d8\u5dee\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u9971\u548c\u533a\"\u62ef\u6551\"\u6b7b\u4ea1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790ENSO\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aENSO\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u70ed\u5e26\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\uff0c\u5370\u5ea6\u6d0b\u548c\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u4e5f\u6709\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6625\u5b63\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u969c\u788d\u671f\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60ENSO\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6625\u5b63\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u969c\u788d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u7eb3\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u6d77\u6c14\u53d8\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7a81\u7834SPB\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u957f\u671fENSO\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

This paper concentrates on relieving this requirement via developing a coarse-to-fine normal estimator. Concretely, our method first trains a neat model from a small dataset to produce coarse face normals that perform as guidance (called exemplars) for the following refinement. A self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, thus remedying severe local artifacts left in estimated coarse facial normals. Then, a refinement network is customized for the sake of mapping input face images together with corresponding exemplars to fine-grained high-quality facial normals. Such a logical function split can significantly cut the requirement of massive paired data and computational resource. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our design and reveal its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both training expense as well as estimation quality.

In this work, we identify a critical spectral degradation phenomenon inherent to these constraints, termed the Homogeneity Trap. We demonstrate that the maximum-entropy bias, typical of Sinkhorn-based projections, drives the mixing operator towards the uniform barycenter, thereby suppressing the subdominant singular value \u03c3_2 and filtering out high-frequency feature components. We derive a spectral bound linking \u03c3_2 to the network's effective depth, showing that high-entropy constraints restrict feature transformation to a shallow effective receptive field. Furthermore, we formally demonstrate that Layer Normalization fails to mitigate this collapse in noise-dominated regimes; specifically, when spectral filtering degrades the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) below a critical threshold, geometric structure is irreversibly lost to noise-induced orthogonal collapse.

However, transferring complex motions between videos remains challenging. In this work, we present MotionAdapter, a content-aware motion transfer framework that enables robust and semantically aligned motion transfer within DiT-based T2V models. Our key insight is that effective motion transfer requires \\romannumeral1) explicit disentanglement of motion from appearance and \\romannumeral 2) adaptive customization of motion to target content. MotionAdapter first isolates motion by analyzing cross-frame attention within 3D full-attention modules to extract attention-derived motion fields. To bridge the semantic gap between reference and target videos, we further introduce a DINO-guided motion customization module that rearranges and refines motion fields based on content correspondences.

The traditional data subsampling method works as a static, task independent preprocessing step which usually discards information that is critical to downstream prediction. In this paper, we introduces the antagonistic soft selection subsampling (ASSS) framework as is a novel paradigm that reconstructs data reduction into a differentiable end-to-end learning problem. ASSS uses the adversarial game between selector network and task network, and selector network learning assigns continuous importance weights to samples. This direct optimization implemented by Gumbel-Softmax relaxation allows the selector to identify and retain samples with the maximum amount of information for a specific task target under the guidance of the loss function that balances the fidelity and sparsity of the prediction. Theoretical analysis links this framework with the information bottleneck principle. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale real world datasets show that ASSS has always been better than heuristic subsampling baselines such as clustering and nearest neighbor thinning in maintaining model performance. It is worth noting that ASSS can not only match, but also sometimes exceed the training performance of the entire dataset, showcasing the effect of intelligent denoising.

However, due to language bias, LVLMs are susceptible to object hallucination, which can be primarily divided into category, attribute, and relation hallucination, significantly impeding the trustworthy AI applications. Editing the internal activations of LVLMs has shown promising effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations with minimal cost. However, previous editing approaches neglect the effective guidance offered by factual textual semantics, thereby struggling to explicitly mitigate language bias. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Factual-guided Visual-Textual Editing for hallucination mitigation (AFTER), which comprises Factual-Augmented Activation Steering (FAS) and Query-Adaptive Offset Optimization (QAO), to adaptively guides the original biased activations towards factual semantics. Specifically, FAS is proposed to provide factual and general guidance for activation editing, thereby explicitly modeling the precise visual-textual associations. Subsequently, QAO introduces a query-aware offset estimator to establish query-specific editing from the general steering vector, enhancing the diversity and granularity of editing. Extensive experiments on standard hallucination benchmarks across three widely adopted LVLMs validate the efficacy of the proposed AFTER, notably achieving up to a 16.3% reduction of hallucination over baseline on the AMBER benchmark.

To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other.

However, existing CDMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when continuously learning new concepts. Most prior works attempt to mitigate this issue under the sequential learning setting with a fixed order of concept inflow and neglect inter-concept interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework - Forget Less by Learning Together (FL2T) - that enables concurrent and order-agnostic concept learning while addressing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce a set-invariant inter-concept learning module where proxies guide feature selection across concepts, facilitating improved knowledge retention and transfer. By leveraging inter-concept guidance, our approach preserves old concepts while efficiently incorporating new ones. Extensive experiments, across three datasets, demonstrates that our method significantly improves concept retention and mitigates catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the effectiveness of inter-concept catalytic behavior in incremental concept learning of ten tasks with at least 2% gain on average CLIP Image Alignment scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFL2T\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9a\u5236\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u53d1\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u5236\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u987a\u5e8f\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFL2T\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u96c6\u5408\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u8de8\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u6307\u5bfc\u4fdd\u7559\u65e7\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747CLIP\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u53472%", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u50ac\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0cFL2T\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u53d1\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898"}}

Under review", "summary": "Spatial reasoning -- the ability to perceive and reason about relationships in space -- advances vision-language models (VLMs) from visual perception toward spatial semantic understanding. Existing approaches either revisit local image patches, improving fine-grained perception but weakening global spatial awareness, or mark isolated coordinates, which capture object locations but overlook their overall organization. In this work, we integrate the cognitive concept of an object-centric blueprint into VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Given an image and a question, the model first constructs a JSON-style blueprint that records the positions, sizes, and attributes of relevant objects, and then reasons over this structured representation to produce the final answer. To achieve this, we introduce three key techniques: (1) blueprint-embedded reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning to elicit basic reasoning skills; (2) blueprint-aware rewards in reinforcement learning to encourage the blueprint to include an appropriate number of objects and to align final answers with this causal reasoning; and (3) anti-shortcut data augmentation that applies targeted perturbations to images and questions, discouraging reliance on superficial visual or linguistic cues. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing VLMs and specialized spatial reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u84dd\u56fe\u8ba4\u77e5\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316JSON\u84dd\u56fe\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff08\u524a\u5f31\u5168\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6807\u8bb0\u5b64\u7acb\u5750\u6807\uff08\u5ffd\u7565\u7269\u4f53\u6574\u4f53\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u84dd\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u84dd\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2\uff09\u84dd\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u84dd\u56fe\u5305\u542b\u9002\u5f53\u6570\u91cf\u7269\u4f53\u5e76\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b3\uff09\u6297\u6377\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u84dd\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u84dd\u56fe\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u63a8\u8fdb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional predictive methods often struggle to balance prediction accuracy with computational efficiency when capturing complex spatial conformations. To address this challenge, we propose an Edge-aware Graph Attention Network (Edge-aware GAT) model for the fine-grained prediction of binding sites across various biomolecules, including proteins, DNA/RNA, ions, ligands, and lipids. Our method constructs atom-level graphs and integrates multidimensional structural features, including geometric descriptors, DSSP-derived secondary structure, and relative solvent accessibility (RSA), to generate spatially aware embedding vectors. By incorporating interatomic distances and directional vectors as edge features within the attention mechanism, the model significantly enhances its representation capacity. On benchmark datasets, our model achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.93 for protein-protein binding site prediction, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The use of directional tensor propagation and residue-level attention pooling further improves both binding site localization and the capture of local structural details. Visualizations using PyMOL confirm the model's practical utility and interpretability. To facilitate community access and application, we have deployed a publicly accessible web server at http://119.45.201.89:5000/.

Existing learning-based methods often suffer from significant performance degradation when applied to complex real-world hazy scenes, primarily due to limited training data and the intrinsic complexity of haze density distributions.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Adaptive Patch Importance-aware (API) framework for generalizable real-world image dehazing. Specifically, our framework consists of an Automatic Haze Generation (AHG) module and a Density-aware Haze Removal (DHR) module. AHG provides a hybrid data augmentation strategy by generating realistic and diverse hazy images as additional high-quality training data. DHR considers hazy regions with varying haze density distributions for generalizable real-world image dehazing in an adaptive patch importance-aware manner. To alleviate the ambiguity of the dehazed image details, we further introduce a new Multi-Negative Contrastive Dehazing (MNCD) loss, which fully utilizes information from multiple negative samples across both spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world benchmarks, delivering strong results in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual quality, and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse haze distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAPI\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u96fe\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u52a8\u96fe\u973e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u96fe\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u96fe\u973e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u96fe\u973e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5185\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u96fe\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5757\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5(API)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u81ea\u52a8\u96fe\u973e\u751f\u6210(AHG)\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6837\u7684\u96fe\u973e\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2)\u5bc6\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u96fe(DHR)\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5757\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u96fe\u973e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\uff1b3)\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u53bb\u96fe(MNCD)\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u57df\u7684\u591a\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u96fe\u973e\u5206\u5e03\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "API\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bc6\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u96fe\u548c\u591a\u57df\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u96fe\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u96fe\u973e\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as \"Confident Conflicts\" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEntropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7ea7\u71b5\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u533a\u5206\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u5728\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u800c\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1aRL\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800cSFT\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u81ea\u4fe1\u51b2\u7a81\"token\uff08\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u4f46\u4f4e\u71b5\uff09\u5f15\u53d1\u7834\u574f\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u71b5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5fae\u8c03(EAFT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cEAFT\u5229\u7528token\u7ea7\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6765\u533a\u5206\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u51b2\u7a81\u6570\u636e\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen\u548cGLM\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff084B\u523032B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002EAFT\u5728\u5339\u914d\u6807\u51c6SFT\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "EAFT\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SFT\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing methods mainly address a single type of degradation (e.g., haze or low-light) at a time, ignoring the interplay of different degradation types and resulting in limited visibility improvement. We observe that the domain knowledge shared between low-light and haze priors can be reinforced mutually for better visibility. Based on this key insight, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances visibility in nighttime hazy images by reinforcing the intrinsic consistency between haze and low-light priors mutually and progressively. In particular, our model utilizes image-, patch-, and pixel-level experts that operate across visual and frequency domains to recover global scene structure, regional patterns, and fine-grained details progressively. A frequency-aware router is further introduced to adaptively guide the contribution of each expert, ensuring robust image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model on nighttime dehazing benchmarks both quantitatively and qualitatively.

In this model, an adversary, upon looking at a \"clean\" i.i.d. dataset, inserts additional \"corrupted\" points of their choice into the dataset. These added points are constrained to be monotone corruptions, in that they get labeled according to the ground-truth target function. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that in this setting, all known optimal learning algorithms for binary classification can be made to achieve suboptimal expected error on a new independent test point drawn from the same distribution as the clean dataset. On the other hand, we show that uniform convergence-based algorithms do not degrade in their guarantees.

However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5212\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728CAGE-4\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u63a2\u7d22\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5bfc\u5411\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u52a8\u4f5c\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728CAGE-4\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5bf9\u624b\u884c\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u5bfc\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9632\u5fa1\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u524d\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, their performance drops significantly on severely degraded, low-quality images, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose GleSAM++, which utilizes Generative Latent space Enhancement to boost robustness on low-quality images, thus enabling generalization across various image qualities. Additionally, to improve compatibility between the pre-trained diffusion model and the segmentation framework, we introduce two techniques, i.e., Feature Distribution Alignment (FDA) and Channel Replication and Expansion (CRE). However, the above components lack explicit guidance regarding the degree of degradation. The model is forced to implicitly fit a complex noise distribution that spans conditions from mild noise to severe artifacts, which substantially increases the learning burden and leads to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this issue, we further introduce a Degradation-aware Adaptive Enhancement (DAE) mechanism. The key principle of DAE is to decouple the reconstruction process for arbitrary-quality features into two stages: degradation-level prediction and degradation-aware reconstruction.

However, mainstream training paradigms face key challenges: Behavior Cloning is simple and effective through imitation but suffers from low behavioral diversity, while Reinforcement Learning is capable of discovering novel strategies through exploration but heavily relies on manually designed reward functions. To address the conflict between these two methods, we present CORE, a Code-based Inverse Self-Training Framework with Graph Expansion that bridges imitation and exploration, offering a novel training framework that promotes behavioral diversity while eliminating the reliance on manually reward design. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Code Abstraction to automatically infers reward functions from expert demonstrations without manual design. The inferred reward function, referred to as the Label Function, is executable code that verifies one key step within a task. Building on this, we propose Strategy Graph Expansion to enhance in-domain behavioral diversity, which constructs a multi-path graph called Strategy Graph that captures diverse valid solutions beyond expert demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Extrapolation, which enriches out-of-domain behavioral diversity by utilizing both successful and failed trajectories to expand the task space.

Currently, depth foundation models, such as Depth Anything, achieve great success in ideal scenes but remain challenging under adverse imaging conditions such as extreme illumination and motion blur. These degradations corrupt the visual signals of frame cameras, weakening the discriminative features of frame-based depths across the spatial and temporal dimensions. Typically, existing approaches incorporate event cameras to leverage their high dynamic range and temporal resolution, aiming to compensate for corrupted frame features. However, such specialized fusion models are predominantly trained from scratch on domain-specific datasets, thereby failing to inherit the open-world knowledge and robust generalization inherent to foundation models. In this work, we propose ADAE, an event-guided spatiotemporal fusion framework for Depth Anything in degraded scenes. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1) Entropy-Aware Spatial Fusion. We adaptively merge frame-based and event-based features using an information entropy strategy to indicate illumination-induced degradation. 2) Motion-Guided Temporal Correction. We resort to the event-based motion cue to recalibrate ambiguous features in blurred regions. Under our unified framework, the two components are complementary to each other and jointly enhance Depth Anything under adverse imaging conditions.

This paper addresses the problem by compressing and accelerating an SO(3)-equivariant GNN using low-bit quantization techniques. Specifically, we introduce three innovations for quantized equivariant transformers: (1) a magnitude-direction decoupled quantization scheme that separately quantizes the norm and orientation of equivariant (vector) features, (2) a branch-separated quantization-aware training strategy that treats invariant and equivariant feature channels differently in an attention-based $SO(3)$-GNN, and (3) a robustness-enhancing attention normalization mechanism that stabilizes low-precision attention computations. Experiments on the QM9 and rMD17 molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our 8-bit models achieve accuracy on energy and force predictions comparable to full-precision baselines with markedly improved efficiency. We also conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component to maintain accuracy and equivariance under quantization, using the Local error of equivariance (LEE) metric.

Existing approaches are fundamentally limited: replay-based methods are impractical and privacy-violating, while strict orthogonality-based methods collapse under scale: each new task is projected onto an orthogonal complement, progressively reducing the residual degrees of freedom and eliminating forward transfer by forbidding overlap in shared representations. In this work, we introduce ELLA, a training framework built on the principle of selective subspace de-correlation. Rather than forbidding all overlap, ELLA explicitly characterizes the structure of past updates and penalizes alignments along their high-energy, task-specific directions, while preserving freedom in the low-energy residual subspaces to enable transfer. Formally, this is realized via a lightweight regularizer on a single aggregated update matrix. We prove this mechanism corresponds to an anisotropic shrinkage operator that bounds interference, yielding a penalty that is both memory- and compute-constant regardless of task sequence length. ELLA requires no data replay, no architectural expansion, and negligible storage. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art CL performance on three popular benchmarks, with relative accuracy gains of up to $9.6\\%$ and a $35\\times$ smaller memory footprint. Further, ELLA scales robustly across architectures and actively enhances the model's zero-shot generalization performance on unseen tasks, establishing a principled and scalable solution for constructive lifelong LLM adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ELLA\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u4e14\u4fb5\u72af\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u4f1a\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u88ab\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6b63\u4ea4\u8865\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5c11\u5269\u4f59\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u524d\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "ELLA\u91c7\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u8fc7\u53bb\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u6cbf\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u805a\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6536\u7f29\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9650\u5236\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe9.6%\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u51cf\u5c1135\u500d\u3002\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3b\u52a8\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ELLA\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u6027\u7ec8\u8eabLLM\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Existing methods often rely on lightweight modules for fast feature extraction, which struggles to preserve structured patterns and fine-grained details, leading to texture attenuation during generation.To address these issues, we propose AlignVTOFF, a novel parallel U-Net framework built upon a Reference U-Net and Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment (TSFA). The Reference U-Net performs multi-scale feature extraction and enhances geometric fidelity, enabling robust modeling of deformation while retaining complex structured patterns. TSFA then injects the reference garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net via a hybrid attention design, consisting of a trainable cross-attention module and a frozen self-attention module. This design explicitly aligns texture and spatial cues and alleviates the loss of high-frequency information during the denoising process.Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate that AlignVTOFF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing flat-lay garment results with improved structural realism and high-frequency detail fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAlignVTOFF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884cU-Net\u548c\u7eb9\u7406-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u94fa\u670d\u88c5\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f(VTOFF)\u4efb\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u9ad8\u9891\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u6848\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7eb9\u7406\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAlignVTOFF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53c2\u8003U-Net\u548c\u7eb9\u7406-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50(TSFA)\u3002\u53c2\u8003U-Net\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1bTSFA\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u5c06\u53c2\u8003\u670d\u88c5\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u53bb\u566aU-Net\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAlignVTOFF\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e73\u94fa\u670d\u88c5\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "AlignVTOFF\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884cU-Net\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7eb9\u7406-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

These specialized accelerators are not only prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive but also suffer from significant supply scarcity, limiting the ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment on edge devices. The core of this inefficiency stems from the standard artificial perceptron's dependence on intensive matrix multiplications. However, biological nervous systems achieve unparalleled efficiency without such arithmetic intensity; synaptic signal transmission is regulated by physical ion channel limits and chemical neurotransmitter levels rather than a process that can be analogous to arithmetic multiplication. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose Neuro-Channel Networks (NCN), a novel multiplication-free architecture designed to decouple AI from expensive hardware dependencies. In our model, weights are replaced with Channel Widths that physically limit the signal magnitude, while a secondary parameter acts as a Neurotransmitter to regulate Signal Transmission based on sign logic. The forward pass relies exclusively on addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations (minimum, sign), eliminating floating-point multiplication entirely. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that NCNs can solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR and the Majority function with 100% accuracy using standard backpropagation, proving their capability to form complex decision boundaries without multiplicative weights. This architecture offers a highly efficient alternative for next-generation neuromorphic hardware, paving the way for running complex models on commodity CPUs or ultra-low-power chips without relying on costly GPU clusters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNeuro-Channel Networks (NCN)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4e58\u6cd5\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u901a\u9053\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u9012\u8d28\u53c2\u6570\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6cd5\u3001\u51cf\u6cd5\u548c\u4f4d\u8fd0\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9GPU\u7b49\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u5927\u3001\u4f9b\u5e94\u77ed\u7f3a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86AI\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u79bb\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u795e\u7ecf\u9012\u8d28\u8c03\u8282\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7b97\u672f\u4e58\u6cd5\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeuro-Channel Networks (NCN)\uff1a1) \u7528\u901a\u9053\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7269\u7406\u9650\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e45\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u9012\u8d28\u53c2\u6570\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u8c03\u8282\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b3) \u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6cd5\u3001\u51cf\u6cd5\u548c\u4f4d\u8fd0\u7b97\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\uff09\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u6d6e\u70b9\u4e58\u6cd5\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cNCN\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5100%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982XOR\u548c\u591a\u6570\u51fd\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u65e0\u9700\u4e58\u6cd5\u6743\u91cd\u5373\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "NCN\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u786c\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5546\u7528CPU\u6216\u8d85\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u82af\u7247\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8AI\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u3002"}}

To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. This design integrates perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified, self-corrective decision process. To enable fine-grained supervision and quantitative evaluation, we further construct GenBlemish-27K, a dataset of 6K T2I images with 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories.

We introduce POSEIDON (Physics-Optimized Seismic Energy Inference and Detection Operating Network), a physics-informed energy-based model for unified multi-task seismic event prediction, alongside the Poseidon dataset -- the largest open-source global earthquake catalog comprising 2.8 million events spanning 30 years. POSEIDON embeds fundamental seismological principles, including the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency relationship and Omori-Utsu aftershock decay law, as learnable constraints within an energy-based modeling framework. The architecture simultaneously addresses three interconnected prediction tasks: aftershock sequence identification, tsunami generation potential, and foreshock detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POSEIDON achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, outperforming gradient boosting, random forest, and CNN baselines with the highest average F1 score among all compared methods. Crucially, the learned physics parameters converge to scientifically interpretable values -- Gutenberg-Richter b-value of 0.752 and Omori-Utsu parameters p=0.835, c=0.1948 days -- falling within established seismological ranges while enhancing rather than compromising predictive accuracy.

Accurate simulation of postoperative facial morphology is essential for preoperative planning. However, traditional biomechanical models are computationally expensive, while geometric deep learning approaches often lack interpretability. In this study, we develop and validate a physics-informed geometric deep learning framework named PhysSFI-Net for precise prediction of soft tissue deformation following orthognathic surgery. PhysSFI-Net consists of three components: a hierarchical graph module with craniofacial and surgical plan encoders combined with attention mechanisms to extract skeletal-facial interaction features; a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based sequential predictor for incremental soft tissue deformation; and a biomechanics-inspired module for high-resolution facial surface reconstruction. Model performance was assessed using point cloud shape error (Hausdorff distance), surface deviation error, and landmark localization error (Euclidean distances of craniomaxillofacial landmarks) between predicted facial shapes and corresponding ground truths. A total of 135 patients who underwent combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment were included for model training and validation. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that PhysSFI-Net achieved a point cloud shape error of 1.070 +/- 0.088 mm, a surface deviation error of 1.296 +/- 0.349 mm, and a landmark localization error of 2.445 +/- 1.326 mm. Comparative experiments indicated that PhysSFI-Net outperformed the state-of-the-art method ACMT-Net in prediction accuracy. In conclusion, PhysSFI-Net enables interpretable, high-resolution prediction of postoperative facial morphology with superior accuracy, showing strong potential for clinical application in orthognathic surgical planning and simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "PhysSFI-Net\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u988c\u624b\u672f\u540e\u7684\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b63\u988c\u624b\u672f\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u672f\u540e\u9762\u90e8\u5f62\u6001\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u672f\u524d\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "PhysSFI-Net\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u5177\u6709\u9885\u9762\u548c\u624b\u672f\u8ba1\u5212\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u9aa8\u9abc-\u9762\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eLSTM\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u91cf\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d8\u5f62\uff1b3\uff09\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728135\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPhysSFI-Net\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u70b9\u4e91\u5f62\u72b6\u8bef\u5dee1.070\u00b10.088mm\u3001\u8868\u9762\u504f\u5dee\u8bef\u5dee1.296\u00b10.349mm\u3001\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee2.445\u00b11.326mm\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5ACMT-Net\u3002", "conclusion": "PhysSFI-Net\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u672f\u540e\u9762\u90e8\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u6b63\u988c\u624b\u672f\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with R\u00e9nyi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. With lower noise levels, our model maintains high accuracy while offering strong privacy guarantees, effectively balancing privacy and utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNVDP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5411transformer\u5d4c\u5165\u6dfb\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027", "motivation": "transformer\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5206\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1(NVDP)\uff0c\u5728transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210NVIB\u5c42\uff0c\u5411\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528R\u00e9nyi\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u8861\u91cf\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4", "result": "\u5728GLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1", "conclusion": "NVDP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

This manuscript is under review at IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "summary": "Glacial segmentation is essential for reconstructing past glacier dynamics and evaluating climate-driven landscape change. However, weak optical contrast and the limited availability of high-resolution DEMs hinder automated mapping. This study introduces the first large-scale optical-only moraine segmentation dataset, comprising 3,340 manually annotated high-resolution images from Google Earth covering glaciated regions of Sichuan and Yunnan, China. We develop MCD-Net, a lightweight baseline that integrates a MobileNetV2 encoder, a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and a DeepLabV3+ decoder.

Alpha decay represents a significant challenge, with traditional models such as DeepLOB losing predictive power as the time horizon (k) increases. In this paper, using data from the FI-2010 dataset, we introduce Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (T-KAN) to replace the fixed, linear weights of standard LSTMs with learnable B-spline activation functions. This allows the model to learn the 'shape' of market signals as opposed to just their magnitude. This resulted in a 19.1% relative improvement in the F1-score at the k = 100 horizon. The efficacy of T-KAN networks cannot be understated, producing a 132.48% return compared to the -82.76% DeepLOB drawdown under 1.0 bps transaction costs. In addition to this, the T-KAN model proves quite interpretable, with the 'dead-zones' being clearly visible in the splines. The T-KAN architecture is also uniquely optimized for low-latency FPGA implementation via High level Synthesis (HLS).

Cadambe", "Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali"], "title": "Game of Coding: Coding Theory in the Presence of Rational Adversaries, Motivated by Decentralized Machine Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Coding theory plays a crucial role in enabling reliable communication, storage, and computation. Classical approaches assume a worst-case adversarial model and ensure error correction and data recovery only when the number of honest nodes exceeds the number of adversarial ones by some margin. However, in some emerging decentralized applications, particularly in decentralized machine learning (DeML), participating nodes are rewarded for accepted contributions. This incentive structure naturally gives rise to rational adversaries who act strategically rather than behaving in purely malicious ways.\n  In this paper, we first motivate the need for coding in the presence of rational adversaries, particularly in the context of outsourced computation in decentralized systems. We contrast this need with existing approaches and highlight their limitations. We then introduce the game of coding, a novel game-theoretic framework that extends coding theory to trust-minimized settings where honest nodes are not in the majority. Focusing on repetition coding, we highlight two key features of this framework: (1) the ability to achieve a non-zero probability of data recovery even when adversarial nodes are in the majority, and (2) Sybil resistance, i.e., the equilibrium remains unchanged even as the number of adversarial nodes increases. Finally, we explore scenarios in which the adversary's strategy is unknown and outline several open problems for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\"\u7f16\u7801\u6e38\u620f\"\uff0c\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7406\u6027\u5bf9\u624b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u624b\u8282\u70b9\u5360\u591a\u6570\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u96f6\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709Sybil\u62b5\u6297\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6076\u610f\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u8bda\u5b9e\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc7\u5bf9\u624b\u8282\u70b9\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b0\u5174\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u56e0\u8d21\u732e\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u50ac\u751f\u4e86\u7406\u6027\u5bf9\u624b\uff08\u6218\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u975e\u7eaf\u7cb9\u6076\u610f\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u7406\u6027\u5bf9\u624b\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u7f16\u7801\u6e38\u620f\"\u8fd9\u4e00\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4fe1\u4efb\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u91cd\u590d\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u8282\u70b9\u5360\u591a\u6570\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709Sybil\u62b5\u6297\u6027\uff08\u5747\u8861\u4e0d\u968f\u5bf9\u624b\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6539\u53d8\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\uff1a1\uff09\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u624b\u8282\u70b9\u5360\u591a\u6570\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u96f6\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\uff1b2\uff09\u5177\u6709Sybil\u62b5\u6297\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u5747\u8861\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u968f\u5bf9\u624b\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u5305\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u7406\u6027\u5bf9\u624b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u5360\u591a\u6570\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e14\u5177\u6709Sybil\u62b5\u6297\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Traditional multi-view stereo struggles with sparse viewpoints or low-texture regions, while neural rendering approaches, though capable of producing high-quality results, require per-scene optimization and lack real-time efficiency. Explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient rendering, but most feed-forward variants focus on visual quality rather than geometric consistency, limiting accurate surface reconstruction and overall reliability in spatial perception tasks. This paper presents a novel feed-forward 3DGS framework for 360 images, capable of generating geometrically consistent Gaussian primitives while maintaining high rendering quality. A Depth-Normal geometric regularization is introduced to couple rendered depth gradients with normal information, supervising Gaussian rotation, scale, and position to improve point cloud and surface accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains high rendering quality while significantly improving geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for 3D reconstruction in spatial perception tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e360\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7684feed-forward 3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6-\u6cd5\u5411\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6216\u4f4e\u7eb9\u7406\u533a\u57df\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u67093D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ce8\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4f46\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684feed-forward 3DGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6-\u6cd5\u5411\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u6e32\u67d3\u6df1\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u9ad8\u65af\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u70b9\u4e91\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aAR\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite a large body of work focused on training frontier vision-language models (VLMs), approaches to their evaluation remain nascent. To guide their maturation, we propose three desiderata that evaluations should satisfy: (1) faithfulness to the modality and application, (2) discriminability between models of varying quality, and (3) efficiency in compute. Through this lens, we identify critical failure modes that violate faithfulness and discriminability, misrepresenting model capabilities: (i) multiple-choice formats reward guessing, poorly reflect downstream use cases, and saturate early as models improve; (ii) blindly solvable questions, which can be answered without images, constitute up to 70% of some evaluations; and (iii) mislabeled or ambiguous samples compromise up to 42% of examples in certain datasets. Regarding efficiency, the computational burden of evaluating frontier models has become prohibitive: by some accounts, nearly 20% of development compute is devoted to evaluation alone. Rather than discarding existing benchmarks, we curate them via transformation and filtering to maximize fidelity and discriminability. We find that converting multiple-choice questions to generative tasks reveals sharp capability drops of up to 35%. In addition, filtering blindly solvable and mislabeled samples improves discriminative power while simultaneously reducing computational cost.

However, a fundamental limitation persists: the deep entanglement of illumination and intrinsic appearance prevents controllable relighting. Existing disentanglement methods rely on strong assumptions to enable weakly supervised learning, which restricts their capacity for complex illumination. To address this challenge, we introduce HeadLighter, a novel supervised framework that learns a physically plausible decomposition of appearance and illumination in head generative models. Specifically, we design a dual-branch architecture that separately models lighting-invariant head attributes and physically grounded rendering components. A progressive disentanglement training is employed to gradually inject head appearance priors into the generative architecture, supervised by multi-view images captured under controlled light conditions with a light stage setup. We further introduce a distillation strategy to generate high-quality normals for realistic rendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method preserves high-quality generation and real-time rendering, while simultaneously supporting explicit lighting and viewpoint editing. We will publicly release our code and dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "HeadLighter\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u7f16\u8f91", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u611f\u77e5\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u903c\u771f\u4e14\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u5916\u89c2\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u63a7\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u8026\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdb\u884c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5149\u7167\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHeadLighter\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u5149\u7167\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5934\u50cf\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06\u5934\u50cf\u5916\u89c2\u5148\u9a8c\u6ce8\u5165\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u821e\u53f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u903c\u771f\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u663e\u5f0f\u5149\u7167\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "HeadLighter\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We study whether SparseLoCo, a low-communication data parallel method based on infrequent synchronization and sparse pseudo-gradient exchange, can be combined with low-bandwidth pipeline model parallelism via activation and activation-gradient compression. We introduce a heterogeneous distributed training framework where some participants host full replicas on high-bandwidth interconnects, while resource-limited participants are grouped to jointly instantiate a replica using pipeline parallelism with subspace-projected inter-stage communication. To make the recently introduced subspace pipeline compression compatible with SparseLoCo, we study a number of adaptations. Across large-scale language modeling experiments (178M-1B parameters) on standard pretraining corpora, we find that activation compression composes with SparseLoCo at modest cost, while selective (heterogeneous) compression consistently improves the loss-communication tradeoff relative to compressing all replicas-especially at aggressive compression ratios.

However, to our knowledge, the domain of two-person interactions, particularly in the context of martial arts combat, remains uncharted. We identify a significant gap: existing models for single-person dancing generation prove insufficient for capturing the subtleties and complexities of two engaged fighters, resulting in challenges such as identity confusion, anomalous limbs, and action mismatches. To address this, we introduce a pioneering new task, Personalized Martial Arts Combat Video Generation. Our approach, MagicFight, is specifically crafted to overcome these hurdles. Given this pioneering task, we face a lack of appropriate datasets. Thus, we generate a bespoke dataset using the game physics engine Unity, meticulously crafting a multitude of 3D characters, martial arts moves, and scenes designed to represent the diversity of combat. MagicFight refines and adapts existing models and strategies to generate high-fidelity two-person combat videos that maintain individual identities and ensure seamless, coherent action sequences, thereby laying the groundwork for future innovations in the realm of interactive video content creation.\n  Website: https://MingfuYAN.github.io/MagicFight/\n  Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MingfuYAN/KungFu-Fiesta", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53cc\u4eba\u6b66\u672f\u5bf9\u6218\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1MagicFight\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Unity\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4eba\u821e\u8e48\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cc\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6df7\u6dc6\u3001\u80a2\u4f53\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5355\u4eba\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u53cc\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6b66\u672f\u5bf9\u6218\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4eba\u821e\u8e48\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u53cc\u4eba\u6218\u6597\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8eab\u4efd\u6df7\u6dc6\u3001\u80a2\u4f53\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMagicFight\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528Unity\u6e38\u620f\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u53cc\u4eba\u6b66\u672f\u5bf9\u6218\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76843D\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u6b66\u672f\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u573a\u666f\u3002\u7136\u540e\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u6301\u4e2a\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u53cc\u4eba\u6218\u6597\u89c6\u9891", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53cc\u4eba\u6b66\u672f\u5bf9\u6218\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cc\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u89d2\u8272\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840", "conclusion": "MagicFight\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u53cc\u4eba\u6b66\u672f\u5bf9\u6218\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53cc\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840"}}

We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer.

Springer, Cham", "summary": "The automotive industry's pursuit of enhanced fuel economy and performance necessitates efficient aerodynamic design. However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u5207\u7247\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b3D\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u7a7a\u6c14\u963b\u529b\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f66\u8f86\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6cbf\u6d41\u5411\u8f74\u76842D\u622a\u9762\u5207\u7247\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PointNet2D\u548c\u53cc\u5411LSTM\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684Cd\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u8ffd\u6c42\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u71c3\u6cb9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6c14\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684CFD\u548c\u98ce\u6d1e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u6216\u5bf9\u8be6\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u8f93\u5165\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5c063D\u8f66\u8f86\u70b9\u4e91\u6cbf\u6d41\u5411\u8f74\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u5e8f\u76842D\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u5207\u7247\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5207\u7247\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7PointNet2D\u6a21\u5757\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5207\u7247\u5d4c\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411LSTM\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7eb5\u5411\u51e0\u4f55\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728DrivAerNet++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728Cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u51b3\u5b9a\u7cfb\u6570\uff08R^2 > 0.9528\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE \u2248 6.046\u00d710^{-3}\uff09\u3002\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u4e3a0.025\u79d2\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6c14\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6c7d\u8f66\u6c14\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u654f\u6377\u548c\u660e\u667a\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as pixel-level annotation is costly and time-consuming. To address this, recent methods leverage synthetic data or generate artificial change pairs, but out-of-domain generalization remains limited. In this work, we introduce a weak temporal supervision strategy that leverages additional temporal observations of existing single-temporal datasets, without requiring any new annotations. Specifically, we extend single-date remote sensing datasets with new observations acquired at different times and train a change detection model by assuming that real bi-temporal pairs mostly contain no change, while pairing images from different locations to generate change examples.

While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has become a key tool for large-scale oil spill monitoring, most existing detection methods rely on deep learning-based segmentation applied to single SAR images. These static approaches struggle to distinguish true oil spills from visually similar oceanic features (e.g., biogenic slicks or low-wind zones), leading to high false positive rates and limited generalizability, especially under data-scarce conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Oil Spill Change Detection (OSCD), a new bi-temporal task that focuses on identifying changes between pre- and post-spill SAR images. As real co-registered pre-spill imagery is not always available, we propose the Temporal-Aware Hybrid Inpainting (TAHI) framework, which generates synthetic pre-spill images from post-spill SAR data. TAHI integrates two key components: High-Fidelity Hybrid Inpainting for oil-free reconstruction, and Temporal Realism Enhancement for radiometric and sea-state consistency. Using TAHI, we construct the first OSCD dataset and benchmark several state-of-the-art change detection models. Results show that OSCD significantly reduces false positives and improves detection accuracy compared to conventional segmentation, demonstrating the value of temporally-aware methods for reliable, scalable oil spill monitoring in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOSCD\u4efb\u52a1\u548cTAHI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cb9\u6c61\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5e45SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u6cb9\u6c61\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6d77\u9762\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u751f\u7269\u6cb9\u819c\u3001\u4f4e\u98ce\u533a\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6cb9\u6c61\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08OSCD\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6ea2\u6cb9\u524d\u540eSAR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u914d\u51c6\u524d\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u4fee\u590d\uff08TAHI\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u540e\u6ea2\u6cb9SAR\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u524d\u56fe\u50cf\u3002TAHI\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cb9\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6df7\u5408\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u72b6\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u589e\u5f3a", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528TAHI\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2aOSCD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cOSCD\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bef\u62a5\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6cb9\u6c61\u76d1\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0cOSCD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84"}}

Existing debiasing approaches often address a single modality either visual or textual leading to partial robustness and unstable adaptation under distribution shifts. We propose a bilateral prompt optimization framework (BiPrompt) that simultaneously mitigates non-causal feature reliance in both modalities during test-time adaptation. On the visual side, it employs structured attention-guided erasure to suppress background activations and enforce orthogonal prediction consistency between causal and spurious regions. On the textual side, it introduces balanced prompt normalization, a learnable re-centering mechanism that aligns class embeddings toward an isotropic semantic space. Together, these modules jointly minimize conditional mutual information between spurious cues and predictions, steering the model toward causal, domain invariant reasoning without retraining or domain supervision.

However, multi-person identification remains largely unexplored, with the limited existing work relying on complex, expensive setups requiring modified firmware. A critical question remains unanswered: is poor multi-person performance an algorithmic limitation or a fundamental hardware constraint? We systematically evaluate six diverse signal separation methods (FastICA, SOBI, PCA, NMF, Wavelet, Tensor Decomposition) across seven scenarios with 1-10 people using commodity ESP32 WiFi sensors--a simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf solution. Through novel diagnostic metrics (intra-subject variability, inter-subject distinguishability, performance degradation rate), we reveal that all methods achieve similarly low accuracy (45-56\\%, $\u03c3$=3.74\\%) with statistically insignificant differences (p $>$ 0.05). Even the best-performing method, NMF, achieves only 56\\% accuracy.

While deep architectures achieve high accuracy on benchmarks like CUB-200-2011, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Conversely, shallow networks (e.g., AlexNet, VGG) offer efficiency but fail to distinguish visually similar sub-categories. This is because standard Global Average Pooling (GAP) heads capture only first-order statistics, missing the subtle high-order feature interactions required for FGVC. While Bilinear CNNs address this, they suffer from high feature dimensionality and instability during training. To bridge this gap, we propose the Quantum-inspired Interaction Classifier (QuIC). Drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics, QuIC models feature channels as interacting quantum states and captures second-order feature covariance via a learnable observable operator. Designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module, QuIC supports stable, single-stage end-to-end training without exploding feature dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that QuIC significantly revitalizes shallow backbones: it boosts the Top-1 accuracy of VGG16 by nearly 20% and outperforms state-of-the-art attention mechanisms (SE-Block) on ResNet18. Qualitative analysis, including t-SNE visualization, further confirms that QuIC resolves ambiguous cases by explicitly attending to fine-grained discriminative features and enforcing compact intra-class clustering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u7c7b\u5668QuIC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b97\u5b50\u6355\u83b7\u4e8c\u9636\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d45\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6df1\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u4ec5\u6355\u83b7\u4e00\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027CNN\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u7c7b\u5668QuIC\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b97\u5b50\u6355\u83b7\u4e8c\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\u3002", "result": "QuIC\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d45\u5c42\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u5c06VGG16\u7684Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fd120%\uff0c\u5728ResNet18\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236SE-Block\u3002t-SNE\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9eQuIC\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5173\u6ce8\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7c7b\u5185\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "QuIC\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6d45\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Yet, the performance of pathology foundation models across magnifications and the effect of magnification sampling during training remain poorly understood. We model magnification sampling as a multi-source domain adaptation problem and develop a simple theoretical framework that reveals systematic trade-offs between sampling strategies. We show that the widely used discrete uniform sampling of magnifications (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mpp) leads to degradation at intermediate magnifications. We introduce continuous magnification sampling, which removes gaps in magnification coverage while preserving performance at standard scales. Further, we derive sampling distributions that optimize representation quality across magnification scales. To evaluate these strategies, we introduce two new benchmarks (TCGA-MS, BRACS-MS) with appropriate metrics. Our experiments show that continuous sampling substantially improves over discrete sampling at intermediate magnifications, with gains of up to 4 percentage points in balanced classification accuracy, and that optimized distributions can further improve performance. Finally, we evaluate current histopathology foundation models, finding that magnification is a primary driver of performance variation across models.

Motivated by the distinct nature of modalities - where text is strictly sequential and images are inherently hierarchical - we retain next-token prediction for text but adopt next-scale prediction for visual generation.

However, practical deployment is severely hampered by the domain shift problem, where models trained in one environment fail to generalise to another. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage framework centred on a CSI-ResNet-A architecture. This model is pre-trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to learn domain-invariant representations and leverages lightweight Adapter modules for highly efficient fine-tuning. The resulting event sequence is then processed by a stateful counting machine to produce a final, stable occupancy estimate. We validate our framework extensively. On our WiFlow dataset, our unsupervised approach excels in a 10-shot learning scenario, achieving a final Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of just 0.44--a task where supervised baselines fail. To formally quantify robustness, we introduce the Generalisation Index (GI), on which our model scores near-perfectly, confirming its ability to generalise. Furthermore, our framework sets a new state-of-the-art public WiAR benchmark with 98.8\\% accuracy. Our ablation studies reveal the core strength of our design: adapter-based fine-tuning achieves performance within 1\\% of a full fine-tune (98.84\\% vs. 99.67\\%) while training 97.2\\% fewer parameters.

Existing LVSR methods often struggle to recover fine details due to limited contrast and insufficient high-frequency information. To overcome these challenges, we present RetinexEVSR, the first event-driven LVSR framework that leverages high-contrast event signals and Retinex-inspired priors to enhance video quality under low-light scenarios. Unlike previous approaches that directly fuse degraded signals, RetinexEVSR introduces a novel bidirectional cross-modal fusion strategy to extract and integrate meaningful cues from noisy event data and degraded RGB frames. Specifically, an illumination-guided event enhancement module is designed to progressively refine event features using illumination maps derived from the Retinex model, thereby suppressing low-light artifacts while preserving high-contrast details. Furthermore, we propose an event-guided reflectance enhancement module that utilizes the enhanced event features to dynamically recover reflectance details via a multi-scale fusion mechanism. Experimental results show that our RetinexEVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Notably, on the SDSD benchmark, our method can get up to 2.95 dB gain while reducing runtime by 65% compared to prior event-based methods.

Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u75282B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Qwen3-VL\u6307\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u548c1.6B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Sana1.5\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u9886\u57df\u867d\u7136\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u53c2\u6570\u5e9e\u5927\uff086B-20B\uff09\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8bb8\u591a\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4f7f\u75282B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Qwen3-VL\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u54081.6B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bSana1.5\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6e90\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImgEdit\u548cGEdit\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u591a\u51e0\u500d\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u64c5\u957f\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u7559\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u5c5e\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u79fb\u9664\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u66ff\u6362\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u970024GB GPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5728NVIDIA H100\u4e0a\u4ee5BF16\u7cbe\u5ea6\u751f\u62102K\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea64\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u7559\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms various baselines and remains flexible across text-to-image generation, image editing, and inference acceleration. Our method improves T2I-Combench++ from 56.92% to 63.00% and GenEval from 66.42% to 71.63% on SD3.5, without sacrificing synthesis quality.

Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose \\textbf{TopoLoRA-SAM}, a topology-aware and parameter-efficient adaptation framework for binary semantic segmentation. TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former. TopoLoRA-SAM achieves the best retina-average Dice and the best overall average Dice across datasets, while training only \\textbf{5.2\\%} of model parameters ($\\sim$4.9M). On the challenging CHASE\\_DB1 dataset, our method substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating that topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models.

However, this task remains challenging due to irregular nodule shapes, indistinct boundaries, substantial scale variations, and the presence of speckle noise that degrades structural visibility. To address these challenges, we propose a prior-guided DETR framework specifically designed for ultrasound nodule detection. Instead of relying on purely data-driven feature learning, the proposed framework progressively incorporates different prior knowledge at multiple stages of the network. First, a Spatially-adaptive Deformable FFN with Prior Regularization (SDFPR) is embedded into the CNN backbone to inject geometric priors into deformable sampling, stabilizing feature extraction for irregular and blurred nodules. Second, a Multi-scale Spatial-Frequency Feature Mixer (MSFFM) is designed to extract multi-scale structural priors, where spatial-domain processing emphasizes contour continuity and boundary cues, while frequency-domain modeling captures global morphology and suppresses speckle noise. Furthermore, a Dense Feature Interaction (DFI) mechanism propagates and exploits these prior-modulated features across all encoder layers, enabling the decoder to enhance query refinement under consistent geometric and structural guidance. Experiments conducted on two clinically collected thyroid ultrasound datasets (Thyroid I and Thyroid II) and two public benchmarks (TN3K and BUSI) for thyroid and breast nodules demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy compared with 18 detection methods, particularly in detecting morphologically complex nodules.The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjj1wjj/Ultrasound-DETR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684DETR\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u58f0\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u548c\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e18\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u58f0\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u548c\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u7ed3\u8282\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u4ee5\u53ca\u6591\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684DETR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) SDFPR\u6a21\u5757\u5728CNN\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b2) MSFFM\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u548c\u9891\u57df\u5904\u7406\uff1b3) DFI\u673a\u5236\u4f20\u64ad\u5148\u9a8c\u8c03\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u6240\u6709\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6(Thyroid I\u548cII)\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6(TN3K\u548cBUSI)\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e18\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfcDETR\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u58f0\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Directly regressing clean videos from adversarial inputs often fails to recover faithful content due to the subtle nature of perturbations; this necessitates physically shattering the adversarial structure. Therefore, we propose Flow Matching for Adversarial Video Purification FMVP. FMVP physically shatters global adversarial structures via a masking strategy and reconstructs clean video dynamics using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with an inpainting objective. To further decouple semantic content from adversarial noise, we design a Frequency-Gated Loss (FGL) that explicitly suppresses high-frequency adversarial residuals while preserving low-frequency fidelity.

While recent adapter-based approaches efficiently transfer RGB-pretrained foundation models to this task, they often prioritize model efficiency at the expense of cross-modal structural consistency. Consequently, critical structural cues are frequently lost when significant domain gaps arise, such as in high-contrast or nighttime environments. Moreover, conventional static multimodal fusion mechanisms typically lack environmental awareness, resulting in suboptimal adaptation and constrained detection performance under complex, dynamic scene variations. To address these limitations, we propose SLGNet, a parameter-efficient framework that synergizes hierarchical structural priors and language-guided modulation within a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model. Specifically, we design a Structure-Aware Adapter to extract hierarchical structural representations from both modalities and dynamically inject them into the ViT to compensate for structural degradation inherent in ViT-based backbones. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Guided Modulation module that exploits VLM-driven structured captions to dynamically recalibrate visual features, thereby endowing the model with robust environmental awareness. Extensive experiments on the LLVIP, FLIR, KAIST, and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that SLGNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the LLVIP benchmark, our method achieves an mAP of 66.1, while reducing trainable parameters by approximately 87% compared to traditional full fine-tuning.

In this paper, we propose DiffProxy, a novel framework that generates multi-view consistent human proxies for mesh recovery. Central to DiffProxy is leveraging the diffusion-based generative priors to bridge the synthetic training and real-world generalization. Its key innovations include: (1) a multi-conditional mechanism for generating multi-view consistent, pixel-aligned human proxies; (2) a hand refinement module that incorporates flexible visual prompts to enhance local details; and (3) an uncertainty-aware test-time scaling method that increases robustness to challenging cases during optimization. These designs ensure that the mesh recovery process effectively benefits from the precise synthetic ground truth and generative advantages of the diffusion-based pipeline. Trained entirely on synthetic data, DiffProxy achieves state-of-the-art performance across five real-world benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization particularly on challenging scenarios with occlusions and partial views.

While offline models like VGGT achieve inspiring geometry capability, their batch-based nature renders them irrelevant for live systems. Streaming architectures, though the intended solution for live operation, have proven inadequate. Existing methods either fail to support truly infinite-horizon inputs or suffer from catastrophic drift over long sequences. We shatter this long-standing dilemma with InfiniteVGGT, a causal visual geometry transformer that operationalizes the concept of a rolling memory through a bounded yet adaptive and perpetually expressive KV cache. Capitalizing on this, we devise a training-free, attention-agnostic pruning strategy that intelligently discards obsolete information, effectively ``rolling'' the memory forward with each new frame. Fully compatible with FlashAttention, InfiniteVGGT finally alleviates the compromise, enabling infinite-horizon streaming while outperforming existing streaming methods in long-term stability. The ultimate test for such a system is its performance over a truly infinite horizon, a capability that has been impossible to rigorously validate due to the lack of extremely long-term, continuous benchmarks. To address this critical gap, we introduce the Long3D benchmark, which, for the first time, enables a rigorous evaluation of continuous 3D geometry estimation on sequences about 10,000 frames. This provides the definitive evaluation platform for future research in long-term 3D geometry understanding.

GeoRank outperforms or matches prior methods that integrate geographical metadata and consistently improves diverse contrastive SSL algorithms (e.g., BYOL, DINO). Beyond this, we present a systematic investigation of key adaptations of contrastive SSL for multispectral RS images, including the effectiveness of data augmentations, the impact of dataset cardinality and image size on performance, and the task dependency of temporal views.

Neves"], "title": "SortWaste: A Densely Annotated Dataset for Object Detection in Industrial Waste Sorting", "comment": "9 pages", "summary": "The increasing production of waste, driven by population growth, has created challenges in managing and recycling materials effectively. Manual waste sorting is a common practice; however, it remains inefficient for handling large-scale waste streams and presents health risks for workers. On the other hand, existing automated sorting approaches still struggle with the high variability, clutter, and visual complexity of real-world waste streams. The lack of real-world datasets for waste sorting is a major reason automated systems for this problem are underdeveloped. Accordingly, we introduce SortWaste, a densely annotated object detection dataset collected from a Material Recovery Facility. Additionally, we contribute to standardizing waste detection in sorting lines by proposing ClutterScore, an objective metric that gauges the scene's hardness level using a set of proxies that affect visual complexity (e.g., object count, class and size entropy, and spatial overlap).

Received by RA-L", "summary": "Monocular omnidirectional visual odometry (OVO) systems leverage 360-degree cameras to overcome field-of-view limitations of perspective VO systems. However, existing methods, reliant on handcrafted features or photometric objectives, often lack robustness in challenging scenarios, such as aggressive motion and varying illumination. To address this, we present 360DVO, the first deep learning-based OVO framework. Our approach introduces a distortion-aware spherical feature extractor (DAS-Feat) that adaptively learns distortion-resistant features from 360-degree images. These sparse feature patches are then used to establish constraints for effective pose estimation within a novel omnidirectional differentiable bundle adjustment (ODBA) module. To facilitate evaluation in realistic settings, we also contribute a new real-world OVO benchmark. Extensive experiments on this benchmark and public synthetic datasets (TartanAir V2 and 360VO) demonstrate that 360DVO surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (including 360VO and OpenVSLAM), improving robustness by 50% and accuracy by 37.5%.

However, in case of flood mapping using Sen1Flood11 dataset as a downstream task, GFMs struggles to outperform the baseline U-Net, highlighting model's limitation in capturing critical local nuances. To address this, we present the Prithvi-Complementary Adaptive Fusion Encoder (CAFE), which integrate Prithvi GFM pretrained encoder with a parallel CNN residual branch enhanced by Convolutional Attention Modules (CAM). Prithvi-CAFE enables fast and efficient fine-tuning through adapters in Prithvi and performs multi-scale, multi-level fusion with CNN features, capturing critical local details while preserving long-range dependencies. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two comprehensive flood mapping datasets: Sen1Flood11 and FloodPlanet. On Sen1Flood11 test data, Prithvi-CAFE (IoU 83.41) outperforms the original Prithvi (IoU 82.50) and other major GFMs (TerraMind 82.90, DOFA 81.54, spectralGPT: 81.02). The improvement is even more pronounced on the hold-out test site, where Prithvi-CAFE achieves an IoU of 81.37 compared to the baseline U-Net (70.57) and original Prithvi (72.42). On FloodPlanet, Prithvi-CAFE also surpasses the baseline U-Net and other GFMs, achieving an IoU of 64.70 compared to U-Net (60.14), Terramind (62.33), DOFA (59.15) and Prithvi 2.0 (61.91). Our proposed simple yet effective Prithvi-CAFE demonstrates strong potential for improving segmentation tasks where multi-channel and multi-modal data provide complementary information and local details are critical.

Submitted to ICPR 2026", "summary": "Contactless fingerprint recognition offers a hygienic and convenient alternative to contact-based systems, enabling rapid acquisition without latent prints, pressure artifacts, or hygiene risks. However, contactless images often show degraded ridge clarity due to illumination variation, subcutaneous skin discoloration, and specular reflections. Flash captures preserve ridge detail but introduce noise, whereas non-flash captures reduce noise but lower ridge contrast. We propose Fusion2Print (F2P), the first framework to systematically capture and fuse paired flash-non-flash contactless fingerprints. We construct a custom paired dataset, FNF Database, and perform manual flash-non-flash subtraction to isolate ridge-preserving signals.

The central thesis proposes that learning, across physical, biological, and computational systems, fundamentally constitutes the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, we establish a formal isomorphism between thermodynamic processes and Bayesian updating, demonstrating that sustainable learning systems must follow dissipative patterns where crystallized posteriors become priors for subsequent levels of emergence.\n  We derive fundamental mathematical constants (e, \u03c0, \u03c6) as fixed points of Bayesian inference under minimal axioms, suggesting these constants emerge necessarily from any system capable of representing and updating uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture linking G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems to thermodynamic constraints, hypothesizing that pathologies of formal systems (incompleteness, undecidability) are structurally analogous to dissipation deficits in physical systems.\n  As practical validation, we present a peer-to-peer network architecture implementing BEDS principles, achieving six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing distributed consensus systems while enabling continuous learning.

However, these methods often treat the semantic and rendering branches separately, relying solely on 2D supervision while ignoring the 3D Gaussian geometry. Moreover, current adaptive strategies adapt the Gaussian set depending solely on rendering gradients, which can be insufficient in subtle or textureless regions. In this work, we propose a joint enhancement framework for 3D semantic Gaussian modeling that synergizes both semantic and rendering branches. Firstly, unlike conventional point cloud shape encoding, we introduce an anisotropic 3D Gaussian Chebyshev descriptor using the Laplace-Beltrami operator to capture fine-grained 3D shape details, thereby distinguishing objects with similar appearances and reducing reliance on potentially noisy 2D guidance. In addition, without relying solely on rendering gradient, we adaptively adjust Gaussian allocation and spherical harmonics with local semantic and shape signals, enhancing rendering efficiency through selective resource allocation. Finally, we employ a cross-scene knowledge transfer module to continuously update learned shape patterns, enabling faster convergence and robust representations without relearning shape information from scratch for each new scene.

Deep learning models can detect diseases from leaf images with high accuracy, but these models are typically too large and computationally expensive to run on low-cost edge devices such as Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, collecting thousands of labeled disease images for training is both expensive and time-consuming. This paper addresses both challenges by combining neural network pruning -- removing unnecessary parts of the model -- with few-shot learning, which enables the model to learn from limited examples. This paper proposes Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS), a method that identifies which parts of the neural network are most important for distinguishing between different plant diseases, integrated into a three-stage Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline. Experiments on PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces model size by 78\\% while maintaining 92.3\\% of the original accuracy, with the compressed model running at 7 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 4, making real-time field diagnosis practical for smallholder farmers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDACIS\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cPMP\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u630192.3%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c1178%\uff0c\u4f7f\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u6811\u8393\u6d3e\u4e0a\u4ee57FPS\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u519c\u6c11\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6216\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u6536\u96c6\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6602\u8d35\u8017\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDisease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5bf9\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP)\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728PlantVillage\u548cPlantDoc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c1178%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630192.3%\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6811\u8393\u6d3e4\u4e0a\u80fd\u4ee57\u5e27/\u79d2\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5b9e\u65f6\u7530\u95f4\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u53d8\u5f97\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Spatially manipulating objects in a scene through natural language poses a challenge for multimodal generation systems. While existing text-based manipulation methods can adjust appearance or style, they struggle to perform object-level geometric transformations-such as translating, rotating, or resizing objects-due to scarce paired supervision and pixel-level optimization limits. Talk2Move employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explore geometric actions through diverse rollouts generated from input images and lightweight textual variations, removing the need for costly paired data. A spatial reward guided model aligns geometric transformations with linguistic description, while off-policy step evaluation and active step sampling improve learning efficiency by focusing on informative transformation stages. Furthermore, we design object-centric spatial rewards that evaluate displacement, rotation, and scaling behaviors directly, enabling interpretable and coherent transformations. Experiments on curated benchmarks demonstrate that Talk2Move achieves precise, consistent, and semantically faithful object transformations, outperforming existing text-guided editing approaches in both spatial accuracy and scene coherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Talk2Move\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7269\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u5916\u89c2\u6216\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6267\u884c\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u7f29\u653e\uff09\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6210\u5bf9\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\u63a2\u7d22\u51e0\u4f55\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u53d8\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316rollout\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f4d\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTalk2Move\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Talk2Move\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits.

Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faExposeAnyone\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8868\u60c5\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd54.22\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u4f2a\u9020\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ec5\u4ece\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5224\u522b\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faExposeAnyone\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8868\u60c5\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4e3b\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u8ba1\u7b97\u7591\u4f3c\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728DF-TIMIT\u3001DFDCP\u3001KoDF\u548cIDForge\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747AUC\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524dSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa4.22\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b2) \u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4bSora2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u800c\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b3) \u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u7b49\u5e72\u6270\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ExposeAnyone\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u672a\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}
