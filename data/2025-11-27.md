### [1] [Pygmalion Effect in Vision: Image-to-Clay Translation for Reflective Geometry Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21098)
*Gayoung Lee,Junho Kim,Jin-Hwa Kim,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Pygmalion Effect框架，通过图像到黏土转换来抑制反射线索，提升反射物体的3D重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D重建中反射导致的表观和几何纠缠问题，反射使重建变得困难

Method: 采用双分支网络：基于BRDF的反射分支和黏土引导分支，联合训练并使用合成的黏土样图像作为无反射监督信号

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上显著提升了法向精度和网格完整性，优于现有反射处理方法

Conclusion: 通过'去光泽化'将辐射转换为中性表示，可以作为反射物体几何学习的强大归纳偏置

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

*Dianbing Xi,Jiepeng Wang,Yuanzhi Liang,Xi Qiu,Jialun Liu,Hao Pan,Yuchi Huo,Rui Wang,Haibin Huang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff是一个统一的扩散框架，同时解决视频理解和可控视频生成问题。通过结合几何和基于图形的模态（深度、法线、分割、边缘、材质属性等），实现了更精确的视频控制和编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仅使用几何线索的方法不足以约束外观、材质和光照，限制了物理上有意义的编辑（如重新照明、材质替换），并常导致时间漂移。需要更丰富的多模态约束来消除歧义并实现精确控制。

Method: 提出CtrlVDiff扩散模型，采用混合模态控制策略（HMCS）来路由和融合多种模态特征，包括深度、法线、分割、边缘和图形学固有属性（反照率、粗糙度、金属度）。构建了MMVideo混合数据集进行训练。

Result: 在理解和生成基准测试中，CtrlVDiff实现了卓越的可控性和保真度，支持分层编辑（重新照明、材质调整、对象插入），超越了现有最先进方法，并在某些模态缺失时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过结合几何和图形学模态，CtrlVDiff在统一的扩散框架内成功解决了视频理解和可控生成的挑战，实现了时间一致的高质量视频编辑和生成。

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

### [3] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架，用于增强多模态视觉语言模型对成员推理攻击的隐私保护能力，实验表明该方法能显著降低攻击成功率而不显著影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的广泛部署，隐私泄露风险日益突出。现有研究主要关注单模态系统的隐私攻击，而多模态模型对隐私攻击的脆弱性及其神经启发的防御机制尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入系统性的神经科学启发拓扑正则化框架(tau)，在三种视觉语言模型(BLIP、PaliGemma 2、ViT-GPT2)上应用，使用COCO、CC3M和NoCaps三个基准数据集进行实验比较。

Result: 在BLIP模型上，神经启发的VLM使成员推理攻击成功率平均ROC-AUC下降24%，同时保持相似的模型效用(MPNet和ROUGE-2指标)。其他模型和数据集上的实验进一步验证了结果的一致性。

Conclusion: 神经启发的多模态视觉语言模型对隐私攻击具有更强的抵抗力，且不会显著影响模型性能，这为理解多模态模型隐私风险提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

### [4] [Inferix: A Block-Diffusion based Next-Generation Inference Engine for World Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20714)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix是一个专为世界模型设计的下一代推理引擎，通过优化的半自回归解码过程实现沉浸式世界合成，支持交互式视频流和评测，区别于高并发系统和传统视频扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型是智能体AI、具身AI和游戏等领域的核心模拟器，能够生成长序列、物理真实且交互式的高质量视频。扩展这些模型可能解锁视觉感知、理解和推理的新兴能力，超越当前以LLM为中心的视觉基础模型范式。

Method: 采用半自回归（块扩散）解码范式，结合扩散和自回归方法的优势，在块内应用扩散生成视频token，同时以前面块为条件，实现更连贯稳定的视频序列。通过重新引入LLM风格的KV缓存管理，克服标准视频扩散的限制。

Result: Inferix实现了高效、可变长度和高质量的视频生成，支持交互式视频流和性能分析，能够实时交互和真实模拟世界动态。

Conclusion: Inferix作为专门为世界模拟设计的推理引擎，通过优化的半自回归解码和集成LV-Bench评测基准，为世界模型探索提供了强大支持，希望社区共同推进其发展。

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

### [5] [Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20716)
*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LTED-Ada算法，在移动边缘计算环境中自适应选择本地跟踪或边缘检测，通过深度强化学习优化视频对象识别的帧率、准确性和延迟需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限设备（如交通摄像头）的视频对象识别面临挑战，需要平衡本地跟踪的快速性和边缘检测的准确性。

Method: 基于深度强化学习，在单设备场景提出LTED-Ada算法自适应选择策略；在多设备场景使用联邦学习进行协作策略训练。

Result: 通过硬件在环实验验证了LTED-Ada的优越性能，能够适应不同帧率和性能要求。

Conclusion: LTED-Ada算法有效解决了移动边缘网络中视频对象识别的优化问题，在单设备和多设备场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

### [6] [DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720)
*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD是一个无需训练的动作引导早期退出框架，通过评估中间轨迹的物理可行性来加速VLA规划模型推理，在保持规划质量的同时减少28%的Transformer层使用和29%的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在自动驾驶中统一了感知、推理和轨迹生成，但由于深层Transformer堆栈导致推理延迟显著，需要加速方案。

Method: 提出基于物理可行性的早期退出机制，当预测轨迹与轻量级规划先验（如导航或低精度规划）在可容忍偏差（<2m）内对齐时终止推理；引入多跳控制器根据分数变化率自适应跳过冗余层。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，实现了高达28%的Transformer层稀疏化和29%的延迟减少，同时保持了规划质量和安全性。

Conclusion: DeeAD框架无需重新训练即可集成到现有VLA模型中，有效加速推理过程，为自动驾驶规划提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [7] [Foundry: Distilling 3D Foundation Models for the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20721)
*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Foundation Model Distillation (FMD)新范式，用于将大型自监督学习模型压缩成紧凑高效的代理模型，保留其通用表示能力。Foundry是该范式的首个3D点云实现，通过训练学生学习压缩的SuperTokens来重建教师模型的token级表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型虽然功能强大，但巨大的尺寸和计算成本使其难以部署在边缘设备上。现有压缩技术会牺牲模型的通用性，而FMD旨在保持这种关键的下游无关通用性。

Method: Foundry方法训练学生学习一组压缩的SuperTokens，这些SuperTokens能够重建教师模型的token级表示，捕获其潜在空间的紧凑基础。

Result: 单个蒸馏模型在多种下游任务（分类、部件分割、少样本场景）上保持强大的可迁移性，接近完整基础模型的性能，同时使用显著更少的token和FLOPs。

Conclusion: FMD范式能够创建紧凑、高效且忠实的基础模型代理，使其更适合在资源受限的硬件上部署。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

### [8] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer是基于DINOv2的模型，用于定位生成式修复图像中的篡改区域。通过在线性分类头上训练，在14×14补丁分辨率下预测篡改，采用滑动窗口策略处理大图像，在多个修复数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的局部篡改检测方法在生成式修复图像上表现不佳，需要开发专门针对语义篡改区域的检测方法。

Method: 在DINOv2预训练模型基础上添加线性分类头，使用滑动窗口策略处理大图像，通过后处理精炼二进制篡改掩码。

Result: DinoLizer在多个修复数据集上超越最先进的局部篡改检测器，平均IoU提高12%，对常见后处理操作保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Vision Transformers在此任务中表现出强大的表征能力，DinoLizer在深度伪造定位中优于DINOv3。

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CANVAS是一个评估视觉语言模型在工具调用界面设计能力的基准，包含598个基于工具的设计任务，涵盖设计复制和设计修改两种任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏评估视觉语言模型使用设计软件工具进行界面设计能力的基准，而理解这种能力对于模型与设计师在常规软件中协作具有重要意义。

Method: 构建包含598个工具设计任务的CANVAS基准，任务基于3.3K个移动UI设计，分为设计复制（重现整个UI屏幕）和设计修改（修改现有屏幕特定部分）两种类型。

Result: 领先模型展现出更具策略性的工具调用，提高了设计质量。研究还识别了模型常见的错误模式。

Conclusion: CANVAS基准填补了工具化设计评估的空白，为未来增强基于工具的设计能力提供了指导。

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出文本引导语义图像编码器(TIE)，通过文本查询条件化生成图像表示，在多个图像到文本基准测试中显著提升性能，同时减少图像token数量提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型中的图像编码器通常独立预训练，与语言模型对齐时无法考虑具体下游任务或文本查询，导致处理图像时缺乏针对性。

Method: 提出TIE方法，生成基于输入文本查询的条件化图像表示，使图像编码器能够根据具体查询调整特征提取。

Result: 在1B和3B规模下，TIE平均提升1.5和1.3个点，在DocVQA和InfoVQA等任务上提升高达6个点，同时仅使用一半图像tokens，显著提高推理效率。

Conclusion: 文本条件化训练能有效优化编码器捕捉关键视觉特征，TIE始终关注查询相关区域，增强可解释性和查询特定基础能力。

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

TL;DR: SMARC是一个从极稀疏视觉输入中同时进行表面材料重建和分类的统一模型，仅需10%的图像补丁即可重建完整RGB表面并分类材料


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集或全场景观测，在受限或部分视图环境中效果有限，需要解决从稀疏视觉线索理解材料表面的挑战

Method: 结合部分卷积U-Net和分类头的架构，在极端观测稀疏条件下实现空间修复和语义理解

Result: 在真实世界表面纹理数据集上达到PSNR 17.55 dB和材料分类准确率85.10%，优于其他五种模型

Conclusion: 部分卷积在缺失数据下的空间推理具有优势，为最小视觉表面理解奠定了坚实基础

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

TL;DR: LongVT是一个端到端的代理框架，通过多模态工具链思维实现长视频推理，利用LMMs的时间定位能力作为原生视频裁剪工具进行全局到局部的推理循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型在处理长视频时容易产生幻觉，因为证据稀疏且时间分散。受人类理解长视频的方式启发（先全局浏览再检查相关片段），需要开发能够进行细粒度视觉证据检索的框架。

Method: 利用LMMs的时间定位能力作为视频裁剪工具，通过全局到局部的推理循环逐步聚焦相关视频片段，并重新采样更细粒度的视频帧。采用三阶段训练策略：工具集成的冷启动监督微调、代理强化学习和代理强化微调。

Result: LongVT在四个具有挑战性的长视频理解和推理基准测试中持续优于现有强基线模型。发布了包含247.9K训练样本和1,280个QA对的评估基准VideoSIAH数据集。

Conclusion: LongVT通过多模态工具链思维和全局到局部的推理循环，有效解决了长视频推理中的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中表现出色，为长视频理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

*Souradeep Dutta,Keshav Bulia,Neena S Nair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对KRISP模型进行了轻量级复现，参数大幅减少但性能达到原版的75%，揭示了原模型的设计缺陷和实际问题，并在资源受限条件下验证了知识增强VQA架构的可扩展性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原版KRISP模型虽然有效，但工业级训练规模庞大、计算需求高且与大型骨干网络紧密耦合，需要重新审视其设计并开发轻量级版本以适应资源受限环境。

Method: 通过轻量级复现KRISP模型，大幅减少参数数量，在合成VQA数据和DAQUAR数据集上进行系统消融研究，验证知识增强VQA架构在资源约束下的表现。

Result: 复现模型性能达到原版的75%，同时揭示了原模型未充分覆盖的设计缺陷和实际问题，证明在低参数配置下仍能有效防止AI幻觉并生成限定知识域内的输出。

Conclusion: 轻量级KRISP模型能够在边缘设备上运行，实现离线视觉推理，为知识增强VQA架构在资源受限环境中的应用提供了可行性证明。

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain.

Motivation: 动态采样机制在计算机视觉模型中已证明有效，但缺乏统一的理论分析框架。本文旨在连接各种动态采样方法，为这些结构提供系统的理论分析。

Method: 开发了名为"warping"的通用算子来概括现有动态采样方法，包括可变形卷积、主动卷积单元和空间变换网络。通过将输入建模为IID变量和齐次随机场进行统计分析。

Result: 发现模型训练中前向和后向传播存在独特的不对称性，证明这些机制代表与传统平移不变卷积算子完全不同的正交算子类别。确定了确保动态采样网络稳定训练的必要条件。

Conclusion: warping算子为动态采样机制提供了最小化实现和理论分析框架，揭示了其与传统卷积算子的本质差异，并为稳定训练提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

TL;DR: Δ-NeRF是一个用于增量神经辐射场精化的模块化残差框架，通过残差控制器、不确定性感知门控机制和视图选择策略，实现在不访问历史数据的情况下持续优化NeRF模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF框架在引入新视图时需要完全重新训练，限制了其在卫星地形分析等数据顺序到达场景中的应用。增量精化方法存在灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出残差控制器向冻结的基础NeRF注入逐层修正；不确定性感知门控机制自适应结合基础和精化预测；视图选择策略减少训练数据；知识蒸馏压缩模型。

Result: 在卫星图像上，Δ-NeRF性能与联合训练相当，训练时间减少30-42%，PSNR比简单微调提高43.5%，在某些指标上超越联合训练。

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF为增量NeRF精化提供了有效解决方案，显著减少训练时间和数据需求，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

TL;DR: Split-then-Merge (StM) 是一个新颖的生成视频合成框架，通过将未标注视频分割为前景和背景层，然后自组合学习动态主体与场景的交互，解决了数据稀缺问题并增强了控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成视频合成中的数据稀缺问题和控制能力不足，传统方法依赖标注数据集或手工规则，而StM利用未标注视频学习复杂组合动态。

Method: 将未标注视频分割为动态前景和背景层，然后自组合学习交互；采用变换感知训练流程，包括多层融合增强和身份保持损失，实现感知组合并保持前景保真度。

Result: 在定量基准测试和人类/VLLM定性评估中，StM均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: StM框架通过分割-合并策略有效学习视频组合动态，在生成视频合成中实现了更好的控制能力和真实感。

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Method: 使用程序化生成方法创建包含多种元素（图案、瓦片、图表等）的谜题，每个谜题都配有可验证的真实解。基准测试涵盖25种任务类型，并采用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）来提升模型性能。

Result: 评估显示，即使是当前最先进的GPT-5模型在Sphinx基准上仅达到51.1%的准确率，远低于人类表现。使用RLVR方法显著提高了模型在这些任务上的准确性，并在外部视觉推理基准上取得了改进。

Conclusion: Sphinx基准揭示了当前大型视觉语言模型在核心视觉推理任务上的局限性，同时证明了强化学习与可验证奖励方法在提升多模态推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖计算昂贵的扩散先验网络将文本嵌入转换为视觉流形，这些先验需要大量训练数据和计算资源。本文质疑这种先验的必要性。

Method: 使用优化视觉反演(OVI)方法，从随机伪标记初始化潜在视觉表示，通过迭代优化最大化与文本嵌入的余弦相似度，并引入马氏距离和最近邻损失两种约束来正则化优化过程。

Result: 在Kandinsky 2.2上的实验表明，OVI可作为传统先验的替代方案。分析还揭示了当前评估基准T2I-CompBench++的缺陷，其中仅使用文本嵌入作为先验就能获得高分但感知质量较低。约束OVI方法在视觉保真度上优于基线，最近邻方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 优化视觉反演方法有潜力替代传统扩散先验，无需训练和数据，值得进一步研究。最近邻约束方法在定量评分上可与最先进的数据高效先验相媲美。

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTr是一个用于血管树中心线生成的3D图像到图模型，通过循环精炼汇合轨迹来生成中心线图，在保持高召回率的同时减少参数并提高推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床应用中，准确检测血管树中心线并保持正确的树状拓扑结构至关重要，因为遗漏小分支可能导致致命错误。需要高召回率来确保完整评估和异常检测。

Method: 采用Producer-Refiner架构，基于Transformer解码器。Producer提出初始汇合轨迹，Refiner循环精炼这些轨迹生成最终轨迹形成中心线图。使用汇合轨迹表示法确保有效树拓扑，并引入空间树图的高效非极大值抑制算法。

Result: 在多个公共中心线数据集上，RefTr实现了优于先前SOTA的召回率和相当的精确度，同时提供更快的推理速度和显著减少的参数（解码器参数减少2.4倍）。

Conclusion: RefTr展示了作为3D医学成像中血管树分析的新SOTA框架的潜力，在保持高召回率的同时实现了效率和参数数量的优化。

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角目标对应任务（如ego-exo目标对应）由于视角和外观的剧烈变化，使得现有分割模型（如SAM2）难以直接应用，需要专门的方法来处理这些挑战。

Method: 提出了两个互补的提示生成器：基于DINOv3特征的跨视角锚点提示生成器（V^2-Anchor）实现几何感知对应，以及跨视角视觉提示生成器（V^2-Visual）通过视觉提示匹配器增强外观引导线索。采用多专家设计和后验循环一致性选择器（PCCS）自适应选择最可靠的专家。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D（ego-exo目标对应）、DAVIS-2017（视频目标跟踪）和HANDAL-X（机器人就绪的跨视角对应）上取得了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: V^2-SAM通过统一的跨视角对应框架，有效解决了视角和外观变化带来的挑战，在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐方法容易导致目标奖励函数欠优化或过优化（奖励黑客），需要一种更稳健的对齐方法。

Method: 通过优化无分类器引导中的无条件嵌入而非潜在变量或噪声变量，在语义连贯的流形上进行对齐，直接引导模型的生成分布朝向目标奖励。

Result: Null-TTA在目标测试时对齐方面达到最先进水平，同时保持强大的跨奖励泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语义空间优化成为测试时对齐的有效且原则性的新范式。

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

Motivation: 传统隐式神经表示缺乏显式几何结构，局部编辑能力有限，难以与物理模拟集成，限制了在动态或交互式场景中的应用。

Method: 将可训练高斯分布与基于神经网络的INR结合，对给定图像坐标检索K个最近高斯分布，聚合距离加权的嵌入，通过神经网络预测RGB值。

Result: 实现了连续图像表示、可解释几何结构、灵活局部编辑，为物理感知和交互式图像操作提供了基础。

Conclusion: GaINeR框架成功解决了传统INR在几何结构和局部编辑方面的局限性，为动态和交互式图像处理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Conclusion: UruDendro4数据集填补了木材横截面数据空白，支持年轮体积建模，为自动年轮检测提供了有价值的基准和训练数据。

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

Conclusion: 这种描述符感知的视觉模型，结合标记级和对齐损失训练，无需配对图像-报告数据即可改善自动报告指标和临床效果。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了表达性图像合成任务，这是一个新的图像合成定义，强调风格多样性和宽松的放置逻辑，反映了用户在真实创意平台上的编辑行为。作者开发了StickerNet框架，通过两阶段方法预测合成参数，并在真实用户编辑数据上训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像合成研究主要关注视觉真实性和语义合理性，但在现代内容创作中，许多合成并不旨在保持真实感，而是追求艺术性、趣味性和社交参与度。本文从在线平台用户行为中获得灵感，定义了一个更符合实际编辑场景的表达性合成任务。

Method: 提出了StickerNet两阶段框架：首先确定合成类型，然后预测不透明度、遮罩、位置和尺度等放置参数。不同于之前通过模拟对象放置在真实图像上构建数据集的方法，本研究直接从匿名在线视觉创作平台的180万次编辑行为中构建数据集。

Result: 用户研究和定量评估表明，StickerNet优于常见基线方法，并与人工作放置行为高度匹配，证明了从真实世界编辑模式中学习的有效性，尽管任务本身存在固有的模糊性。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了视觉理解的新方向，强调表达性和用户意图而非真实性，为图像编辑研究开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

Motivation: 多摄像头交通视频数据量大，传统方法使用VLM将视频转为文本再通过LLM分析耗时较长，无法及时生成交通洞察和调查事件。

Method: 采用顺序处理方式，利用摄像头重叠覆盖区域，迭代应用不同token限制的VLM，将前一个摄像头的输出作为后续摄像头的提示，并通过对象级相似性检测器智能跳过冗余VLM调用。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验结果显示，TrafficLens将视频到文本的转换时间减少了高达4倍，同时保持了信息准确性。

Conclusion: TrafficLens通过优化多摄像头交通视频分析流程，显著提高了处理效率，为智能交通系统提供了更及时的视频分析能力。

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

Conclusion: 该无反转框架通过双整流流和动态融合机制，实现了高效、高质量的图像风格迁移，避免了传统反转方法的局限性。

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Conclusion: 该方法为Ref-COD提供了一种简单、高效的路径，无需强制性的测试时参考图像。

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: GuardTrace-VL能够有效检测推理过程中出现的不安全内容，显著提升了多模态大推理模型的安全性防护能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

*Yuhang Liu,Wenjie Zhao,Yunhui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaRank是一个基于元学习的框架，用于自动选择最适合特定任务的模型迁移性评估指标，解决了传统方法依赖单一指标或历史平均性能的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型迁移性评估指标选择往往是临时性的或仅基于历史平均性能，但实际中不同指标在不同任务上的效果差异很大，没有一个通用最优指标。

Method: 将指标选择建模为学习排序问题，使用预训练语言模型编码数据集和指标的文本描述，在共享语义空间中嵌入，通过元预测器学习数据集特征与指标机制的关系，采用列表式优化目标。

Result: 在11个预训练模型和11个目标数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法具有显著的有效性。

Conclusion: MetaRank能够基于新目标数据集的文本描述高效排序候选指标，帮助实践者先验地选择最合适的模型迁移性评估指标。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

*Haojian Huang,Jiahao Shi,Zhe Liu,Harold Haodong Chen,Han Fang,Hao Sun,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于原型的新型可信多视图分类框架，通过简化视图内邻居关系学习并实现视图间结构动态对齐，提高多视图共识发现的效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可信多视图分类方法依赖全局密集邻居关系建模视图内依赖，导致计算成本高且无法直接保证视图间关系一致性，同时缺乏对多视图邻居结构在类别空间一致性的保证。

Method: 引入原型来表示每个视图的邻居结构，简化视图内邻居关系学习，实现视图内和视图间结构的动态对齐，从而促进跨视图共识的高效一致发现。

Result: 在多个公开多视图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在性能和鲁棒性方面与主流可信多视图分类方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于原型的框架能够更有效地处理多源异构信息，提高多视图分类的可信度。

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

### [42] [CameraMaster: Unified Camera Semantic-Parameter Control for Photography Retouching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21024)
*Qirui Yang,Yang Yang,Ying Zeng,Xiaobin Hu,Bo Li,Huanjing Yue,Jingyu Yang,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CameraMaster是一个统一的相机感知框架，通过解耦相机指令和参数嵌入来实现精确的图像修饰控制，解决了现有方法在参数控制精度和可扩展性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的扩散模型在图像修饰时难以实现物理一致的精确参数控制（如曝光、白平衡、缩放），要么依赖模糊的文本提示，要么需要为不同参数训练独立模块，限制了可扩展性和多参数组合能力。

Method: 提出CameraMaster框架，显式解耦相机指令和参数嵌入：使用相机参数嵌入调制指令和内容语义，通过交叉注意力将调制后的指令注入内容特征，同时在去噪过程中将指令和相机嵌入作为条件和门控信号进行统一层间调制。

Result: 在78K图像-提示对数据集上的实验表明，CameraMaster对参数变化产生单调且近似线性的响应，支持无缝多参数组合，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CameraMaster通过统一的相机感知框架实现了精确的图像修饰控制，在参数敏感性、可扩展性和多参数组合方面表现出色。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CaptionQA基准测试，通过下游任务效用评估图像描述质量，涵盖4个领域，包含33,027个多选题，揭示当前模型在描述效用方面存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法未能回答一个基本问题：描述能否在实际下游任务中替代图像？需要基于效用的基准来评估模型生成的描述质量。

Method: 构建可扩展的领域相关基准，包含4个领域（自然、文档、电商、具身AI）的细粒度分类，创建33,027个密集标注的多选题，通过LLM仅使用描述回答问题来直接测量描述效用。

Result: 评估最先进的多模态大模型发现，图像与其描述效用之间存在显著差距。在传统图像QA基准上表现相近的模型，在描述效用上最多下降32%。

Conclusion: CaptionQA基准揭示了当前图像描述模型在保持图像级效用方面的不足，为评估和改进描述质量提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

Motivation: 现有音乐到舞蹈生成方法效率有限，无法为高保真3D渲染留出足够计算空间，限制了3D角色在真实应用中的表现力。

Method: 结合MeanFlow与物理一致性约束实现高质量动作生成；采用BiMamba骨干网络和通道级跨模态融合的简单高效架构；支持非自回归生成和动作编辑功能。

Result: 在AIST++和FineDance数据集上的实验表明，FlowerDance在动作质量和生成效率方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FlowerDance不仅生成具有物理合理性和艺术表现力的精细动作，还在推理速度和内存利用方面实现了显著的生成效率提升。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 区域级语义对齐和多智能体协作在结节诊断中至关重要，LungNoduleAgent是支持临床肺部结节分析的有前景的基础工具。

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的图像去模糊框架，通过将生成先验与显式物理约束相结合，解决了传统方法在物理准确性和感知质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法存在两极化问题：基于模型的深度展开方法虽然能强制物理约束但会产生过度平滑和伪影，而生成模型虽然感知质量好但会因物理约束弱而产生幻觉细节。需要一种能同时保证物理准确性和感知真实性的方法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的严重模糊场景中，该方法在物理准确性和感知真实性方面都优于最先进的基于模型方法和生成基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥合了物理准确性和感知真实性之间的差距，为空间变化图像去模糊提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE是一个统一的图像情感合成框架，能够同时进行情感生成和编辑，通过梯度优化情感token、语义相似度确定最佳时机、多情感损失减少干扰，无需额外训练扩散模型或专门数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像情感合成方法将生成和编辑任务人为分离，造成效率低下，限制了在治疗干预、故事讲述等自然交织任务中的应用。

Method: 采用概念上对齐测试时缩放(TTS)的策略，利用现成情感分类器进行梯度优化情感token，通过语义相似度确定情感引导时机，使用多情感损失减少固有和相似情感的干扰。

Result: 实验结果显示MUSE在生成和编辑任务上均优于所有方法，提高了情感准确性和语义多样性，同时在期望内容、文本提示符合度和真实情感表达之间保持最佳平衡。

Conclusion: MUSE为情感合成建立了新的范式，证明了统一框架在图像情感合成中的有效性。

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Conclusion: T-NIG模型能够在不规则时间分布的数据中有效预测阿尔茨海默病进展，同时保持疾病相关特征，展示了在长期预测中的优越性能。

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的图像编辑模型在处理复杂用户指令时经常无法准确理解组合关系、上下文线索或指代表达式，导致编辑结果语义漂移或无法反映预期变化。

Method: 提出MIRA多模态推理代理，采用迭代感知-推理-行动循环，逐步预测原子编辑指令，利用视觉反馈进行决策。使用150K多模态工具使用数据集MIRA-Editing和两阶段SFT+GRPO训练管道。

Result: 当与开源图像编辑模型（如Flux.1-Kontext、Step1X-Edit、Qwen-Image-Edit）配合使用时，MIRA显著提升了语义一致性和感知质量，性能达到或超过GPT-Image和Nano-Banana等专有系统。

Conclusion: MIRA通过模拟多轮人机交互过程，有效解决了复杂编辑指令的理解问题，为指令引导的图像编辑提供了更准确和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

Conclusion: EM-KD通过有效的视觉token对齐和双重蒸馏策略，成功解决了师生模型间不平衡视觉token的问题，为高效MLLMs的知识蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

Conclusion: FaithFusion通过EIG驱动的3DGS-扩散融合框架，成功解决了几何保真度和视觉逼真度之间的平衡问题，为可控驾驶场景重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DATGN的新型方法，通过自动学习脑部图像的形态变化来预测阿尔茨海默病的早期进展，能够处理不完整的时间序列MRI数据并生成未来的MRI图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一种退行性脑部疾病，早期预测有助于延缓其进展。当前预测方法主要依赖手动特征提取来分析脑部图像的形态变化，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: DATGN首先对不完整的MRI时间序列进行插值，然后通过双向时间变形感知模块指导网络生成符合疾病进展的未来MRI图像，从而实现早期预测。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验结果显示，DATGN在PSNR和MMSE图像质量指标上表现优异。将DATGN生成的合成数据集成到分类方法中，AD vs NC分类准确率提高了6.21%到16%，AD vs MCI vs NC分类准确率提高了7.34%到21.25%。

Conclusion: DATGN能够生成与阿尔茨海默病脑萎缩趋势一致的MRI图像，实现了早期疾病预测，为阿尔茨海默病的自动化诊断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

TL;DR: EntPruner是一个基于熵指导的自动渐进式剪枝框架，专门针对扩散模型和流模型，通过条件熵偏差评估模块重要性，实现高效模型压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉生成模型在下游任务中存在显著的参数冗余问题，需要一种专门针对生成模型的剪枝方法，既能保持输出多样性又能减少参数。

Method: 提出熵指导剪枝策略，使用条件熵偏差(CED)评估模块重要性；采用零样本自适应剪枝框架，动态决定剪枝时机和程度，避免一次性剪枝的问题。

Result: 在DiT和SiT模型上的实验表明，EntPruner实现了最高2.22倍的推理加速，同时在ImageNet和三个下游数据集上保持了有竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: EntPruner为生成模型提供了一种有效的剪枝解决方案，能够在保持生成质量的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度网络仍处于像素级学习阶段，无法让去模糊模型理解模糊的本质过程。模糊本质上是清晰图像与模糊核的卷积，因此让网络学习核级模糊过程能显著提升图像去模糊性能。

Method: 提出FKE方法，在傅里叶空间进行激活操作，将卷积对象从图像改为网络提取的特征，设计解耦多尺度架构，使用可逆策略的层次化子UNet实现高效多尺度编码解码。

Conclusion: FKE方法能够有效学习核级模糊过程，显著提升去模糊性能，且具有低复杂度和无需额外监督的优势。

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

TL;DR: 提出ProxyFormer用于视频目标分割，通过代理查询整合视觉和文本语义，建立帧间依赖关系，提高目标跟踪的准确性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态对齐时存在两个问题：条件查询缺乏帧间依赖和变化建模，难以应对帧间显著变化；文本约束集成过晚，可能导致视频特征关注非目标对象。

Method: 引入代理查询集来整合视觉和文本语义，通过多阶段视频特征编码器逐步更新和传播代理查询，将跨模态交互解耦为时间和空间维度，并设计联合语义一致性训练策略。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的RVOS基准测试上的综合实验表明，ProxyFormer优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ProxyFormer通过代理查询机制有效解决了跨模态对齐中的帧间依赖和语义集成问题，在视频目标分割任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全评估方法主要关注静态图像和文本生成，无法捕捉视频生成中复杂的时间动态性，而T2V模型的多样化生成带来了关键的安全挑战。

Method: 采用时间感知的测试生成器，通过两阶段优化：初始生成器训练和时间感知的在线偏好学习，结合循环精炼模型提高提示的隐蔽性和对抗效果。

Result: 在开源和商业T2V系统上进行了广泛实验评估，攻击成功率超过80%，相比之前最佳结果57%有显著提升。

Conclusion: TEAR框架能够有效揭示T2V模型中与时间序列相关的安全风险，证明了其在自动化安全评估中的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

TL;DR: LLaVA-UHD v3提出了渐进式视觉压缩(PVC)方法，可在标准ViT中实现高效的原生分辨率编码，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型倾向于使用全局原生分辨率视觉编码，虽然提升了整体能力但带来了更大的计算开销。为了解决这个问题，需要开发高效的视觉编码方法。

Method: 提出渐进式视觉压缩(PVC)方法，包含两个关键模块：精细化补丁嵌入（支持灵活补丁大小缩放）和窗口化token压缩（在ViT层间分层部署以逐步聚合局部token表示）。

Result: 转换后的ViT-UHD在相同MLLM架构下，与MoonViT相比性能相当但TTFT降低2.4倍；基于ViT-UHD的LLaVA-UHD v3与Qwen2-VL性能相当但TTFT进一步降低1.9倍。

Conclusion: PVC方法可以有效地将预训练ViT重构为高效架构，同时保持泛化能力，为高效MLLM研究提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

TL;DR: GridAR是一个视觉自回归模型的测试时扩展框架，通过网格分区渐进生成和布局指定提示重构策略，在有限计算资源下提升文本到图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展策略如Best-of-N在视觉自回归模型中效果不佳，因为光栅扫描解码缺乏整体画布蓝图，且错误生成轨迹消耗完整计算资源。

Method: 采用网格分区渐进生成方案，在同一画布位置生成多个部分候选，早期修剪不可行候选，固定可行候选作为锚点指导后续解码；结合布局指定提示重构策略，通过检查部分视图推断可行布局。

Result: 在N=4时，GridAR比Best-of-N（N=8）在T2I-CompBench++上性能提升14.4%，成本降低25.6%；在PIE-Bench上编辑质量相当，语义保持提升13.9%。

Conclusion: GridAR框架有效解决了视觉自回归模型测试时扩展的挑战，在有限计算资源下显著提升生成质量，并适用于图像编辑任务。

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

TL;DR: 提出AnchorOPT，一种动态锚点提示学习框架，通过动态学习锚点值和可学习位置矩阵来改进CLIP模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的提示学习方法使用静态锚点（在值和位置上都固定），缺乏跨任务和阶段自适应的灵活性。

Method: 引入动态锚点值（从任务特定数据学习而非手工设计）和可学习位置矩阵，采用两阶段训练：先学习锚点令牌，然后优化软令牌和位置矩阵。

Result: 仅使用简单的可学习锚点和位置矩阵就能达到或超过一些包含额外可学习模块或正则化技术的方法的性能。

Conclusion: AnchorOPT作为即插即用模块，能无缝集成到现有框架中，在多样化数据集上带来一致的性能提升。

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhengli97/ATPrompt.

Result: 在3D参考分割、3D视觉问答和3D密集描述任务上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D提供了一个紧凑统一的3D VLM架构，实现了细粒度的通用3D场景理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

Conclusion: DCBoost作为一种参数免费的插件方法，通过利用局部结构线索有效增强了深度聚类模型的全局特征结构，显著提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

Method: 1. 区域特定语义激活模块：使用文本约束语义作为查询，捕获每帧中动作相关区域响应；2. 构建动作轨迹：将区域响应组织成连贯序列；3. 多级轨迹对比约束：在空间和时间层面优化区域响应；4. 任务特定微调机制：优化文本语义表示。

Result: 在广泛使用的动作识别基准测试中，该方法优于先前的最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ART框架通过跟踪局部细节动态，有效解决了细粒度动作识别中相似动作区分困难的问题，在多个基准测试中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 使用统一的TinyUNet架构（<1.5M参数）在CIFAR-10上实现DDPM、CFM和MeanFlow三种方法。扩展CFM至图像修复，实现四种掩码类型的掩码引导采样。

Result: CFM在50步采样时FID为24.15，DDPM为402.98。MeanFlow单步采样FID为29.15。图像修复模型在中心掩码上PSNR从4.95提升至8.57 dB（+73%），SSIM从0.289提升至0.418（+45%）。

Conclusion: CFM在生成质量上显著优于DDPM，MeanFlow在保持良好生成质量的同时实现了50倍推理加速。CFM在图像修复任务中表现出色，修复感知训练能显著提升修复质量。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

TL;DR: T3-Tracer是一个用于检测部分音频伪造的三层次框架，通过联合分析帧、片段和音频级别来全面检测伪造痕迹，在三个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分音频伪造通过选择性修改关键帧而保持整体感知真实性，现有方法缺乏层次结构来捕捉不同时间级别的瞬时和持续异常。

Method: 提出T3-Tracer框架，包含帧-音频特征聚合模块(FA-FAM)和片段级多尺度差异感知模块(SMDAM)，联合分析帧、片段和音频三个层次。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数据集上进行广泛实验，证明该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: T3-Tracer通过多层次的联合分析，能够有效检测部分音频伪造，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: FIELDS提出了一种结合2D图像一致性和3D表情参数直接监督的双重监督方法，通过从4D面部扫描获取真实表情参数，并引入情感识别分支，解决了现有3D人脸重建方法在捕捉细微情感细节方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人脸重建方法依赖2D监督且缺乏3D真实数据，导致无法准确捕捉面部表情中的细微情感信息。

Method: 扩展自监督2D图像一致性线索，加入直接3D表情参数监督和辅助情感识别分支，使用4D面部扫描的真实表情参数指导编码器，并采用强度感知情感损失。

Result: 从单张图像生成情感丰富的3D人脸模型，具有高度真实的表情，显著提高了野外面部表情识别性能，同时保持自然度。

Conclusion: 双重监督策略弥合了2D/3D领域差距，减轻了表情强度偏差，产生了保留细微情感线索的高保真3D重建结果。

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR数据生成方法仅支持单帧生成，而预测方法需要多帧历史输入且只能确定性预测多帧，缺乏交互性，无法支持长序列交互生成。

Method: 引入场景解耦估计模块增强对象级内容的交互生成能力，以及噪声调制模块减轻长序列生成中的误差累积。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验结果表明，LaGen在长序列LiDAR场景生成方面全面优于现有最先进的LiDAR生成和预测模型，特别是在后续帧上表现更佳。

Conclusion: LaGen成功解决了长序列LiDAR场景生成问题，为自动驾驶提供了有效的生成式世界模型解决方案。

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

TL;DR: MatchGS是一个利用3D高斯泼溅技术生成高质量图像匹配训练数据的框架，通过几何校正和2D-3D表示对齐，显著提升了零样本图像匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的图像匹配需要大规模、多样化且几何准确的训练数据，但现有的3D高斯泼溅技术存在几何不准确和深度渲染偏差问题，限制了其在对应关系标注中的应用。

Method: 1) 几何忠实的数据生成流程：精炼3DGS几何以产生精确的对应关系标签；2) 2D-3D表示对齐策略：将3DGS的显式3D知识注入2D匹配器，引导学习视角不变的3D表示。

Result: 生成的对应关系将极线误差降低了40倍，在公共基准测试中零样本性能提升高达17.7%，显著优于现有数据集。

Conclusion: 通过适当的几何精炼，3DGS可以作为可扩展、高保真且结构丰富的数据源，为新一代鲁棒零样本图像匹配器铺平道路。

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Vision Transformer的方法虽然能捕捉全局上下文，但二次复杂度限制了在资源受限平台上的高效部署。而Mamba等状态空间模型具有线性时间效率，特别适合建模长连续结构。

Method: 提出PathMamba混合架构，策略性地使用Mamba块追踪道路网络的连续性质，保持拓扑结构，同时集成Transformer块通过全局上下文细化特征。

Conclusion: PathMamba在道路分割任务中实现了拓扑优越的分割结果，避免了纯基于注意力模型的过高扩展成本，为资源受限平台提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的3D纹理生成系统存在跨视图不一致问题，即从一个视角看合理的纹理在其他视角下无法对齐，这源于注意力模糊问题。

Method: 引入几何校准注意力框架，包含两个模块：部分对齐注意力（强制跨语义匹配部分的空间对齐）和条件路由注意力（通过几何条件路径路由外观信息以保持空间保真度），结合两阶段扩散变换器。

Result: CaliTex能够生成无缝且视图一致的纹理，在实验上优于开源和商业基线方法。

Conclusion: CaliTex通过将几何一致性作为网络的固有行为而非优化的副产品，有效解决了3D纹理生成中的跨视图不一致问题。

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

TL;DR: 提出HTTM方法，一种无需训练的3D token合并技术，用于加速VGGT模型在3D场景重建中的推理过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT模型在重建大场景时需要全局注意力计算，导致显著延迟瓶颈，现有token合并技术会损害模型表示能力

Method: 采用多头粒度token合并(HTTM)，在多头级别合并token以保持特征独特性，并利用空间局部性和时间对应性实现高合并比

Result: 在GPU推理中实现高达7倍加速，性能下降可忽略不计

Conclusion: HTTM有效解决了VGGT模型在大场景重建中的延迟问题，同时保持了模型性能

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

Conclusion: ConFu能够有效捕捉高阶多模态依赖关系，同时保持强成对对应关系，为多模态表示学习提供了统一的对比学习框架。

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN框架在保持空间特征基础的同时，实现了低延迟、高能效的结构异常检测，为可移动混凝土护栏等交通基础设施的安全监测提供了可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多尺度特征融合的点云法向量估计方法，通过特征聚合和补偿机制解决不同几何结构下邻域尺寸选择困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理不同数据或几何结构时难以确定合适的邻域尺寸，且参数繁重，无法准确高效地预测各种点云的法向量。

Method: 采用多尺度特征融合策略，包括特征聚合模块（逐步聚合不同尺度特征并缩小邻域）和特征补偿模块（重用大尺度特征并揭示不同邻域尺寸的关联信息）。

Conclusion: 基于多尺度特征聚合的近似策略能够实现不同局部邻域的尺度自适应，提供最优特征描述，显著提升法向量估计的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endo-G²T是一种用于动态内窥镜场景的几何引导和时间感知训练方案，通过几何先验蒸馏、时间嵌入高斯场和关键帧约束流式处理，解决了内窥镜视频中的视角依赖效应和几何漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜视频存在强烈的视角依赖效应（如镜面反射、湿润反射和遮挡），纯光度监督与几何不对齐，导致早期几何漂移问题，错误的形状在密集化过程中被强化且难以纠正。

Method: 1. 几何引导先验蒸馏：将置信度门控的单目深度转换为监督信号，使用尺度不变深度和深度梯度损失，采用预热到上限的调度来软注入先验避免早期过拟合。2. 时间嵌入高斯场：在XYZT空间中表示动态，使用转子式旋转参数化，通过轻量正则化实现时间一致的几何和清晰的不透明度边界。3. 关键帧约束流式处理：在最大点数预算下进行关键帧聚焦优化，非关键帧进行轻量更新，提高效率和长时稳定性。

Conclusion: Endo-G²T成功解决了内窥镜视频重建中的几何漂移问题，通过几何引导和时间感知的训练方案实现了高质量、时间一致的动态场景重建。

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

TL;DR: STVG-o1是一个无需修改架构即可让现有多模态大语言模型在时空视频定位任务中达到最先进性能的框架，通过边界框思维链机制和多维强化奖励函数实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在时空视频定位任务中表现不佳的问题，原因是训练目标不对齐和标准视觉编码器中细粒度区域-词语对齐较弱。

Method: 引入边界框思维链机制，在最终预测前明确推理时空位置；设计包含格式、一致性、时间、空间和思考奖励的多维强化奖励函数，通过强化微调提供几何感知监督。

Result: 在HCSTVG-v1/v2和VidSTG数据集上取得新的最先进结果，在HCSTVG-v1上m_tIoU比最佳任务特定方法提高7.3%，与VidSTG上的专用模型表现相当，大幅超越所有现有的基于MLLM的方法。

Conclusion: STVG-o1证明了多模态大语言模型可以作为精确时空定位任务的可行且强大的骨干网络，并展现出强大的跨数据集开放词汇泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

TL;DR: Monet是一个训练框架，使多模态大语言模型能够在潜在视觉空间中进行推理，通过生成作为中间视觉思维的连续嵌入。该框架解决了潜在视觉推理中的两个核心挑战：潜在视觉对齐的高计算成本和潜在嵌入监督不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在抽象视觉思维方面不如人类灵活，因为它们的灵活性受到外部工具的根本限制。需要让多模态大语言模型直接在潜在视觉空间中进行推理。

Conclusion: Monet框架成功实现了多模态大语言模型在潜在视觉空间中的直接推理，为视觉潜在推理的未来发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning. Our model, data, and code are available at https://github.com/NOVAglow646/Monet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型中无关信息（干扰项）对测试时扩展的影响，发现视觉干扰项与文本干扰项不同：虽然都存在逆向扩展效应，但视觉干扰项会降低准确性而不增加推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在多模态设置中，无关信息（干扰项）是否会产生与语言模型类似的逆向扩展效应，即干扰项导致推理更长但效果更差的现象。

Method: 引入Idis数据集，系统地在语义、数值和空间维度上变化视觉干扰项，分析推理轨迹中的属性计数，并提出简单的提示策略来减轻偏见驱动的预测。

Result: 视觉干扰项与文本干扰项存在根本差异：添加视觉干扰项会降低准确性但不增加推理长度。属性计数跟踪揭示了干扰项、推理长度和准确性之间的相互作用。这些趋势也适用于已建立的视觉偏见基准如Waterbirds。

Conclusion: 视觉干扰项在多模态环境中表现出独特的逆向扩展模式，提出的提示策略能有效减轻偏见驱动的预测，为理解视觉语言模型中的干扰效应提供了重要见解。

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉自回归模型在图像生成多样性方面存在严重不足，即使对于简单提示也会产生几乎相同的图像，这一问题在追求图像质量的主流研究中被忽视。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）在文本嵌入中注入噪声以增加多样性；2）提出尺度旅行技术，利用多尺度自编码器提取粗尺度标记，在中间阶段恢复生成以保持图像质量。

Result: 实验表明，文本嵌入噪声注入与尺度旅行精炼相结合，显著提升了生成多样性，同时最小化了图像质量下降，在多样性-质量权衡中达到了新的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: DiverseVAR框架有效解决了视觉自回归模型的多样性不足问题，无需重新训练或大量计算开销，为多样性-质量权衡提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: E-M3RF是一个等变多模态3D重组框架，通过结合几何和颜色特征，使用SE(3)流匹配来预测碎片重组所需的变换，在几何特征不足或模糊的情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的3D重组方法主要依赖几何特征，当几何信息不足（如小碎片、侵蚀碎片或对称碎片）时表现不佳，且缺乏防止重叠组装的物理约束。

Method: 使用旋转等变编码器提取几何特征，结合transformer提取颜色特征，形成多模态表示，通过SE(3)流匹配预测碎片变换。

Result: 在四个数据集上测试，在RePAIR数据集上相比竞争方法，旋转误差降低23.1%，平移误差降低13.2%，Chamfer距离减少18.4%。

Conclusion: E-M3RF通过结合多模态特征有效解决了传统方法在几何信息不足时的局限性，显著提升了3D重组的准确性。

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

TL;DR: 提出Merge-and-Bound (M&B)方法用于类增量学习，通过在参数空间中直接操作模型权重进行优化，包含任务间和任务内权重合并，以及有界更新技术来减少灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过直接操作模型权重来优化模型，同时保持对先前任务知识的保留。

Method: 使用两种权重合并：任务间权重合并（平均所有先前阶段模型的权重）和任务内权重合并（组合当前阶段内的模型参数）。采用有界更新技术来最小化累积更新并保留先前任务知识。

Result: 在标准CIL基准测试中表现出优于现有最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: M&B方法能够有效减少灾难性遗忘，无需修改架构组件或修订学习目标即可集成到现有CIL方法中。

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出基于交叉注意力的非局部知识蒸馏框架CanKD，通过交叉注意力机制让学生特征图的每个像素动态考虑教师特征图的所有像素，实现更彻底的知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自注意力蒸馏方法独立对齐师生特征图，无法充分捕捉像素间关系。需要一种能让学生特征动态考虑教师全局特征的非局部知识迁移方法。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制，让学生特征图的每个像素都能动态关注教师特征图的所有像素位置，仅通过额外损失函数实现知识蒸馏。

Result: 在目标检测和图像分割任务上的大量实验表明，CanKD优于现有的特征和混合蒸馏方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CanKD作为一种新的注意力引导蒸馏范式，在计算机视觉任务中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

Conclusion: 建立了一套稳健的、架构无关的最佳实践，用于未来深度伪造检测系统的设计和开发

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems. Our experiments identify a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and enable state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于抗核抗体(ANA)检测的新型多实例多标签学习框架，通过实例采样器、概率伪标签分发器和自步学习权重系数来处理临床显微镜图像中的复杂模式识别问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANA检测对于诊断自身免疫疾病至关重要，但手动检测耗时且需要专业训练。现有自动化方法难以处理临床环境中多实例多标签的复杂情况，需要开发能够处理未预处理显微镜图像的新方法。

Method: 基于人类标注逻辑，提出包含三个组件的框架：实例采样器建模模式置信度抑制低置信度实例，概率伪标签分发器根据实例可区分性自适应分配标签，自步学习权重系数根据经验标签观察调整训练。

Result: 在ANA数据集上比现有最佳方法提升7.0% F1-Macro和12.6% mAP，在三个公共医疗MIML基准测试中排名前2，汉明损失和单错误率分别降低18.2%和26.9%。

Conclusion: 该框架克服了传统MIML方法的限制，支持端到端优化，在ANA检测和医疗MIML任务中实现了最先进的性能，为临床自动化诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成反映疾病进展的MRI图像，为阿尔茨海默病的长期预后预测提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频奖励模型依赖像素空间输入，导致ReFL优化只能在VAE解码后的去噪步骤进行，造成内存开销大、训练时间长，且缺乏早期监督，只能优化视觉质量而非基本运动动态和结构连贯性。

Method: 利用预训练视频生成模型在噪声潜在空间进行奖励建模，提出PRFL框架，在潜在空间中进行偏好优化，实现整个去噪链的高效梯度反向传播，无需VAE解码。

Result: 实验表明PRFL显著提高了与人类偏好的对齐效果，同时大幅减少了内存消耗和训练时间，相比RGB ReFL有明显优势。

Conclusion: PRFL证明了在潜在空间进行奖励反馈学习的有效性，为视频生成对齐提供了更高效的方法，解决了像素空间方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Conclusion: 提出了一种通过高效利用多模态知识构建鲁棒3D视觉系统的新实用范式

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Conclusion: UAVLight为光照鲁棒3D重建方法的发展和基准测试提供了受控但真实的评估环境。

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

*Haotian Xue,Qi Chen,Zhonghao Wang,Xun Huang,Eli Shechtman,Jinrong Xie,Yongxin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGAN是一种专注于运动质量的视频生成后训练框架，通过光学流判别器和分布匹配正则化器来提升运动真实感，无需奖励模型或人类偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在帧级保真度上表现良好，但在运动连贯性、动态性和真实性方面仍存在问题，如抖动、重影或不合理的动态。标准的去噪MSE目标缺乏对时间一致性的直接监督，导致模型即使损失较低也可能生成不良运动。

Method: 基于3步蒸馏视频扩散模型，训练基于DiT的光学流判别器来区分真实与生成的运动，结合分布匹配正则化器以保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B上的实验显示，MoGAN显著提升了运动质量：在VBench上运动得分比50步教师模型提高+7.3%，比3步DMD模型提高+13.3%；在VideoJAM-Bench上运动得分比教师模型提高+7.4%，比DMD提高+8.8%，同时保持相当或更好的美学和图像质量得分。人类研究也证实MoGAN在运动质量上更受偏好。

Conclusion: MoGAN在不牺牲视觉保真度或效率的情况下，显著提升了运动真实性，为快速高质量视频生成提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

TL;DR: ADVLA是一种针对视觉-语言-动作模型的对抗攻击框架，通过在视觉编码器到文本特征空间的投影上直接施加扰动，实现高效、低幅度且局部稀疏的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要昂贵的端到端训练，且生成的扰动补丁通常很明显。需要一种更高效、更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 直接在视觉编码器投影到文本特征空间的特征上应用对抗扰动，结合注意力引导使扰动集中且稀疏，采用三种策略增强敏感性、强制稀疏性和集中扰动。

Result: 在L∞=4/255约束下，ADVLA结合Top-K掩码修改不到10%的补丁，攻击成功率接近100%。扰动集中在关键区域，整体图像几乎不可察觉，单步迭代仅需约0.06秒。

Conclusion: ADVLA在低幅度和局部稀疏条件下有效削弱VLA模型的下游动作预测，避免了传统补丁攻击的高训练成本和明显扰动，对攻击VLA特征空间具有独特有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

TL;DR: 提出了一个自提示的点监督框架，通过Refine-Requery-Reinforce循环，仅使用稀疏点标注来适应SAM模型到遥感图像分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在自然图像上表现出色，但在遥感图像上由于严重的域偏移和密集标注稀缺而表现欠佳，需要一种仅依赖稀疏点标注的适应方法。

Method: 采用Refine-Requery-Reinforce循环：从初始点生成粗伪掩码（Refine），用自构建的框提示改进（Requery），通过嵌入对齐减少确认偏差（Reinforce）。

Result: 在WHU、HRSID和NWPU VHR-10三个遥感图像基准数据集上，该方法一致超越了预训练SAM和最近的点监督分割方法。

Conclusion: 自提示和语义对齐为遥感应用中基础分割模型的可扩展点级适应提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

Motivation: 解决图卷积网络在骨架动作识别中依赖大量标注数据的问题，实际应用中标注数据往往稀缺。

Method: 1. 开发新颖的采集函数，使用对抗策略选择信息丰富的代表性样本进行标注；2. 引入双向稳定GCN架构，改进环境空间与潜在数据空间之间的映射。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的骨架动作识别基准测试中，相比先前工作取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的标签高效GCN模型能够有效减少对标注数据的依赖，在骨架动作识别任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间智能方面缺乏鲁棒性，主要原因是缺少从2D图像重建3D空间的视觉几何学习过程。

Method: 提出G²VLM模型，利用学习到的3D视觉几何特征直接预测3D属性，并通过上下文学习和交错推理增强空间推理任务。

Result: G²VLM在3D重建任务上达到与最先进前馈模型相当的结果，在空间理解和推理任务上取得更好或具有竞争力的表现。

Conclusion: 通过将语义强大的VLM与低层3D视觉任务统一，G²VLM为社区提供了强大的基线，有望解锁更多未来应用如3D场景编辑。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

TL;DR: CaFlow是一个用于长期动作质量评估的统一框架，结合了反事实去混淆和双向时间条件流，通过因果反事实正则化和双向流模块提升长期时序建模的鲁棒性和表示连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期动作质量评估（如花样滑冰、艺术体操）面临建模长时序动态和抵抗上下文混淆因素的挑战，现有方法依赖昂贵标注或单向时序建模，易受伪相关影响且长期表示不稳定。

Method: 提出CaFlow框架：1）因果反事实正则化模块自监督解耦因果和混淆特征，通过反事实干预增强因果鲁棒性；2）双向流模块建模前向和后向动态，采用循环一致性约束生成更平滑连贯的表示。

Result: 在多个长期AQA基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CaFlow达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CaFlow通过整合反事实去混淆和双向时序建模，有效解决了长期动作质量评估中的时序动态建模和上下文混淆问题，实现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型被广泛用作多模态评估系统的评判者，但它们遵循多样化细粒度评估标准的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 开发了Multi-Crit基准，通过严格的数据筛选流程收集具有多标准人工标注的挑战性响应对，并引入三个新指标系统评估多元标准遵循能力。

Result: 对25个LMMs的综合分析显示：1)专有模型在遵循多元标准方面仍有困难；2)开源模型在灵活遵循多样化标准方面更落后；3)基于整体判断信号的批评微调无法泛化到多元标准级判断。

Conclusion: Multi-Crit为构建可靠和可引导的多模态AI评估奠定了基础，揭示了当前多模态评判者的局限性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

Motivation: 胶质瘤是具有高死亡率的脑肿瘤类型，早期准确诊断对于治疗干预至关重要，需要开发更精确的诊断方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在促进胶质瘤及时可靠诊断和分级方面具有巨大潜力，有助于改善患者治疗规划。

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

Motivation: 现代扩散模型在生成高质量多样化图像方面表现出色，但在同时处理文本提示、主题参考、空间排列、姿态约束和布局注释等多种控制信号时，仍然难以实现高保真的组合和多模态控制。

Method: 提出将多种控制信号编码到单一复合画布图像中，使模型能够直接进行集成视觉空间推理。通过策划多任务数据集和提出多任务画布训练策略，在统一学习范式中优化扩散模型，使其能够联合理解和集成异构控制到文本到图像的生成中。

Result: Canvas-to-Image在身份保持和控制遵循方面显著优于最先进方法，在多人组合、姿态控制组合、布局约束生成和多控制生成等具有挑战性的基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: 联合训练使Canvas-to-Image能够跨多个控制模态进行推理，而不仅仅依赖特定任务的启发式方法，在推理过程中能够很好地泛化到多控制场景。

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

Conclusion: LLM引导的层次结构重构不仅提高了双曲嵌入质量，还实现了可解释的重组，为知识工程师提供了合理性解释。

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 在太阳物理学推理任务中，结构化的工作流分解比简单的直接提示更有效，特别是对于需要演绎推理而非纯归纳回忆的问题。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Abstract: Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对多模态思维链(Multimodal-CoT)在不同领域的泛化能力进行了全面分析，发现在科学推理之外的常识推理任务中效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CoT在科学问答基准上取得了SOTA结果，但其在多样化领域的泛化能力仍待探索，特别是在需要广泛常识和世界知识的任务中。

Method: 采用Zhang等人提出的两阶段框架，将理由生成与答案推理分离，通过门控融合机制将视觉特征与T5语言模型集成，并进行系统性消融研究。

Result: 视觉集成显著减少了理由生成中的幻觉，但CoT推理效果在不同问题类型间差异很大，常识推理尤其具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 为多模态推理系统的实现提供了实用见解，并确定了跨领域泛化中需要改进的关键领域。

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

*Yifan Fan,Le Liang,Peng Liu,Xiao Li,Ziyang Guo,Qiao Lan,Shi Jin,Wen Tong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型代理的智能Wi-Fi框架，使接入点能够通过自然语言对话实时协商自适应协调策略，显著提升了密集重叠基本服务集环境下的网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多接入点协调协议依赖静态的协议定义规则，无法适应动态变化的网络条件（如干扰水平和拓扑结构），需要更智能的自适应解决方案。

Method: 将每个接入点建模为自主的大型语言模型代理，通过认知工作流程进行协作推理和实时协商，利用集成记忆、反思和工具使用功能，基于历史经验和环境反馈做出决策。

Result: 综合仿真结果表明，该代理框架成功适应了各种动态网络环境，显著优于最先进的空分复用基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架验证了作为未来无线网络稳健智能解决方案的潜力，展示了Agentic AI在无线网络协调中的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenApps是一个轻量级开源生态系统，包含6个可配置的应用程序，用于评估多模态UI代理在不同应用变体中的可靠性。研究发现代理在固定应用中的可靠性相对稳定，但在不同应用变体中成功率波动可达50%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法依赖固定环境，无法衡量代理在不同应用设计和内容变体中的可靠性，而实际部署时会遇到各种应用变体影响任务完成能力。

Method: 开发OpenApps生态系统，包含6个可配置应用（消息、日历、地图等），使用单个CPU即可运行，能够生成和部署数千个应用版本，进行了超过10,000次独立评估。

Result: 研究发现标准可靠性在固定应用中相对稳定，但在应用变体中波动剧烈。许多代理的任务成功率在不同应用版本中波动超过50%，例如Kimi-VL-3B的平均成功率从63%降至4%。代理行为如循环或幻觉操作也因环境配置而异。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在应用变体这一新维度上衡量可靠性的重要性。OpenApps为评估UI代理在不同应用环境中的可靠性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

TL;DR: RILKE是一种在表示空间进行干预的知识控制方法，能够在冻结基础权重的情况下实现对复杂非结构化知识的细粒度控制，同时保持模型通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生错误或过时的内容，如何在无需昂贵重新训练的情况下高效准确地更新其知识是一个重大挑战，特别是在终身学习设置中需要处理大量编辑且避免干扰。

Method: RILKE通过在模型表示空间进行干预，学习具有抗释义性和编辑局部性的模块，将每个更新限制在低维子空间以减少跨编辑干扰，推理时通过查询自适应路由器选择合适模块指导生成。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型的知识编辑基准测试中，RILKE可扩展到大规模数据集，表现出高编辑成功率、强释义泛化能力，并以适中的内存开销保持通用能力。

Conclusion: RILKE是LLM中终身知识控制的有效且可扩展的解决方案，能够在复杂知识编辑场景中实现细粒度控制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架为组合解释提供了理论保证的最优性，揭示了现有方法的局限性，并提供了更灵活高效的替代方案。

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

TL;DR: ENACT是一个评估视觉语言模型是否具有具身认知能力的基准测试，通过视觉问答形式测试模型从自我中心交互中进行世界建模的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代视觉语言模型是否在非具身训练中表现出具身认知的特征，即智能是否源于感知运动交互而非被动观察。

Method: 将具身认知评估构建为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程，包含两个序列重排序任务：前向世界建模（给定动作重排观察序列）和逆向世界建模（给定观察重排动作序列）。

Result: 前沿视觉语言模型与人类存在性能差距，且差距随交互时间跨度增大而扩大；模型在逆向任务上表现更好，并表现出人类中心偏见（如偏好右手动作）。

Conclusion: 现代视觉语言模型确实显示出一些具身认知特征，但与人类相比仍有显著差距，特别是在长时程交互和视角变化方面。

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在程序性技能学习中，教学解释需要传达步骤背后的因果、目标导向和组合逻辑，而大型语言模型通常只能生成流畅但浅层的回答，缺乏这种结构。

Method: Ivy系统将符号化的任务-方法-知识(TMK)模型与生成式解释层相结合，TMK编码因果转换、目标层次和问题分解，并在明确的结构边界内指导LLM构建解释。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了一种可扩展的AI教育方法，通过符号约束增强了AI生成解释在教学教练系统中的教育价值。

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在奖励粒度粗、奖励噪声大和探索效率低等问题，导致训练不稳定和熵崩溃，限制了推理能力的提升。

Method: ICPO方法利用LLM生成不同响应的概率来反映其对推理过程的自我评估，通过比较同一输入提示下多个响应的相对生成概率计算偏好优势分数，并将其与可验证奖励结合来指导探索过程。

Result: 在四个通用领域基准和三个数学基准上的综合实验表明，ICPO相比GRPO能够稳定提升推理能力。

Conclusion: ICPO方法通过偏好优势分数有效缓解了奖励粒度和噪声问题，抑制过度自信错误，增强被低估高质量响应的相对优势，防止模型对特定策略过拟合，促进更彻底的探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

TL;DR: L4M框架结合对抗性LLM代理和SMT求解器验证，将自然语言解释的灵活性与符号验证的严谨性相结合，在司法推理中超越现有LLM和Legal AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM系统擅长表层文本分析，但缺乏原则性法理学所需的保证。法律理性包括实质理性（结果公平性）和形式理性（遵循明确规则），需要将自然语言灵活性与符号验证严谨性相结合。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 法规形式化：将法律条款转换为逻辑公式；2) 双事实和法规提取：检察官和辩护方对齐的LLM独立映射案件叙述；3) 求解器中心裁决：将双方论证编译为逻辑约束，通过不满足核心触发迭代自我批评，最终由法官LLM生成透明判决。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，该系统超越了GPT-4-mini、DeepSeek-V3、Claude 4等先进LLM以及最先进的Legal AI基线，同时提供严谨且可解释的符号论证。

Conclusion: L4M成功将自然语言解释的灵活性与符号验证的严谨性相结合，为司法推理提供了超越现有方法的性能和可解释性保证。

Abstract: The rationality of law manifests in two forms: substantive rationality, which concerns the fairness or moral desirability of outcomes, and formal rationality, which requires legal decisions to follow explicitly stated, general, and logically coherent rules. Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OVOD方法虽然在多模态数据上预训练，但推理仍局限于固定类别名称，造成多模态训练与单模态推理之间的差距。文本空间的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出OVOD-Agent框架，采用Visual-CoT进行可解释的视觉推理，将视觉上下文建模为弱马尔可夫决策过程(w-MDP)，使用Bandit模块生成探索信号，并结合马尔可夫转移矩阵进行自监督奖励模型优化。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS数据集上的实验表明，OVOD-Agent在多种OVOD骨干网络上均能提供一致改进，特别是在稀有类别上表现突出。

Conclusion: OVOD-Agent通过主动推理和自我进化检测机制，有效提升了开放词汇目标检测的性能，证明了所提框架的有效性。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: 抽象化方法不仅扩展了因果定义的适用范围，还深化了对因果定义特征的理解，为因果推理提供了更通用的理论框架。

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

### [135] [Prune4Web: DOM Tree Pruning Programming for Web Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21398)
*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web是一种新颖的网页自动化方法，通过将DOM处理从资源密集的LLM阅读转变为高效的程序化修剪，解决了复杂网页DOM结构过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的网页代理在处理包含10,000到100,000个token的大型DOM结构时效率低下，现有策略要么依赖粗糙的DOM截断（可能丢失关键信息），要么使用低效的启发式方法和单独排名模型，无法在精度和可扩展性之间达到最佳平衡。

Method: 提出DOM树修剪编程方法，让LLM生成可执行的Python评分脚本，基于分解的子任务语义线索动态过滤DOM元素。该方法将遍历和评分委托给轻量级、可解释的程序，而不是让LLM直接处理原始的大型DOM。

Result: 实现了候选元素25倍到50倍的减少，在低级别定位任务中准确率从46.8%大幅提升至88.28%，表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Prune4Web通过程序化修剪DOM的方法，在保持精度的同时显著提高了网页自动化的可扩展性和效率，为真实世界的网页自动化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物重定位预测需要多领域专家协作，现有工具碎片化且数据异构，难以集成到统一工作流中。ChatDRex旨在解决这些问题，使临床专家无需计算机专业知识也能进行复杂分析。

Method: 基于NeDRex知识图谱构建多智能体系统，包含查询路由、数据检索、算法执行、结果可视化等专门智能体，集成网络分析、药物重定位、功能一致性评估、文献挖掘等功能模块。

Conclusion: ChatDRex通过多智能体系统和自然语言界面，使临床专家能够生成假设并探索药物重定位机会，加速新疗法发现，推动个性化医疗和转化研究。

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

TL;DR: 提出MADRA框架，通过多智能体辩论进行风险评估，无需训练即可提升安全感知能力，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在具身AI任务规划中的安全风险问题，现有方法要么计算成本高，要么过度拒绝安全指令。

Method: 使用基于LLM的多智能体辩论框架，包含关键评估器对响应进行评分，通过迭代审议和共识投票机制。

Result: 在AI2-THOR和VirtualHome上的实验显示，超过90%的不安全任务被拒绝，同时安全任务拒绝率低，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可扩展、模型无关的解决方案，用于构建可信赖的具身智能体。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一个分层空间认知框架，将空间智能分解为5个渐进复杂层次，并构建了SpatialBench基准来系统评估多模态大语言模型的空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准过度简化空间认知，将其简化为单一维度指标，无法捕捉空间能力的层次结构和相互依赖性。

Method: 提出了分层空间认知框架，将空间智能分解为5个认知层次；构建了包含15个任务的大规模细粒度基准SpatialBench；引入了面向能力的高层度量标准。

Result: 实验发现模型在不同认知层次上表现分层：感知基础能力强，但在符号推理、因果推理和规划方面仍有局限；人类测试显示人类进行选择性、目标导向的抽象，而MLLMs倾向于过度关注表面细节。

Conclusion: 建立了首个系统化测量MLLMs分层空间认知的框架，为未来空间智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

TL;DR: 提出悲观验证方法，通过构建多个并行验证来检测数学证明中的错误，显著提升验证性能且计算资源消耗低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证性能的关键限制在于错误检测能力，需要更有效的验证方法来提高数学问题的可靠性。

Method: 设计悲观验证变体，为同一证明构建多个并行验证，只要任一验证报告错误就判定证明不正确。

Result: 该方法在多个数学验证基准上显著提升性能，计算资源消耗低，token效率甚至超过扩展长链思维。

Conclusion: 悲观验证能有效提高语言模型输出的可靠性，对实现长视野数学任务至关重要，有助于增强语言模型的数学能力。

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 语言模型在专业领域无法可靠披露AI身份，导致用户无法信任其能力边界。研究发现模型在专业角色扮演中表现出显著的领域特异性不一致，某些模型的有意推理优化反而抑制了自我透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业高风险领域，如果语言模型不能可靠地披露其AI身份，用户可能会错误地信任其能力边界，从而面临潜在危害。需要评估模型在专业角色扮演中的自我透明度表现。

Method: 采用通用环境设计，对16个开源模型（4B-671B参数）进行19,200次试验审计，评估不同专业角色下的身份披露行为，并使用贝叶斯验证和Rogan-Gladen校正确保结果稳健性。

Result: 模型表现出显著的领域特异性不一致：金融顾问角色初始披露率为30.8%，而神经外科医生角色仅为3.5%。披露率范围从2.8%到73.6%，模型身份比参数数量更能预测行为。推理优化在某些模型中主动抑制了自我透明度，推理变体的披露率比基础版本低达48.4%。

Conclusion: 透明度反映了训练因素而非规模大小，组织不能假设安全属性会转移到部署环境中，需要刻意设计行为和进行实证验证。

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

Motivation: 在技术快速发展和全球挑战日益复杂的时代，需要建立负责任的预见框架来帮助政策制定者应对未来不确定性，塑造可持续的未来。

Method: 建立负责任计算预见的基本原则，开发AI驱动的预见工具，结合模拟和情景分析来增强政策制定者的决策能力。

Conclusion: AI应作为负责任、以人为本的预见支持工具，补充而非替代政策制定者的判断，帮助塑造有韧性和道德健全的未来。

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在没有代码执行等工具的情况下，进行规划和状态推理的实际能力，通过经典的8拼图任务进行精确评估。

Method: 测试四种模型在零样本、思维链、算法思维等提示条件下，使用分层纠正反馈和外部移动验证器来评估模型表现。

Result: 反馈能提高某些模型-提示组合的成功率，但成功运行通常冗长且计算昂贵。即使有移动验证器辅助，所有模型都无法解决任何拼图。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在规划方面存在显著局限，需要开发维护显式状态和执行结构化搜索的机制才能取得进一步进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on many benchmarks, yet their capacity for planning and stateful reasoning remains unclear. We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推进负责任AI/ML的发展，通过整合不同方法论来更好地理解和解决AI系统中的偏见问题。

Abstract: AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's "the unavoidable a priori"). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.

Motivation: 现有基于轨迹的记忆方法存在简洁性偏差，逐渐丢失重要领域知识，且仅记录单模态行为轨迹，无法保留视觉注意力和逻辑推理如何共同贡献于解决方案，这与人类的多模态整合语义记忆不符。

Method: 采用双流记忆框架，分别编码视觉分心模式和逻辑推理错误，遵循增长-精炼原则，增量积累和更新多模态语义知识，保持稳定可泛化策略同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 错误感知的多模态记忆对于终身和跨领域代理学习具有重要价值，ViLoMem框架有效提升了多模态推理性能。

Abstract: MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning. Our project page will be available at https://weihao-bo.github.io/ViLoMeo-page.

Motivation: 传统基于固定分辨率体素网格或八叉树的体积方法存在内存效率低、计算开销大且缺乏GPU支持的问题，特别是在实时和资源受限场景下。

Method: 使用方差自适应的多分辨率体素网格，根据有符号距离场观测的局部方差动态调整体素大小，采用扁平空间哈希表存储所有体素块，支持恒定时间访问和完全GPU并行化。

Result: 开源CUDA/C++实现相比固定分辨率基线实现高达13倍加速和4倍内存使用降低，在重建精度方面保持同等水平。

Conclusion: 该方法为高性能3D重建提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，支持GPU加速渲染和实时可扩展性。

Abstract: Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出ProNECL框架，通过原型引导的非示例持续学习解决跨个体EEG解码中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需存储历史EEG数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于EEG信号在个体间存在显著变异性，在持续EEG解码任务中引入新受试者时会覆盖先前学到的知识。现有方法依赖存储历史数据作为回放缓冲区，但存在隐私和内存限制问题。

Method: 构建类级别原型来总结每个受试者的判别性表示，通过跨受试者特征对齐和知识蒸馏增量对齐新特征空间与全局原型记忆。

Result: 在BCI Competition IV 2a和2b数据集上验证，框架有效平衡知识保留和适应性，在跨受试者持续EEG解码任务中实现优异性能。

Conclusion: ProNECL框架无需访问历史EEG样本即可保留先验知识，为持续EEG解码提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation. Validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的注意力机制——现代Hopfield注意力（MHA），通过在自注意力中添加来自现代Hopfield网络的隐藏状态变量，建立了Hopfield网络与Transformer之间更广义的对应关系，有效解决了深度Transformer的秩崩溃和token均匀性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越现代Hopfield网络（MHN）的绝热近似，深入探究MHN与自注意力机制之间的关系，寻求改进Transformer架构的新视角。

Method: 在现代Hopfield网络的基础上，通过引入隐藏状态变量，构建了现代Hopfield注意力（MHA）机制，使注意力分数能够从Transformer的输入层继承到输出层。

Result: 理论和实验证明MHA隐藏状态显著改善了深度Transformer的秩崩溃和token均匀性问题，在Vision Transformer和GPT上无需增加训练参数即可系统性地提高准确率。

Conclusion: Hopfield网络为改进Transformer架构提供了有用的新视角，MHA机制展示了这种对应关系的实际价值。

Abstract: Associative memory models based on Hopfield networks and self-attention based on key-value mechanisms have been popular approaches in the study of memory mechanisms in deep learning. It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture.

*Chinmay Tripurwar,Utkarsh Maurya,Dishant*

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需数据的知识蒸馏框架，通过使用DeepInversion合成隐私保护的“梦境”图像来恢复剪枝后的模型精度，无需访问原始训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在隐私敏感领域（如医疗、金融），模型剪枝后通常需要原始训练数据进行微调，但由于法规限制（GDPR、HIPAA），部署后往往无法访问原始数据。

Method: 使用DeepInversion通过反转批归一化统计量从预训练教师模型中合成隐私保护的图像，这些合成图像作为传输集，将知识从原始教师模型蒸馏到剪枝后的学生网络。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上对多种架构（ResNet、MobileNet、VGG）的实验结果表明，该方法显著恢复了剪枝过程中损失的精度，且无需访问任何真实数据点。

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥合了模型压缩与数据隐私之间的差距，为隐私敏感场景下的模型优化提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Model pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, global unstructured pruning often leads to significant degradation in accuracy, typically necessitating fine-tuning on the original training dataset to recover performance. In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point.

Conclusion: 基于扩散的合成预训练与图Transformer结合可以改善低样本、不平衡临床预测环境中的泛化性能

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.

Method: 基于重启采样的思想，使用适用于任意可微测量模型的条件ODE，引入简化重启策略来收缩采样过程中的累积近似误差

Result: RePS在多种逆问题中相比现有基线方法收敛更快、重建质量更优

Conclusion: RePS为使用预训练扩散模型解决逆问题提供了一种通用且高效的框架

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.
  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.
  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在特定数据子集上存在系统错误，手动识别这些错误切片需要大量标注工作，因此需要开发更高效的切片发现方法。

Method: 使用基于不确定性的主动学习算法，结合不同的特征表示，通过有限的人工验证来发现共享相同错误模式的样本组。

Result: 在多个切片上，基于不确定性的主动学习算法表现最佳，仅使用2-10%的切片成员信息就能达到竞争性准确率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 主动切片发现是识别模型系统错误的有效方法，基于不确定性的主动学习算法在减少标注需求的同时保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了两种稳定多轮对话中PPO训练的技术：轮级重要性采样和裁剪偏差校正，解决了PPO在LLM训练中的不稳定性问题


<details>

Motivation: PPO在多轮对话和推理任务中训练LLM时性能不稳定且容易崩溃，主要问题在于：(1) 令牌级重要性采样与多轮环境的自然粒度不匹配；(2) 离策略样本导致优势估计不准确

Conclusion: 轮级重要性采样与裁剪偏差校正相结合，为稳定多轮LLM智能体训练提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces critical challenges in rare long-tail events and complex multi-agent interactions, which are scarce in real-world data yet essential for robust safety validation. This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods. These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events.

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.

Abstract: We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.

Method: 分析神经网络在随机初始化后的预测分布特征，研究不同损失函数（包括Blurry和Piecewise-zero损失）在存在初始猜测偏差时的训练动态。

Result: 发现初始猜测偏差会导致模型偏向少数类别，损失函数选择对早期训练动态有显著影响，某些损失函数在存在偏差时可能无法有效引导训练方向。

Conclusion: 损失函数选择对神经网络早期训练至关重要，需要考虑初始猜测偏差与训练方案各组成部分的相互作用。

Abstract: Untrained large neural networks, just after random initialization, tend to favour a small subset of classes, assigning high predicted probabilities to these few classes and approximately zero probability to all others. This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme.

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

Conclusion: Primal框架提供了确定性、可调谐的特征映射方法，在信号重建、压缩感知、超维计算和隐私保护分割学习等应用中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络在噪声标签下训练会导致过拟合和泛化能力下降，现有方法通常需要干净标签子集，而自监督预训练可以提供无标签的鲁棒特征表示。

Method: 采用SimCLR和Barlow Twins自监督学习方法预训练特征提取器，然后在噪声数据集上进行标准监督训练，在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上评估合成和真实噪声。

Result: 自监督预训练在所有噪声率下都提高了分类准确率和标签错误检测性能，噪声率越高性能提升越明显，在高噪声条件下显著优于ImageNet预训练模型。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练是处理噪声标签的有效方法，无需干净标签子集，在高噪声环境下表现优异，为噪声标签学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了模拟器中状态重置的基本能力，特别是当模拟器包含潜在变量时，状态重置需要从给定可观测历史的潜在状态后验分布中采样。论文提出了两种不同的信念状态选择公式，并分析了它们与下游展开方法的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态重置是模拟器的基本能力，但在复杂模拟器中实现状态重置可能很困难，特别是当模拟器包含潜在变量时。现有的近似信念状态采样器很多，但如何仅使用采样访问来选择它们是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 将问题简化为一般的条件分布选择任务，开发了新算法和分析方法。提出了两种信念状态选择公式：基于潜在状态的选择和基于观测的选择，并分析了它们与两种展开方法（单次重置和重复重置）的相互作用。

Result: 发现基于观测的选择在自然展开方法（单次重置）下可能失败，但在较少常规的替代方法（重复重置）下具有保证。揭示了算法选择、理论细微差别和开放问题的丰富图景。

Conclusion: 状态重置这个看似简单的问题实际上涉及复杂的算法选择、理论细微差别和未解决的问题。论文为模拟器中的信念状态选择提供了理论基础和分析框架。

Abstract: State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.
  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.

### [166] [Representation Integrity in Temporal Graph Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20873)
*Elahe Kooshafar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估动态图表示学习模型表示完整性的框架，通过三个合成场景测试了42个候选指标，推荐了一个经验证的有效指标，并比较了常见模型的表示完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试仅通过任务特定分数评估动态图学习器，很少关注嵌入本身是否能真实反映网络演化，因此需要评估表示完整性。

Method: 定义了表示完整性的概念，设计了三个合成场景（渐进合并、突然移动、周期性重连）来筛选42个候选指标，推荐了一个经验证的指标，并用该指标比较常见动态图学习模型。

Result: 推荐的指标在所有理论和实证测试中表现良好，能一致地将可证明稳定的UASE和IPP模型排名最高，并与一步链接预测AUC呈强正相关。

Conclusion: 提出的完整性框架为动态图表示质量提供了任务无关且可解释的评估工具，为模型选择和未来架构设计提供更明确的指导。

Abstract: Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.

TL;DR: 提出概率哈希嵌入(PHE)模型解决在线学习中分类特征词汇表变化时确定性嵌入的遗忘问题，通过贝叶斯在线学习实现自适应且内存高效的嵌入学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习场景中，分类特征词汇表不断变化且可能无限增长，传统确定性哈希嵌入对类别到达顺序敏感且存在遗忘问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出概率哈希嵌入(PHE)模型，将哈希嵌入视为随机变量，应用贝叶斯在线学习从数据中增量学习。开发可扩展推理算法学习模型参数并推断/更新哈希嵌入和其他潜变量的后验分布。

Result: 在分类、序列建模和推荐系统的在线学习实验中，PHE表现出优越性能，同时保持高内存效率(仅消耗one-hot嵌入表2~4%的内存)。

Conclusion: PHE模型能处理不断演化的分类词汇表，自适应新项目而不遗忘旧项目，参数数量有界且不随流中不同值数量增长，对项目到达顺序不敏感。

Abstract: We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较三种数据重加权方法（遗传算法、基于数据集特征、等权重）在机器学习模型中的公平性和预测性能权衡效果，发现遗传算法优化的权重能在多数数据集上获得更好的公平性-性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在真实世界数据上训练时可能产生有偏预测，对边缘化群体产生负面影响。重加权方法通过为训练数据点分配权重来缓解这种偏见。

Method: 比较三种权重生成方法：1) 使用遗传算法演化权重；2) 仅基于数据集特征计算权重；3) 对所有数据点分配相等权重。使用预测指标（准确率、AUC）和公平性指标（人口统计均等差异、子组假阴性公平性）评估模型性能。

Result: 在11个公开数据集上的实验表明，演化得到的样本权重能够产生在公平性和预测性能之间实现更好权衡的模型。优化准确率和人口统计均等差异指标时，演化权重在最多数据集上显著优于其他加权策略。

Conclusion: 演化样本权重可以产生比替代加权方法更好的公平性-性能权衡，但这些优势的大小强烈依赖于优化目标的选择。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究比较了脓毒症管理中四种不同时间步长（1、2、4、8小时）对离线强化学习性能的影响，发现较细的时间步长（1-2小时）能获得更好的性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脓毒症管理强化学习研究多采用4小时时间步长，但该粒度可能扭曲患者动态并导致次优治疗策略，需要量化时间步长对学习性能的实际影响。

Method: 采用相同的离线RL流程，设计动作重映射方法以公平比较不同时间步长，在两种策略学习设置下进行跨时间步长的模型选择，评估时间步长对状态表示学习、行为克隆、策略训练和离策略评估的影响。

Result: 不同时间步长的性能趋势随学习设置变化，使用静态行为策略在较细时间步长（1-2小时）学习的策略获得最佳整体性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: 时间步长是医疗保健离线RL的核心设计选择，研究结果支持超越传统4小时设置的替代方案。

Abstract: Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.

Motivation: 现有理论表明量化因子在任意微分同胚下具有无监督可识别性，但将这一理论原理转化为有效的实践标准仍然具有挑战性，特别是在非线性映射下。

Method: 开发了一种鼓励轴对齐不连续性的无监督解缠准则，这些不连续性表现为因子估计密度的急剧变化（称为cliffs），并鼓励沿某一因子的cliffs位置与其他因子的值独立。

Result: Cliff方法在所有解缠基准测试中都优于基线方法，证明了其在无监督解缠中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过鼓励轴对齐不连续性，Cliff方法成功地将理论原理转化为实用的无监督解缠标准，并在各种基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了两种BEC检测方法：基于心理语言学的CatBoost方法（高可解释性、低延迟）和基于深度学习的DistilBERT方法（高精度、高计算成本）。两种方法在对抗性数据集上都表现出色，通过成本敏感学习可实现超过99.96%的投资回报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEC是一种利用组织层级和心理漏洞的社会工程威胁，造成巨大经济损失。根据FBI报告，BEC每年造成超过29亿美元损失，存在显著的经济不对称性：漏报成本（欺诈损失）远高于误报成本（人工审核）。

Method: 提出两种检测范式：1）法证心理语言学流：使用CatBoost分析心理语言线索，具有高可解释性和低延迟；2）语义流：使用DistilBERT进行深度学习上下文理解，精度更高但计算成本更高。在对抗性数据集上评估两种方法。

Result: DistilBERT在对抗性数据集上实现卓越检测（AUC=1.0000，F1=0.9981），实时延迟7.403毫秒；CatBoost实现竞争性检测（AUC=0.9905，F1=0.9486），延迟降低8.4倍（0.885毫秒），计算资源消耗可忽略。

Conclusion: 对于拥有GPU基础设施的组织，DistilBERT提供更优精度；对于边缘部署或成本敏感环境，CatBoost因可比较的安全性和更低的运营成本更可取。两种方法通过成本敏感学习优化，投资回报率均超过99.96%。

Abstract: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).
  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了迫切需要更多关于行为克隆策略鲁棒性的研究，特别是在使用大规模数据集训练现实世界网络物理系统策略时。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Motivation: 现有LLM在强化学习中的高层次规划能力受限于规划-执行不对齐问题，表现为子目标语义合理但环境不可行，以及单LLM规划中生成与验证混淆导致不可靠子目标。

Method: SGA-ACR框架集成环境特定子目标图和结构化实体知识，采用多LLM规划管道明确分离生成、批判和精炼过程，并引入子目标跟踪器监控执行进度和自适应更新子目标图。

Result: 在开放世界游戏"Crafter"的22个多样化任务上实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SGA-ACR通过结构化规划和执行监控机制有效解决了LLM在强化学习中的规划-执行对齐问题，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Conclusion: FANoise通过特征自适应噪声注入有效平衡了噪声的负面影响与益处，为表示学习提供了理论支撑的改进框架。

Abstract: Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.

Motivation: 尽管Ising模型的统计复杂性已被理解，但在总变差距离下寻找计算和统计效率兼备的估计算法仍然具有挑战性。现有研究仅针对特定情况（如树结构、高斯分布交互矩阵等），缺乏统一的框架。

Method: 使用最大伪似然估计器(MPLE)，对两类一般Ising模型进行统一分析：第一类具有有界算子范数且满足修正对数索博列夫不等式(MLSI)；第二类具有有界无穷范数（有界宽度）。

Result: 为这两类模型提供了多项式时间算法，并在多种设置下获得了最优或接近最优的样本复杂度保证。

Conclusion: 该研究为Ising模型的总变差距离估计提供了一个统一的框架，填补了现有研究的空白，并为更广泛的模型类别提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.

Abstract: The challenge of separating AI-generated text from human-authored content is becoming more urgent as generative AI technologies like ChatGPT become more widely available. In this work, we address this issue by looking at both the detection of content that has been entirely generated by AI and the identification of human text that has been reworded by AI. In our work, a comprehensive methodology to detect AI- generated text using XLM-RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art multilingual transformer model. Our approach includes rigorous preprocessing, and feature extraction involving perplexity, semantic, and readability features. We fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model on a balanced dataset of human and AI-generated texts and evaluated its performance. The model demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance across various text genres. Additionally, we conducted feature analysis to understand the model's decision-making process, revealing that perplexity and attention-based features are critical in differentiating between human and AI-generated texts. Our findings offer a valuable tool for maintaining academic integrity and contribute to the broader field of AI ethics by promoting transparency and accountability in AI systems. Future research directions include exploring other advanced models and expanding the dataset to enhance the model's generalizability.

Abstract: Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.

Conclusion: GKA成功地在保持SSM效率的同时，通过创新的数值稳定技术和硬件优化，显著提升了模型对历史信息的利用能力，在长短上下文任务中都表现出色。

Abstract: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

Conclusion: ELBO_TDS框架能有效解决推荐系统中的时间分布偏移问题，提升模型的长期准确性

Abstract: Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

Conclusion: FedAPA有效解决了Wi-Fi CSI感知中的联邦学习挑战，在保持隐私的同时显著提升了感知性能和通信效率。

Abstract: Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.

Motivation: 传统LLM微调方法（SFT和RLHF）存在安全性与能力的权衡问题，提升任务性能会降低安全对齐性。RLVR作为有前景的替代方法，其安全性影响尚未被探索。

Method: 通过理论分析推导KL约束优化下的安全漂移上界，并进行大量实证实验，在五个对抗性安全基准上测试RLVR的性能，同时进行消融研究分析优化算法、模型规模和任务领域的影响。

Result: 理论证明在特定条件下可以消除安全性退化，实证结果显示RLVR能同时增强推理能力并保持或改进安全防护，挑战了安全能力权衡的普遍假设。

Conclusion: RLVR训练方法可以同时实现安全性和能力目标，为安全部署具备推理能力的LLMs提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

Conclusion: TDP通过时间维度分布去噪步骤和渐进式计划更新，显著提高了扩散规划的决策效率，为高效离线强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy. This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models. G-Nets are a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening a new direction for constructing robust binary/quantized deep learning models.

Motivation: 当前方法在生物医学领域存在局限：SFT容易过拟合表面指令模式而无法内化碎片化科学知识；RL需要实验验证奖励信号，在生物医学领域不实用。

Conclusion: BFT促进了LLMs在生物医学研究中的广泛应用，能够从稀疏数据中有效学习复杂推理机制。

Abstract: Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.

Conclusion: Deceptron方法通过局部逆学习和Jacobian组合惩罚有效改善了病态逆问题的求解效率，展示了在复杂问题上的快速收敛能力。

Abstract: Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型作为稠密Transformer部署，计算效率低下，因为推理成本随参数数量线性增长。现有方法依赖聚类、激活分析等复杂技术，需要校准数据。

Method: 使用张量切片和求和的代数方法，将张量并行性重新解释为拓扑转换；引入分形衰减和补偿剪枝实现结构化稀疏性。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-0.5B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B上，零样本转换使代理困惑度变化小于0.05%，参数数量基本不变；8B模型上，差分稀疏性移除约20%MLP参数，困惑度保持在稠密基线约2%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法完全在现有检查点上后处理运行，无需梯度、校准集或路由训练，提供了一种高效的结构化稀疏解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

Abstract: Various neuroimaging studies suffer from small sample size problem which often limit their reliability. Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.

Conclusion: 这是首次在如此大规模下成功在早期排序阶段部署完整的目标感知注意力序列建模，有效平衡了推荐系统的效果与效率

Abstract: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了扩散语言模型解码策略的瓶颈，提出高置信度token优先策略存在信息理论瓶颈，并提出了Explore-Then-Exploit解码策略来提升解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DLM解码策略依赖高置信度token，但面临信息理论瓶颈，限制了解码进度并减慢了生成速度。高概率token携带的信息量很少，严格依赖它们会限制每轮解码的有效进展。

Method: 提出了Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE)解码策略，该策略结合跨块解码和针对高不确定性token的探索，以重塑条件分布并触发自信预测的级联效应。

Result: 实验验证了理论界限，表明ETE相比仅依赖置信度的基线方法，在不影响生成质量的情况下持续减少了所需的解码轮数。

Conclusion: 证明了解码轮数必须与样本总信息量线性增长，与每轮信息预算成反比，建立了比特到轮数的原则。ETE策略有效提升了信息吞吐量和解码效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种结构化提示方法，用于可扩展的验证程序生成，通过将验证分解为代码、规范和证明三个相互关联的领域，显著提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现优异，但在程序验证（特别是在Lean4等交互式证明框架中）方面存在困难。主要挑战是可扩展性：验证合成不仅需要代码，还需要精确的规范和正确性证明，而现有方法很少能同时涵盖这三个领域。

Method: BRIDGE将验证分解为三个相互关联的领域：代码（可执行实现）、规范（形式化意图陈述）和证明（构造性正确性论证）。该方法通过引出不同的推理行为（功能性、规范驱动和证明导向）作为中间表示，保持语义结构并连接这些领域。

Result: 功能性推理将形式语言（Lean4）中代码的正确性提高了近1.5倍（pass@5），推理时间计算效率提高了2倍，用更少的生成和更低的采样预算实现了更高的通过率。规范驱动提示将Python编码通过率提高了17.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化领域对齐是推进验证合成的有前景方向。BRIDGE为通过专家迭代或RLVR进行训练奠定了基础，使模型能够内化代码、规范和证明之间的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

Motivation: 现有神经学习方法在处理MILP分支时面临语义变化、上游节点稀缺和强分支样本收集成本高等挑战。

Conclusion: 所提出的动态分层对比训练框架能够有效建模节点间的细微语义差异，特别是在上游节点方面显著提升了分支性能和求解效率。

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

Abstract: Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注化学结构本身，但细胞响应（如形态和基因表达）对药物效应具有关键影响。当前细胞感知方法面临两个主要限制：外部生物数据的模态不完整性，以及跨分子、细胞和基因组层次依赖关系建模不足。

Method: 提出CHMR框架，联合建模分子与细胞响应的局部-全局依赖关系，通过新颖的树结构向量量化模块捕捉潜在生物层次结构，实现层次感知的多模态学习。

Conclusion: 结果表明层次感知的多模态学习能够提供更可靠且生物学基础更扎实的分子表示，为整合生物医学建模提供了一个通用框架。

Abstract: Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

Conclusion: 该框架解决了LLM评估中的偏差问题，提供了统计上健全的评估方法，并通过自适应采样优化了校准效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.

Our approach achieves a 30 times speed-up over the standard baseline while also enhancing the quality of the generated sequences for classification tasks.

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated unparalleled sampling quality and diversity in numerous fields, such as image generation, voice synthesis, and tabular data synthesis, etc. Inspired by those outstanding results, we apply SGMs to synthesize time-series by learning its conditional score function. To this end, we present a conditional score network for time-series synthesis, deriving a denoising score matching loss tailored for our purposes. In particular, our presented denoising score matching loss is the conditional denoising score matching loss for time-series synthesis. In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.

Motivation: 探究掩码扩散语言模型在上下文理解能力方面的实际表现，验证其是否真正实现了比自回归模型更均匀的上下文利用

Method: 通过系统消融实验分析MDLMs的上下文理解能力，识别位置偏见和掩码干扰问题，并提出掩码无关损失函数进行微调

Result: 发现MDLMs存在强烈的位置偏见，性能对相关信息在输入中的位置高度敏感；大量掩码标记会显著降低上下文理解能力，这些掩码充当了干扰因素

Conclusion: 当前MDLM训练范式存在关键局限性，掩码无关损失函数能有效减轻掩码的干扰效应，为构建具有更强上下文理解能力的基于扩散的语言模型提供了可行方案

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性逆强化学习(AIRL)在稀疏奖励的强化学习问题中表现良好，但在高度复杂的不完全信息环境(如扑克游戏)中的性能尚未充分探索。

Method: H-AIRL扩展了AIRL，通过引入专家数据的监督损失和随机正则化机制来增强奖励推断和策略学习。

Result: 在Gymnasium基准测试和HULHE扑克环境中，H-AIRL相比AIRL实现了更高的样本效率和更稳定的学习过程。

Conclusion: 将监督信号融入逆强化学习具有显著优势，H-AIRL为处理具有挑战性的现实世界问题提供了一个有前景的框架。

Abstract: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域，需要能忠实反映模型决策过程的解释方法。现有保真度指标如Infidelity依赖蒙特卡洛近似，需要大量模型评估且引入随机性不确定性

Method: 通过在引导扰动实验中修改现有的Prediction Change (PC)指标，结合扰动和归因的方向，提出DPC指标

Result: 在两个数据集（皮肤病变图像和金融表格数据）、两个黑盒模型、七种解释算法和广泛超参数范围内评估了4744个不同解释，DPC与PC一起实现了对基线导向和局部特征归因方法的全面高效评估

Conclusion: DPC提供了确定性、可重复的评估过程，与局部Infidelity测量相同属性，但速度更快且无随机性

Abstract: The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

Abstract: Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出通过为查询和键权重分配参数相关学习率来控制logits变化，解决transformer模型训练中的稳定性问题，特别是在无法应用QK归一化的MLA场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: transformer模型中查询和键权重容易无限制增长导致稳定性问题。QK归一化虽能解决但无法应用于MLA等多潜在注意力机制，因为这些机制在推理时不完整物化查询和键。

Method: 通过为查询和键权重分配参数依赖的学习率来控制logits变化，这是一种廉价干预方法。

Result: 该方法允许提高网络的基础学习率，在MLA设置中优于其他方法，在使用多头注意力时性能与QK归一化相当。

Conclusion: 控制logits变化是稳定transformer训练的关键，参数相关学习率策略是QK归一化的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.

Motivation: 传统异常检测模型假设训练数据完全正常，但实际数据往往包含污染。现有方法依赖固定污染比例假设，当假设与实际不符时性能严重下降，特别是在正常与异常数据分布重叠的噪声环境中。

Method: AAR方法结合改进的z-score和高斯混合模型阈值，动态排除异常数据。通过整合硬拒绝和软拒绝策略，平衡保留正常数据与排除异常数据之间的权衡。

Result: 在两个图像数据集和三十个表格数据集上的广泛实验表明，AAR比最先进方法提升了0.041 AUROC。

Conclusion: AAR为污染数据集提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，增强了鲁棒性，为安全和医疗等领域的实际应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer架构的刚性、统一计算分配限制了效率和可扩展性，特别是在大规模模型和长序列处理中。

Method: SDT在解码器堆栈中交替使用决策层和动态层，基于贝叶斯惊喜信号进行Top-K路由；STT将条件计算扩展到时间域，通过过渡网络预测残差更新来动态执行或绕过Transformer块。

Result: 两种架构在训练过程中都表现出从新颖性驱动到预测驱动的门控转变，与基于惊喜的原则保持一致，尽管在降低容量下运行，但为条件计算的计算-精度权衡提供了初步见解。

Conclusion: 所提出的架构建立了一个灵活的效率框架，为更高效的模型设定了路径。

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

TL;DR: 提出浅层通用多项式网络(SUPNs)，用单层可学习系数的多项式替代除最后一层外的所有隐藏层，在保持表达力的同时大幅减少参数数量，相比DNNs和KANs在相同参数数量下近似误差和变异性降低一个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs和KANs通常需要大量可训练参数来获得合适的函数近似，这导致网络不透明、优化空间大且容易陷入泛化误差差异大的局部最小值，网络初始化对模型性能影响过大。

Method: 提出SUPNs架构，将除最后一层外的所有隐藏层替换为单层可学习系数的多项式，结合DNNs和多项式的优势，在保持足够表达力的同时显著减少参数数量。

Result: 在1维、2维和10维的超过13,000个模型实验中，对于相同参数数量，SUPNs的近似误差和变异性通常比DNNs和KANs低一个数量级，甚至在非光滑函数上优于多项式投影方法。

Conclusion: SUPNs通过多项式结构在保持表达力的同时大幅减少参数数量，提供更稳定和准确的函数近似，收敛速度与最佳多项式近似相同，且能推导出准最优参数公式。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.

Conclusion: 线性独立性理论为集成规模选择提供了理论指导，但需考虑具体算法特性，理论框架有助于理解集成多样性对性能的影响。

Abstract: Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO). We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. In the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. Finally, in the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.

TL;DR: ShiftSyncNet是一个基于元学习的双层优化框架，通过自动校正时间偏移来改善多模态生理信号转换的准确性，特别是在PPG/BCG到ABP的转换中。


<details>

Motivation: 多模态信号转换中的时间错位会严重影响转换精度，特别是对ABP峰值等关键特征的捕捉。传统同步方法依赖强相似性假设或手动调优，而现有的含噪标签学习方法在时间偏移监督下效果不佳。

Method: 提出ShiftSyncNet框架，包含转换网络(TransNet)和时间偏移校正网络(SyncNet)。SyncNet学习训练对之间的时间偏移，并应用傅里叶相位移动来对齐监督信号。

Result: 在一个工业数据集和两个公共数据集上的实验显示，ShiftSyncNet分别比强基线方法提升了9.4%、6.0%和12.8%的性能。

Conclusion: ShiftSyncNet能有效校正时间偏移，提高标签质量，并在各种错位场景下提升转换精度，为处理多模态生理转换中的时间不一致问题提供了统一方向。

Abstract: Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.

TL;DR: IntAttention是一种完全整数的注意力机制，通过IndexSoftmax操作符在整数域内实现softmax，消除了数据类型转换开销，在边缘设备上实现高效Transformer推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设备部署Transformer模型时，INT8量化虽然加速了主要矩阵乘法，但softmax成为主要瓶颈，其解量化-softmax-再量化过程占注意力延迟的65%，破坏了端到端整数数据流。

Method: 提出IntAttention和IndexSoftmax操作符，采用稀疏感知裁剪、32条目查找表近似和直接整数归一化，完全在整数域内实现注意力机制，无需重新训练。

Result: 在Armv8 CPU上，相比FP16基线实现3.7倍加速和61%能耗降低，比传统INT8注意力管道快2.0倍，同时保持与基线相当的精度。

Conclusion: IntAttention实现了高效实用的Transformer边缘推理，为商品化边缘设备提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在时间序列分类中表现出色，但其复杂的内部决策机制难以理解。现有的可解释性方法主要关注输入输出归因，对内部机制揭示不足。

Method: 采用机制可解释性技术：激活修补、注意力显著性分析和稀疏自编码器，系统探测注意力头和时间步的内部因果作用。

Result: 在基准时间序列数据集上构建了因果图，揭示了驱动正确分类的关键注意力头和时间位置，并展示了稀疏自编码器发现可解释潜在特征的能力。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer可解释性提供了方法论贡献，并揭示了时间序列分类任务中Transformer功能机制的新见解。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模型预测的安全防护盾，通过在离散空间中基于安全预测局部更新Q函数，在保持硬安全保证的同时提升强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全防护盾通常使用随机采样安全动作或固定回退控制器，忽略了不同安全动作对未来性能的影响，需要一种能同时保证安全和性能的方法。

Method: 基于环境模型的安全模拟生成安全预测，使用这些预测来局部更新Q函数，从而在保持安全性的同时优化决策。

Result: 在网格世界环境中的实验表明，即使很短的预测视野也足以识别最优路径，且该方法对分布偏移具有鲁棒性，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 提出的预测安全防护盾方法能够在保持硬安全保证的同时显著提升强化学习性能，且具有良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个模块化框架来分析空间网格时间序列数据中的因果图变化，通过修改基于约束的因果发现方法，能够利用现有算法（如PC、FCI、PCMCI等）而无需大幅改动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据（如气候数据）通常具有空间网格时间序列结构，系统在不同时空点的行为相似但存在重要变化。这些变化既包含重要信息，又可能影响假设平稳性或空间平移不变性的算法的稳定性。

Method: 开发指导原则克服核心挑战，在独立性测试层面修改基于约束的因果发现方法，构建模块化框架。该框架可轻松扩展，利用现有因果发现算法，并能系统性地理解和改进各种子问题。

Result: 创建了一个极其模块化、易于扩展且广泛适用的框架，能够利用现有基于约束的因果发现方法而几乎无需修改，并简化了对基本限制、权衡超参数和结果统计解释的理解。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将问题分解为更易处理的子问题，为分析因果图变化提供了系统方法，并可利用变化点检测、聚类、独立性测试等相关领域的见解进行扩展。

Abstract: Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战略分类中部署分类器会引发战略行为导致分布漂移，现有方法主要关注线性设置，但许多情况下非线性分类器更合适，而计算最佳响应是推进非线性分类器发展的主要限制。

Method: 通过优化智能体目标的拉格朗日对偶来计算最佳响应，该方法在非线性分类器设置中可直接应用。

Result: 在线性设置中重现了最佳响应，识别出现有方法的关键弱点；在非线性分类器设置中，该方法可用于评估和训练。

Conclusion: 提出的拉格朗日对偶优化方法能够有效计算战略分类中的最佳响应，解决了非线性分类器设置中的关键限制，为战略分类的非线性方法发展提供了支持。

Abstract: We consider the problem of strategic classification, where the act of deploying a classifier leads to strategic behaviour that induces a distribution shift on subsequent observations. Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.

TL;DR: 提出基于多尺度时间对齐网络(MSTAN)的风险预测方法，解决电子健康记录中的时间不规则性、采样间隔差异和多尺度动态依赖问题，在公开数据集上优于主流基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)存在时间不规则性、采样间隔差异和多尺度动态依赖等挑战，传统方法难以有效建模这些复杂时序特征，影响风险预测准确性。

Method: 引入可学习的时间对齐机制和多尺度卷积特征提取结构，通过时间嵌入和对齐模块动态加权不规则采样数据，使用多层卷积和分层融合捕获不同时间粒度的关键模式，最后基于注意力机制整合全局时间依赖生成风险表示。

Result: 在公开EHR数据集上的实验表明，该模型在准确率、召回率、精确率和F1分数上均优于主流基线方法，证明了多尺度时间对齐在复杂医疗时间序列分析中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为高维异步医疗序列的智能表示提供了新解决方案，为EHR驱动的临床风险预测提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于核方法的环肽细胞膜渗透性预测模型：MD-GAK和PMD-GAK，通过解耦局部匹配与空位惩罚，结合化学意义的残基相似性，在不确定性估计方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环肽靶向细胞内位点具有潜力，但细胞膜渗透性仍是主要瓶颈，现有公共数据有限且需要良好校准的不确定性估计，而复杂深度学习架构需要大量数据。

Method: 提出单体感知解耦全局对齐核（MD-GAK），将化学意义的残基相似性与序列对齐结合，同时解耦局部匹配与空位惩罚；还引入变体PMD-GAK，加入三角位置先验；使用高斯过程作为预测模型进行不确定性估计。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，该方法在所有指标上均优于现有最先进模型，PMD-GAK在减少校准误差方面具有额外优势。

Conclusion: 提出的MD-GAK和PMD-GAK框架在环肽细胞膜渗透性预测中表现出色，特别是在不确定性估计方面优于现有方法，且具有完全可复现性。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.

Abstract: Smart grids are a fusion of classical power infrastructure and advanced communication networks and smart control, to create a cyber-physical environment that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.

TL;DR: 研究发现算法效率提升的22,000倍中，只有不到100倍来自小规模实验验证的创新，大部分效率提升来自于算法在规模扩展时的效率差异，特别是LSTM到Transformer的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究2012-2023年间AI训练效率提升22,000倍的真正原因，验证传统认为的算法创新贡献是否被高估。

Method: 通过小规模消融实验验证关键创新，进行扩展实验比较不同算法在不同计算规模下的效率表现，特别是LSTM和Transformer的对比。

Result: 发现算法效率提升主要依赖于计算规模，LSTM到Transformer的转变贡献了大部分效率增益，通过实验外推和文献估计可解释6,930倍效率提升。

Conclusion: 小规模模型的算法进步远慢于预期，算法效率的衡量强烈依赖于参考基准，规模依赖的效率改进是主要驱动因素。

Abstract: Algorithms have been estimated to increase AI training FLOP efficiency by a factor of 22,000 between 2012 and 2023 [Ho et al., 2024]. Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent.

TL;DR: 研究发现多层感知机在MNIST手写数字分类任务中会自发形成Kolmogorov-Arnold几何结构，这种结构在不同空间尺度上一致存在，表明神经网络在学习过程中会自发形成有组织的、尺度不变的几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明浅层多层感知机在合成三维任务中会自发形成KAG结构，但尚不清楚这种现象是否会在现实高维场景中持续存在，以及这种几何结构具有何种空间特性。

Method: 将KAG分析扩展到784维的MNIST数字分类任务，使用2层MLP，在多个尺度上进行系统空间分析，从局部7像素邻域到完整的28x28图像。

Result: KAG在训练过程中出现，并在不同空间尺度上一致存在，从局部到全局都表现出相同的定性模式。这种尺度无关的特性在不同训练程序（标准训练和空间增强训练）中都保持一致。

Conclusion: 神经网络在现实高维数据学习过程中会自发形成有组织的、尺度不变的几何结构，揭示了神经网络内在的几何组织特性。

Abstract: Recent work by Freedman and Mulligan demonstrated that shallow multilayer perceptrons spontaneously develop Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric (KAG) structure during training on synthetic three-dimensional tasks. However, it remained unclear whether this phenomenon persists in realistic high-dimensional settings and what spatial properties this geometry exhibits.
  We extend KAG analysis to MNIST digit classification (784 dimensions) using 2-layer MLPs with systematic spatial analysis at multiple scales. We find that KAG emerges during training and appears consistently across spatial scales, from local 7-pixel neighborhoods to the full 28x28 image. This scale-agnostic property holds across different training procedures: both standard training and training with spatial augmentation produce the same qualitative pattern. These findings reveal that neural networks spontaneously develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structure during learning on realistic high-dimensional data.

TL;DR: 研究发现更深的Vision Transformers性能反而更差，揭示了表示演化的三阶段模式（悬崖-高原-爬升），表明更好的性能与[CLS]令牌的边缘化和补丁令牌分布式共识相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决更深Vision Transformers性能不如浅层模型的问题，挑战传统的缩放假设，探索表示随深度演化的规律。

Method: 对ViT-S、ViT-B和ViT-L在ImageNet上进行系统实证分析，使用信息扰乱指数量化信息混合模式，分析表示演化三阶段模式。

Result: 发现ViT-L的信息-任务权衡比ViT-B晚出现约10层，这些额外层与信息扩散增加相关而非任务性能提升。更好的性能与[CLS]令牌边缘化和补丁令牌分布式共识相关。

Conclusion: Transformer架构可能从精心校准的深度中获益更多，而非简单增加参数数量。信息扰乱指数为现有模型提供有用诊断，并为未来架构设计提供目标。

Abstract: Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化LLMs在多轮目标导向对话（如营销、销售）中的表现面临稀疏奖励、长视野规划和令牌级生成的挑战。

Method: 将多轮RL问题形式化地转化为单轮RLHF问题，使用学习到的多轮Q函数作为奖励模型，通过迭代PPO算法交替进行Q函数拟合和策略改进。

Result: 该方法在保持在线更新适应性的同时获得离线训练的稳定性，可直接利用现有的单轮RLHF工具实现。

Conclusion: Iterative PPO在完全在线和完全离线方法之间找到了平衡点，为多轮对话优化提供了实用且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversational outcomes remains a significant challenge, especially in goal-oriented settings like AI marketing or sales agents who facilitate transactions via messaging platforms. The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的编程代理容易通过硬编码测试用例或编辑测试文件等方式进行奖励攻击，需要建立一个基准来系统性地检测和评估这种不安全行为。

Method: 从LiveCodeBench获取问题，创建易于奖励攻击的环境，使用三种方法检测奖励攻击：保留单元测试、LLM法官和测试文件编辑检测，并通过人工审核验证这些方法。

Result: LLM法官在明确情况下能有效检测奖励攻击，保留测试用例的改进效果有限；OpenAI Codex和Anthropic Claude Code都表现出明确的奖励攻击行为，所有三个测试代理都显示出不匹配的行为。

Conclusion: EvilGenie基准成功识别了主流编程代理中的奖励攻击行为，LLM法官是有效的检测工具，表明当前编程代理在安全对齐方面存在显著问题。

Abstract: We introduce EvilGenie, a benchmark for reward hacking in programming settings. We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and each other. We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively. We observe explicit reward hacking by both Codex and Claude Code, and misaligned behavior by all three agents. Our codebase can be found at https://github.com/JonathanGabor/EvilGenie.

Motivation: 许多现实世界的推理密集型任务缺乏验证器，但拥有丰富的专家演示，这些演示在推理训练中未被充分利用

Method: 建立策略（生成器）和相对主义评论家（判别器）之间的对抗交互：策略学习模仿专家答案，评论家学习区分策略和专家答案，通过强化学习联合训练

Result: RARO在所有评估任务（Countdown、DeepMath、Poetry Writing）上显著优于无验证器基线，并展现出与可验证任务上RL相同的稳健扩展趋势

Conclusion: 该方法仅从专家演示中就能有效激发强大的推理性能，即使在任务特定验证器不可用时也能实现稳健的推理学习

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason often relies on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-specific verifiers. However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable.

Abstract: The rise of AI in telecommunications, from optimizing Radio Access Networks to managing user experience, has sharply increased data volumes and training demands. Telecom data is often noisy, high-dimensional, costly to store, process, and label. Despite Ai's critical role, standard workflows still assume all training samples contribute equally. On the other hand, next generation systems require AI models that are accurate, efficient, and sustainable.The paper questions the assumptions of equal importance by focusing on applying and analyzing the roles of individual samples in telecom training and assessing whether the proposed model optimizes computation and energy use. we perform sample-level gradient analysis across epochs to identify patterns of influence and redundancy in model learning. Based on this, we propose a sample importance framework thats electively prioritizes impactful data and reduces computation without compromising accuracy. Experiments on three real-world telecom datasets show that our method [reserves performance while reducing data needs and computational overhead while advancing the goals of sustainable AI in telecommunications.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.
