### [1] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，通过中间梯度计算敏感度分数，解决3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外视角渲染时的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外的视角渲染时会出现严重的视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏训练数据导致密度、颜色和几何预测不确定。

Method: 利用中间梯度计算敏感度分数，专门针对各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤，而非各向同性方差。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比现有NeRF方法（如BayesRays）显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性，并能实时集成到现有3DGS渲染流程中。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3DGS模型在训练分布外视角的生成不确定性，无需重新训练或微调即可保持高视觉保真度。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [2] [From Far and Near: Perceptual Evaluation of Crowd Representations Across Levels of Detail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20558)
*Xiaohan Sun,Carol O'Sullivan*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同人群表示方法在视觉质量和计算效率之间的平衡，为设计感知优化的LoD策略提供指导。

Method: 使用几何网格、图像代理、NeRF和3D高斯四种表示方法，在不同LoD和观看距离下进行定性和定量评估。

Result: 不同表示方法在视觉保真度和计算性能方面表现出明显的权衡关系，为感知优化的LoD策略提供了具体见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计基于感知的人群渲染LoD策略提供了有价值的指导，帮助在视觉质量和计算效率之间做出平衡决策。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how users perceive the visual quality of crowd
character representations at different levels of detail (LoD) and viewing
distances. Each representation: geometric meshes, image-based impostors, Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and 3D Gaussians, exhibits distinct trade-offs between
visual fidelity and computational performance. Our qualitative and quantitative
results provide insights to guide the design of perceptually optimized LoD
strategies for crowd rendering.

### [3] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用频域分析和深度学习检测StyleGAN生成的图像，通过2D傅里叶变换和ResNet50网络实现92.8%的准确率，显著优于空间域方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成的逼真图像对图像取证和工业系统内容真实性构成严重挑战，需要可靠的方法来区分真实图像和合成图像。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到频域，然后使用ResNet50神经网络在频域图像上进行训练，以检测GAN图像中的周期性伪影。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的同等模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征，结合信号处理和深度学习的方法在数字取证和工业AI系统可信度增强方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [4] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了将Vision Transformers与对比学习目标结合用于3D形状特征表示学习，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%准确率，克服了CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时的挑战，传统CNN方法需要大量标注数据且可能忽略关键的形状关系。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers架构与现代对比学习目标（包括监督对比学习和自监督对比学习）相结合，进行多视角3D分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，监督对比损失达到了约90.6%的准确率，证明了ViT与对比学习结合的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT能够理解整体形状，对比学习能够优化局部判别特征，这种结合克服了传统方法对大量标注数据的依赖和CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的限制。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [5] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个模块化的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过引入基于transformer的平滑器和融合驱动的跟踪器，在现有3D检测器基础上构建，无需显式运动模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受基于查询的跟踪框架启发，旨在利用多模态传感器特征提升transformer跟踪方法的性能，解决遮挡和视角变化下的鲁棒重识别问题。

Method: 采用多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程，融合相机和LiDAR的BEV特征，使用时间平滑器在移动窗口内精炼边界框序列。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上评估，FutrTrack在nuScenes测试集上达到74.7 aMOTA，在3D MOT基准测试中表现优异，减少了身份切换同时保持竞争性精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为改进基于transformer的跟踪器提供了高效框架，即使数据有限且无需预训练，也能与其他基于神经网络的方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [6] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑(OLS)通过动态调整软标签来减少医学图像分类中深度学习模型的过度自信预测，在RadImageNet数据集上相比传统方法提升了分类准确率和特征表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中经常产生过度自信的预测，这会降低其在关键医疗场景中的可靠性。传统标签平滑方法无法考虑类别间关系，将所有非目标类别同等对待。

Method: 采用在线标签平滑(OLS)方法，这是一种动态方法，根据模型自身的预测模式在整个训练过程中调整软标签。在RadImageNet数据集上使用ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构进行评估。

Result: OLS相比标准训练方法（包括硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏）持续提升了Top-1和Top-5分类准确率。此外，OLS产生了更紧凑和良好分离的特征嵌入，表明表示学习得到改善。

Conclusion: OLS不仅增强了预测性能，还提高了校准度，使其成为医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个针对鱼眼相机图像的目标检测框架，通过预处理和后处理管道以及模型集成策略，在鱼眼交通图像上实现鲁棒检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机在广域交通监控中具有优势，但其固有的径向失真和非均匀分辨率给标准目标检测器带来挑战，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化。

Method: 采用简单有效的预处理和后处理管道，结合多个最先进检测模型的集成策略，提升在鱼眼图像上的检测一致性。

Result: 在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4中达到0.6366的F1分数，在62个团队中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的检测问题，在严重失真条件下实现了鲁棒的目标检测。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [8] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle是一个混合两阶段框架，结合物理建模和机器学习，用于通过稀疏孔径采集实现准确的脑部声速成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理方法受限于颅骨引起的信号衰减和稀疏孔径问题，而纯数据驱动方法在低信噪比条件下会产生定量偏差。

Method: 第一阶段使用逆时偏移处理多角度采集数据，第二阶段使用基于transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器融合迁移片段。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验显示，BrainPuzzle实现了优越的声速重建精度和图像完整性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了推进定量超声脑成像的潜力，特别是在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [9] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究对生成图像模型中的文化偏见进行了统一评估，重点关注文本到图像生成和图像到图像编辑系统，发现模型倾向于默认使用全球北方、现代风格的描绘，迭代编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，且编辑模型仅应用表面线索而非上下文感知的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作主要研究文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像编辑系统研究不足。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过标准化协议评估两种系统的文化偏见。

Method: 使用六个国家的统一评估框架，包含8个类别/36个子类别的分类体系，结合时代感知提示词。采用开放模型和固定设置，结合标准自动指标、文化感知检索增强VQA和本地评审专家的专业判断。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 在国家无关提示词下，模型默认使用全球北方、现代倾向的描绘，模糊了跨国差异；(2) 迭代图像到图像编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，即使传统指标保持稳定或改善；(3) 图像到图像模型应用表面线索而非时代一致、上下文感知的变化，对全球南方目标常保留源身份。

Conclusion: 当前系统中的文化敏感编辑仍然不可靠。通过发布标准化数据、提示词和人类评估协议，为诊断和跟踪生成图像模型中的文化偏见提供了可复现、以文化为中心的基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [10] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FIBAR方法，一种基于滤波器的异步重建方法，用于从移动事件相机的事件中重建强度图像，无需神经网络，可在CPU上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的强度图像重建方法通常需要GPU，计算复杂且成本高，需要一种更简单、高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用时域数字IIR滤波器积分事件强度变化，通过新颖算法检测陈旧像素并调节最近更新像素窗口，对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波以减少重建噪声。

Result: FIBAR在笔记本电脑CPU上以约42-140百万事件/秒的速度运行，重建图像比神经网络方法噪声更大且存在重影，但足以完成某些任务如检测基准标记。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单、高效的异步图像重建方法，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但在某些应用场景下已足够使用，且计算成本更低。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的变换双边张量低秩表示模型TBTLRR，通过数据自适应的张量核范数学习任意酉变换，能更有效捕捉全局相关性，并利用双边结构挖掘局部相关性，集成ℓ1/2范数和Frobenius范数处理复杂噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换，对噪声鲁棒性差，需要更灵活的数据自适应变换和更好的噪声处理能力。

Method: TBTLRR模型引入数据自适应张量核范数学习任意酉变换，利用双边结构挖掘局部相关性，集成ℓ1/2范数和Frobenius范数正则化项，采用基于ADMM的优化算法求解。

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法在聚类任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TBTLRR通过数据自适应变换和双边结构，在图像聚类中表现出优越性能，能有效处理复杂噪声。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源跨平台应用，用于标准化和去识别化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式异构性和隐私问题，支持手术数据科学应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和手术数据科学在手术培训、研究和质量改进中有重要作用，但受限于异构的视频记录格式和视频共享的隐私问题。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期，基于用户反馈迭代开发。通过内部调查确定关键需求，采用隐私设计架构，外部调查评估可用性和采用度，并在不同硬件配置上进行基准测试。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性（4.68/5和4.03/5），改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）、启发式可用性（4.38/5）和强烈推荐（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了一个透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程。需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证才能成为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [13] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Attentive Convolution (ATConv)的新型卷积算子，通过引入自适应路由和侧向抑制机制，使CNN能够达到甚至超越自注意力机制的性能，同时保持线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强，但其二次复杂度限制了实际应用。传统卷积具有线性复杂度但性能存在差距，作者旨在揭示自注意力优于卷积的根本原因，并设计出兼具两者优势的新方法。

Method: 通过分析发现自注意力的两个关键优势：自适应路由和侧向抑制。基于此设计了ATConv，在卷积操作中注入这些原则，使用3×3核就能超越各种自注意力机制。

Result: 基于ATConv构建的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%的Top-1准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散模型中替换自注意力为ATConv，在SiT-XL/2上将ImageNet FID降低0.15，采样速度更快。

Conclusion: ATConv成功将自注意力的核心优势融入卷积操作，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了超越自注意力的性能，为视觉主干网络设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了StableSketcher框架，通过优化VAE编码器和集成基于视觉问答的奖励函数，使扩散模型能够生成具有高提示保真度的手绘草图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在图像生成方面取得进展，但在生成像素级手绘草图（抽象表达的代表）方面仍存在挑战，现有数据集主要依赖图像-标签对，缺乏实例级草图与描述性文本的配对。

Method: 1. 微调变分自编码器以优化潜在解码，更好地捕捉草图特征；2. 集成基于视觉问答的新奖励函数，通过强化学习提高文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明StableSketcher生成的草图具有改进的风格保真度，与提示的对齐性优于Stable Diffusion基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出了首个包含实例级草图与标题、问答对的数据集SketchDUO，解决了现有数据集的局限性，代码和数据集将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 该研究探索使用描述性标题作为生物多模态基础模型的额外监督来源，通过多模态大语言模型生成合成标题来弥补标注数据不足，训练出BIOCAP模型在物种分类和图文检索方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物多模态基础模型缺乏大规模实例特异性标注数据，限制了自然语言监督在生物领域的应用，需要寻找替代方案来获取准确的描述性标题。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科视觉信息和分类群定制的格式示例来减少幻觉，产生准确的实例描述性标题，并训练BIOCAP模型。

Result: BIOCAP模型能够捕获丰富的语义信息，在物种分类和文本-图像检索任务中表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签的价值，能够有效连接生物图像与多模态基础模型。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光场获取需要计算成本或专用设备，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在通过单张图像生成光场，扩大光场技术的适用性。

Method: 设计神经渲染管道，首先存储输入图像的光线流，通过交叉注意力计算关系，预测目标光线颜色。采用迭代方式生成新视角并更新遮挡内容。

Result: 该方法在多个挑战性数据集上表现良好，无需重新训练或微调，优于相关的最先进新视角合成方法。

Conclusion: 逆图像渲染方法能够有效从单张图像生成光场，展示了在无需显式3D重建的情况下实现高质量新视角合成的潜力。

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LogitGap方法，通过利用最大logit与其他logit之间的关系来增强ID和OOD样本的可分性，在OOD检测中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后处理方法往往未充分利用模型logits空间中丰富的信息，特别是在最大logit与剩余logit之间的关系方面。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，显式利用最大logit与剩余logit之间的关系，并引入无训练策略自动识别最信息丰富的logits子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在各种OOD检测场景和基准测试中始终达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logit空间中的关系信息，为OOD检测提供了一种高效且有效的后处理方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有数据集如PartNet依赖无纹理几何和专家标注，限制了可扩展性和实用性。PartNeXt旨在解决这些限制，通过可扩展标注、纹理感知标签和多任务评估来推动结构化3D理解研究。

Method: 构建包含23,000多个高质量纹理3D模型的数据集，提供细粒度层次化部件标注，涵盖50个类别。在类无关部件分割和3D部件中心问答两个任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 在类无关部件分割任务中，现有方法在细粒度和叶级部件上表现不佳；在3D部件中心问答任务中，3D-LLMs在开放词汇部件定位方面存在显著差距。使用PartNeXt训练Point-SAM相比PartNet获得显著提升。

Conclusion: PartNeXt通过可扩展标注、纹理感知标签和多任务评估，为结构化3D理解研究开辟了新途径，展示了数据集在质量和多样性方面的优越性。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单张RGB图像进行类别级8D姿态估计的方法，用于估计铰接式自行车和骑手的姿态，除了6D姿态外还能估计车把和踏板的旋转角度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，骑行者属于易受伤害的道路使用者，准确估计其姿态对于意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统6D姿态估计方法无法处理自行车铰接部件的变化，因为车把和踏板的角度变化会影响3D边界框和实际行驶方向。

Method: 提出联合估计8D姿态和3D关键点的模型，使用合成和真实图像数据进行训练，能够从单张图像估计自行车的3D平移、旋转以及车把和踏板相对于车身的旋转角度。

Result: 该方法在8D姿态参数估计上表现出有前景的结果，与使用刚性规范对象模板匹配的最先进类别级6D姿态估计器相比取得了有竞争力的分数。

Conclusion: 8D姿态估计能够提供更细粒度的自行车姿态状态和行驶方向信息，对于自动驾驶中的骑行者安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Motivation: 现有组合零样本学习方法在测试时由于包含未见过的属性-对象组合，导致标签空间分布偏移，造成性能下降。

Method: 1) 积累文本和视觉模态的无监督数据知识更新多模态原型；2) 设计自适应更新权重控制原型调整程度；3) 引入动态优先级队列存储高置信度图像；4) 通过多模态协作表示学习对齐文本和视觉原型。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，在封闭世界和开放世界设置下均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TOMCAT方法通过多模态知识积累和自适应原型更新，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

Motivation: 利用信息瓶颈(IB)框架来优化GAN，旨在实现更好的解耦表示学习，克服InfoGAN等现有方法的局限性。

Method: 在GAN生成器中引入中间随机层，约束输入与生成输出之间的互信息，该中间随机层作为可学习的潜在分布与生成器联合端到端训练。

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAEs竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，IB-GAN生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID得分上优于β-VAEs和Info-GAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架成功实现了GAN的无监督解耦表示学习，在解耦性能和生成质量方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体视频的时序一致性深度估计对于增强现实等应用至关重要，但现有方法在建模长程时序一致性时面临计算效率与性能的权衡问题。

Method: 提出Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM)模块，包含'pick'过程选择最相关帧和'play'过程自适应加权选择帧进行时空聚合，模拟人类两阶段决策过程。

Result: 在Sintel数据集上，PPMStereo在clean/final上分别达到0.62/1.11 TEPE，相比BiDAStereo提升17.3%和9.02%，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程实现了紧凑而信息丰富的内存缓冲区，在准确性和时序一致性方面均达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 当前模型在多智能体行人动态模拟方面表现出色，但仍有改进空间，特别是在处理人物合并和消失问题上。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Motivation: 现有离散分类方法无法捕捉可疑意图的连续特性，限制了早期干预和可解释性。可疑意图具有长期依赖和累积效应，需要连续建模。

Conclusion: 连续可疑度建模方法相比离散分类系统，能实现更早检测和主动干预，显著增强安全应用中的可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Motivation: 脑MRI基础模型的发展依赖于数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但目前缺乏对这些因素的系统评估。

Method: 在数据集层面分析模态组成、疾病覆盖和规模；在图像层面量化体素间距、方向和强度分布；评估预处理变异性；使用3D DenseNet121进行特征空间案例研究。

Result: 发现健康队列与临床人群之间存在强烈不平衡，预处理步骤改善了数据集内一致性但数据集间差异仍然存在，标准化预处理后仍存在可测量的残差协变量偏移。

Conclusion: 公共脑MRI资源存在显著变异性，仅靠数据协调无法消除数据集间偏差，需要预处理感知和领域自适应策略来开发可泛化的脑MRI基础模型。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

TL;DR: RAPO++是一个跨阶段的提示优化框架，通过检索增强提示优化、样本特定提示优化和LLM微调，显著提升文本到视频生成质量，无需修改底层生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户提供的提示通常简短、非结构化且与训练数据不匹配，限制了基于扩散的文本到视频模型的生成潜力。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 检索增强提示优化，从关系图中检索语义相关修饰符并重构提示；2) 样本特定提示优化，使用多源反馈迭代优化提示；3) 使用优化提示对微调LLM，内化优化模式。

Result: 在五个最先进的T2V模型和五个基准测试中，RAPO++在语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性方面取得显著提升，大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPO++是一个模型无关、成本高效且可扩展的解决方案，为T2V生成中的提示优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCycle提出了一种基于流的无反转图像编辑框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化和循环一致性优化，实现目标感知的中间状态构建，从而在保持源图像一致性的同时实现忠实修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本图像编辑方法采用目标无关的中间状态构建方式，主要关注源图像重建而忽略了与特定编辑目标的语义差距，导致在需要大幅修改时编辑能力有限或不一致。

Method: FlowCycle框架参数化可学习的噪声，通过包含双重一致性约束的循环一致性过程进行优化，迭代地从源图像编辑到目标图像再恢复回源图像，学习生成目标感知的中间状态。

Result: 广泛的消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态构建，实现了更好的文本图像编辑效果，在保持源图像一致性的同时能够进行忠实的修改。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统胎儿运动检测方法（如孕妇感知和胎心监护）存在主观性强和准确性有限的问题，需要更可靠的客观检测方法。

Method: 使用双重对比损失的自监督学习框架，结合空间和时间对比学习，采用任务特定采样策略，并通过概率微调方法实现灵活推理。

Result: 在92名受试者的30分钟超声数据上，CURL达到78.01%的敏感度和81.60%的AUROC。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有潜力，为改进产前监测和临床决策提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的图像编辑方法受限于图像反演过程中的近似误差，这些误差源于中间生成步骤缺乏精确监督。

Method: 采用基于 VQ 的生成模型，利用其可获取精确中间量化表示的特性；提出集成文本提示校正和图像风格保留的高效图像反演机制；设计整体平滑策略。

Result: 在 PIE-Bench 基准测试中，在"添加"、"更改"和"删除"编辑操作上表现出优于现有扩散基线的性能。

Conclusion: EditInfinity 通过精确的图像反演和有效的编辑策略，实现了高质量的文本驱动图像编辑。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [31] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时更容易产生幻觉，研究发现这不是长度本身导致的，而是因为长文本对上下文连贯性和完整性的依赖增加。作者提出了"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来主动管理幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本响应时存在严重的幻觉问题，传统观点认为这是由长度引起的错误累积，但作者质疑是否存在更深层的机制。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"三步框架：通过设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 该方法在所有基准测试中都取得了显著且一致的改进，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅验证了提出的框架，更重要的是重新验证了关于上下文依赖导致幻觉的假设，为深入探索LVLMs长文本响应中的幻觉问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

TL;DR: COS3D是一个用于开放词汇3D分割的协作提示分割框架，通过实例场和语言场的协作，有效整合语言和分割线索，解决了现有方法依赖单一3D语言场或预计算分割的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于高斯溅射的开放词汇3D分割方法要么依赖单一3D语言场导致分割效果不佳，要么依赖预计算的类无关分割导致错误累积，需要更有效的整合语言和分割线索的方法。

Method: 提出协作场概念，包含实例场和语言场；通过实例到语言特征映射和两阶段训练策略构建协作场；在推理时设计自适应语言到实例提示优化。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中表现出领先性能，并在图像驱动的3D分割、分层分割和机器人应用等方面显示出高潜力。

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作提示分割框架有效解决了开放词汇3D分割的挑战，在多个应用场景中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了DualGround双分支架构，通过分离全局和局部语义来改进视频时间定位任务，在句子级和短语级语义对齐方面实现更精细的时间定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态注意力中统一处理所有文本标记，忽视了它们不同的语义角色，导致模型过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而无法有效利用词级信号。

Method: 使用双分支架构，将[EOS]标记通过句子级路径处理，将词标记聚类为短语级单元进行局部定位，引入基于标记角色的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试中，在时刻检索和高亮检测任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦的语义建模在视频语言对齐中非常有效，能够同时捕捉粗粒度和局部语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于关键点的位置编码，仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限

Method: 提出掩码位置编码方案利用分割掩码捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓；设计上下文增强模块使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征；集成MPE和CEM构建端到端EDGeo框架

Result: 在两个公共数据集上实现最先进性能，在具有挑战性的地面到卫星场景下定位精度提升3.39%

Conclusion: 为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了鲁棒的位置编码范式和上下文建模框架

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，引导融合过程达成更可靠的多模态共识，提升情感识别准确性

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过利用多模态信息的多样性来精炼提取的特征，有效减少视觉特征中的冗余，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径，通过两阶段训练框架（SFT+RL）实现GUI grounding的突破性性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI grounding方法将指令视为静态代理，忽视了指令多样性和质量对性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集有23.3%的指令缺陷，利用指令多样性可在推理时获得76%的相对性能提升。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：首先在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调（SFT），培养多视角推理能力；然后通过强化学习（RL）优化路径选择和组合。

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B模型在五个挑战性基准测试中取得最先进结果：UI-I2E-Bench 87.3%、ScreenSpot-Pro 57.0%、MMBench-GUI L2 84.9%。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: Instruction-as-Reasoning范式显著提升了GUI grounding性能，模型展现出涌现推理能力，能够在推理时选择性组合和合成新的指令路径，同时缓解了SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at
inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust
cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

TL;DR: 提出HyperET方法，利用双曲空间解决多模态大语言模型中视觉编码器与语言在多粒度级别对齐不足的问题，显著提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs需要大量计算资源进行训练，主要原因是广泛使用的视觉编码器（如CLIP、SAM）缺乏与语言在多粒度级别的对齐。

Method: 利用双曲空间建模层次结构，通过动态调整双曲半径实现视觉与文本在任意粒度级别的对齐，采用可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试中，HyperET仅增加不到1%的参数就能显著提升现有预训练和微调MLLMs的性能。

Conclusion: HyperET为MLLMs提供了一种高效的多粒度对齐训练范式，解决了视觉-文本模态间的粒度差距问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于深度学习的点云几何压缩中泛化性不足的问题，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对OOD数据处理的低效性。

Method: 1. 通用上下文模型：利用空间和通道分组先验来捕捉鲁棒的上下文依赖关系；2. 实例自适应微调(IAFT)：结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调少量网络权重并纳入比特流。

Result: 在包含15个多样化数据集的基准测试中，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过创新的上下文建模和自适应微调策略，有效解决了点云压缩中的泛化挑战，为可复现研究提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中，量化误差会在多个去噪步骤中累积，导致性能下降。现有方法独立处理每个步骤的误差，无法解决累积问题。

Method: AccuQuant在量化过程中显式模拟多个去噪步骤，考虑多步误差累积，并提出高效实现技术将内存复杂度从O(n)降低到O(1)。

Result: 在多个任务和扩散模型的标准基准测试中，AccuQuant展现出优异的效能和效率。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过解决量化误差累积问题，为扩散模型提供了高效且有效的后训练量化解决方案。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视DiT如何组织视觉内容，发现补丁标记表现出惊人的独立性：即使位置编码被扰动，DiT仍能产生全局一致的输出，表明空间一致性主要由位置编码控制。

Method: 引入位置编码场(PE-Field)，将位置编码从2D平面扩展到结构化3D场，包含用于体积推理的深度感知编码和用于细粒度子补丁控制的分层编码。

Result: PE-Field增强的DiT在单图像新视角合成方面达到最先进性能，并能推广到可控空间图像编辑。

Conclusion: 位置编码在DiT中起着关键作用，PE-Field通过扩展位置编码到3D场，使DiT能够直接在3D空间中建模几何，显著提升了视觉生成能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

<details>

Motivation: 现有图像-食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致表示学习偏向主导视觉元素，难以区分具有细微差异的相似食谱

Method: 提出因果方法预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并明确将这些元素注入跨模态表示学习以减轻偏差

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化数据集上，该方法能够发现细微的配料和烹饪动作，实现令人印象深刻的检索性能

Conclusion: 因果表示学习能有效缓解图像-食谱检索中的模态偏差问题，提升对细微烹饪细节的识别能力

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

Conclusion: Conan框架通过证据支撑的多步骤视频推理，有效解决了视频推理中的挑战，具有强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Conclusion: 为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了一个可靠的基础，并促进了透明度和可复现性

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型建立了一种快速有效个性化的新范式，通过双向协作机制实现了概念的高效蒸馏和生成质量的提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Metis-HOME混合专家框架，通过思维分支和非思维分支解决多模态推理模型在效率与通用性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型存在两个关键局限：对简单查询也使用计算昂贵的推理导致效率低下，以及专注于专门推理会损害更广泛的通用理解能力。

Method: 将原始密集模型重构为两个专家分支：思维分支处理复杂多步推理，非思维分支优化快速直接推理任务。使用轻量级可训练路由器动态分配查询。

Result: 评估显示该方法不仅显著增强复杂推理能力，还改善了模型的通用能力，逆转了其他推理专用模型观察到的退化趋势。

Conclusion: 建立了一个构建强大且多功能MLLMs的新范式，有效解决了普遍存在的推理与泛化之间的困境。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)框架，通过细粒度面部区域概念划分和新的Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，解决了现有多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中缺乏细粒度感知的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在深度伪造分析中存在细粒度感知不足的问题：数据标注不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法输出文本伪造解释与视觉伪影证据之间的连接，也不支持任意面部区域的查询输入，导致响应不够基于面部视觉上下文。

Method: 首先定义面部图像概念树(FICT)对面部图像进行细粒度区域划分，获得更可靠的数据标注流程FiFa-Annotator。基于此提出新的Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，生成包含操作伪影分割掩码的文本伪造解释。最后提出统一的多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM，同时支持丰富的多模态输入输出。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线模型，在现有XDFA数据集上达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度数据标注和统一的多任务学习架构，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中的性能，实现了更好的视觉-语言连接和细粒度感知能力。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度学习框架，能够从单张模糊图像中联合估计潜在清晰图像和相机运动轨迹，在严重或空间变化模糊情况下达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机抖动导致的大范围或旋转运动引起的运动模糊仍然是图像恢复中的主要挑战，特别是当模糊严重或空间变化时，端到端的去模糊网络难以处理。

Method: 使用投影运动模糊模型(PMBM)，通过可微分模糊创建模块实现。神经网络预测完整的3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的端到端恢复网络训练。后处理阶段通过重模糊损失优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上均达到最先进性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现优于端到端去模糊网络。

Conclusion: 提出的模块化架构不仅提供可解释性，还能重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列，在复杂运动模糊场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging
conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an
open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive
navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization
accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To
overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced

demonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as
low-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for
developing navigation aids for the visually impaired.

Motivation: 解决消费级相机在复杂光照条件（低光、高动态范围、背光等）下图像质量不稳定的问题，包括曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，这些会降低下游视觉任务的性能。

Method: 提出ACamera-Net框架，包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子改善色彩一致性。针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像管线中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下泛化良好。大量实验表明ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法，无需依赖额外图像增强模块。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net通过直接预测相机参数有效解决了复杂光照条件下的图像质量问题，为消费级相机系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，通过整合显式的时空证据来进行视频推理，在V-STAR基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，相比Qwen2.5-VL基线提升了14.4%的mAM和24.2%的mLGM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理模型仅生成文本推理轨迹，而不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置。虽然OpenAI-o3等模型在图像上引发了证据中心推理的广泛兴趣，但将此能力扩展到视频更具挑战性，因为它需要在动态场景中进行联合时间跟踪和空间定位。

Method: 引入Open-o3 Video框架，整合显式时空证据到视频推理中；构建两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k（用于SFT）和STGR-RL-36k（用于RL），包含精心构建的时间和空间标注；采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计多个专门奖励函数，共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试中实现最先进性能，mAM提升14.4%，mLGM提升24.2%；在VideoMME、WorldSense、VideoMMMU和TVGBench等广泛视频理解基准测试中观察到一致改进；推理轨迹为测试时缩放提供有价值信号，实现置信度感知验证并提高答案可靠性。

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video成功将证据中心推理扩展到视频领域，通过整合显式时空证据显著提升了视频推理性能，同时生成的推理轨迹为测试时验证和置信度评估提供了有用工具。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

TL;DR: GenColorBench是首个针对文本到图像生成中颜色控制的综合基准测试，包含44K个颜色相关提示，覆盖400多种颜色，通过感知和自动评估揭示模型在精确颜色生成方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在细粒度颜色可控性方面表现不佳，无法准确匹配文本提示中指定的颜色。现有基准测试要么忽略颜色评估，要么依赖粗略评估，缺乏对RGB值解释和人类期望对齐等关键能力的系统评估。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11颜色系统构建GenColorBench基准，包含44,000个颜色聚焦提示，覆盖400多种颜色，包括其他地方没有的数值颜色。通过感知评估和自动评估两种方式对模型进行评估。

Result: 对流行文本到图像模型的评估显示性能存在差异，揭示了模型对哪些颜色约定理解最好，并识别了失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench评估将指导精确颜色生成的改进，该基准将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Result: 大量实验表明该方法优于其他最先进方法

Conclusion: 提出的基于相似性原型的框架在跨模态分割任务中取得了优异性能

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单目视频中重建自由移动物体的挑战，特别是在没有可靠姿态或深度线索以及任意物体运动的情况下。

Method: 使用双键记忆模块结合潜在外观-几何键和显式方向键，通过空间引导的内存读取和高效稀疏化机制，将当前帧特征与时间聚合的对象状态进行鲁棒融合。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理自由移动物体，提供全面而紧凑的对象覆盖，在重建质量、内存效率和计算成本方面表现出色。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

Motivation: 长视频理解面临计算复杂、内容分散的挑战，现有方法忽略时间依赖或依赖单模态证据，难以提供完整且与查询相关的上下文

Method: 包含语义-视觉共识帧选择模块（SVCFS）和答案共识精炼模块（ACR）。SVCFS通过时间感知语义分支和聚类引导视觉分支选择关键帧，ACR融合证据并约束答案空间来解决不一致性

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES框架有效提升了长视频理解的性能

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化对于3D医学影像中可扩展的视觉语言建模至关重要，而不仅仅是更大的语言骨干网络。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含10万张超高分辨率图像的数据集UltraHR-100K，以及一种频率感知的后训练方法，通过细节导向的时间步采样和软加权频率正则化来提升T2I扩散模型在超高分辨率场景下的细节生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高分辨率文本到图像生成中的两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量UHR T2I数据集，以及忽视针对UHR场景的细粒度细节合成训练策略。

Method: 1) 构建UltraHR-100K数据集，包含10万张超过3K分辨率的图像；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则化(SWFR)。

Result: 在提出的UltraHR-eval4K基准测试上，该方法显著提升了超高分辨率图像生成的细粒度细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据集和专门设计的训练策略，成功解决了UHR T2I生成中的细节合成问题，为超高分辨率图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种技术来减少多比特量化网络的训练开销：权重偏差校正和比特级核心集采样，在保持模型性能的同时将训练时间减少高达7.88倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多比特量化方法需要为每个支持的比特宽度重复全数据集更新，导致训练开销随精度数量线性增长，且需要额外微调阶段来支持更多精度选项

Method: 1) 权重偏差校正：通过中和量化引起的偏差并对齐激活分布，实现共享批归一化，无需微调；2) 比特级核心集采样：利用隐式知识转移现象，通过基于梯度的重要性评分选择紧凑信息子集进行训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在实现竞争性或更优精度的同时，训练时间减少高达7.88倍

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著降低了多比特量化网络的训练开销，同时保持了模型性能，为灵活部署深度神经网络提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant

*Xuyang Liu,Xiyan Gui,Yuchao Zhang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV是一种针对大型视觉语言模型KV缓存压缩的新方法，通过结合重要性和多样性来优化压缩效果，在极端压缩条件下显著提升多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对来减少存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，这限制了部署的可扩展性。

Method: MixKV方法分析注意力头间的语义冗余变化，自适应地平衡多样性和重要性来压缩KV对，而不是仅依赖重要性标准。

Result: 在极端压缩（预算=64）下，MixKV将基线方法平均提升5.1%，在GUI接地任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别获得8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过结合重要性和多样性有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升性能，并可无缝扩展到LLMs。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI是一种传感器无关的方法，能够从旋转LiDAR点云生成无损距离图像，无需制造商元数据或校准文件，实现零点损失和完整点云重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆信息损失，影响高保真应用。需要一种能够实现无损投影的方法。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断LiDAR传感器的关键内在参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束校准校正，实现无损投影。

Result: 在KITTI和DurLAR数据集上的全面评估显示，ALICE-LRI实现了完美的点保存，所有点云中零点损失，几何精度保持在传感器精度限制内。

Conclusion: 从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变，为需要完整几何保存的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: AutoScape框架能够有效生成长时域几何一致的驾驶场景视频，在质量和一致性方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Motivation: 扩散变换器模型在高分辨率图像生成时面临自注意力机制二次方计算成本的问题，训练超高分辨率模型成本极高。

Method: 利用扩散过程的光谱进展特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码的频率谱，使其与当前生成阶段匹配。

Conclusion: DyPE提供了一种高效的无训练方法，显著扩展了预训练扩散模型的分辨率能力，在高分辨率下效果尤为明显。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

Motivation: MeanFlow框架在少步生成建模中表现出色，但其成功机制尚未完全理解。研究发现MeanFlow目标自然分解为两个部分，且存在优化冲突和收敛缓慢的问题。

Method: 提出α-Flow统一框架，将轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow统一在一个公式中，采用从轨迹流匹配到MeanFlow的课程学习策略来解耦冲突目标。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上使用标准DiT骨干网络，α-Flow在所有规模和设置下均优于MeanFlow。最大的α-Flow-XL/2+模型在1-NFE和2-NFE下分别达到2.58和2.15的FID分数，创下新SOTA。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦MeanFlow中的冲突目标，实现了更好的收敛性能，为少步生成建模提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: 解决从单张2D图像进行3D重建的挑战，特别是相机姿态估计、形状重建和纹理恢复的联合优化问题。

Method: 将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，采用两阶段流匹配：粗阶段生成初始3D几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复，精阶段整合姿态对齐的图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Result: 在广泛实验中，Cupid在PSNR上获得超过3dB的提升，Chamfer距离减少超过10%，在姿态精度上与单目估计器相当，在视觉保真度上优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid通过统一的生成框架实现了鲁棒的姿态和形状估计，在3D重建任务中表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Conclusion: 这是首个研究雷达-相机共同特征集成及其在在线校准中用于实现MOT的工作，展示了框架在简化传感器映射和提高跟踪精度方面的有效性

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

Method: 基于图像生成的分割框架，利用MLLM输出视觉token，通过通用VQ-VAE解码为图像，采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成视觉token以降低推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越现有最优方法，推理速度显著提升，同时保持强大的理解能力。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg证明了通过生成方式实现分割的可行性，为统一多模态理解与像素级感知提供了新范式。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于纯Transformer的自回归视频预测模型，在物理模拟数据集上实现更长时间跨度的准确预测，比现有方法延长50%预测时长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型启发，探索Transformer在视觉领域的应用，特别是针对现有视频生成方法在物理模拟时间建模方面的不足。

Method: 使用纯Transformer架构，比较不同时空自注意力布局，采用连续像素空间表示进行自回归视频预测，无需复杂训练策略或潜在特征学习组件。

Result: 在物理模拟数据集上，相比潜在空间方法，物理准确预测的时间跨度延长达50%，同时在常见视频质量指标上保持可比性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verdict (SV)框架，通过结合多个轻量级草稿专家和大型裁决模型，在无需训练的情况下解决信息密集型图像中的多模态推理问题，实现错误纠正和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理信息密集型图像时面临挑战，这些图像密集交织文本注释和细粒度图形元素，主要困难在于精确定位密集布局中的关键线索和集成分散证据的多跳推理。

Method: 采用受推测解码启发的训练免费框架，包括草稿阶段（小型VLM作为草稿专家生成多样化定位候选的推理路径）和裁决阶段（强大VLM综合这些路径生成最终答案），并引入共识专家选择机制仅转发高一致性推理路径。

Result: 在具有挑战性的信息密集和高分辨率视觉问答基准测试（InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro、HR-Bench 4K）上取得一致性能提升，通过综合多个部分准确推理路径的正确见解，相比大型专有模型或训练流程实现错误纠正和成本效率。

Conclusion: SV框架通过合成多个部分准确推理路径的正确见解，在无需训练的情况下实现了错误纠正和成本效率，为信息密集型图像的多模态推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SpectraMorph框架，通过物理引导的自监督融合方法解决高光谱图像超分辨率问题，使用解混瓶颈结构，在MSI波段极少时仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，且在MSI波段很少时容易失效。需要一种既能保持高性能又具有物理可解释性的融合方法。

Method: 采用解混瓶颈结构：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用多层感知机从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，使用MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行自监督训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph持续优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线方法，与监督基线方法相比也极具竞争力，训练时间不到1分钟。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph提供可解释的中间结果，在MSI波段极少时仍保持鲁棒性，为高光谱超分辨率提供了一种物理引导的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LDDBM（潜在去噪扩散桥模型），这是一个基于潜在变量扩展的通用模态转换框架，能够在共享潜在空间中学习任意模态之间的桥接，无需对齐维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但扩展到跨模态转换仍面临挑战。现有方法存在维度共享、高斯先验和模态特定架构等限制，缺乏通用性和理论基础。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中操作，引入对比对齐损失确保语义一致性，设计领域无关的编码器-解码器架构进行潜在空间噪声预测，提出预测损失指导跨域转换训练。

Result: 在多种模态转换任务中表现优异，包括多视图到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视图场景合成。

Conclusion: LDDBM为通用模态转换建立了新的强基线，支持任意模态对，并通过综合实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体个性化文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现空间组合控制和身份保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多个主体，需要解决多主体生成中的空间控制和身份保持问题。

Method: 提出分层画布表示（每个主体在独立层上）和锁定机制（保持选定层高保真度，其他层灵活适应上下文），结合位置嵌入和互补数据采样策略。

Result: 实验表明LayerComposer在多主体个性化图像生成中实现了优越的空间控制和身份保持，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过分层画布和锁定机制有效解决了多主体个性化生成中的空间组合控制问题，无需架构修改即可实现高质量结果。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine是一个文本到视频生成模型，通过整体生成整个场景来解决现有模型在创建连贯多镜头叙事方面的不足，实现了从剪辑合成到自动化电影制作的关键转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频模型在生成连贯多镜头叙事方面的"叙事鸿沟"，这些模型擅长生成孤立片段但无法创建具有全局一致性的完整故事场景。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，同时使用稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集但镜头间稀疏）确保分钟级生成的效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出显著的新兴能力：对角色和场景的持久记忆，以及对电影技术的直观理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从剪辑合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

### [86] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中，检索功能完全由自注意力层负责，SSM层无法补偿注意力层的缺失。仅保留15%的注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究混合SSM-Transformer架构中不同组件的功能专门化程度，特别是自注意力层和SSM层在检索任务中的具体作用。

Method: 通过对RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型进行注意力消融实验和稀疏化实验，分析不同组件对检索任务的影响。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索完全失败（0%准确率），而SSM层没有补偿机制。仅保留15%注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留大部分MMLU表现。

Conclusion: 混合架构中的功能专门化严格，自注意力层主要专门用于检索任务，这些模型更像是专门化模块而非集成系统，对架构优化和可解释性有直接意义。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

TL;DR: NAS-DQN是一种在线自适应架构优化的深度强化学习智能体，通过将神经网络架构搜索控制器集成到训练循环中，实现动态网络重构，在连续控制任务中超越了固定架构设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习智能体的性能受限于固定的神经网络架构设计，需要通过昂贵的超参数搜索来确定，且一旦确定就无法在训练过程中调整。本研究旨在探索在线自适应架构优化是否能突破这一限制。

Method: 提出NAS-DQN智能体，将学习到的神经网络架构搜索控制器直接集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN在最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性方面均优于三个固定架构基线和随机搜索控制，且计算开销可忽略不计。学习到的搜索策略显著优于无方向的随机架构探索和选择不当的固定设计。

Conclusion: 架构自适应不仅是有益的，而且是在线深度强化学习中实现最优样本效率所必需的。RL智能体的设计不必是静态的离线选择，而是可以无缝集成为学习过程本身的动态组件。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在生成优化CUDA代码方面表现出色，但存在代码泄露风险和计算成本高的问题。小模型虽然轻量且隐私友好，但在复杂CUDA生成任务中推理能力不足。

Method: 提出ReGraphT框架：将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，使用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索。

Result: ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval基准测试上平均实现2.33倍加速，优于HPC专用微调模型和其他检索增强方法。

Conclusion: ReGraphT使小模型能够接近大模型性能，同时避免了隐私风险和过高计算开销。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

Motivation: 传统交通分配问题在大规模网络中计算复杂度呈非线性增长，变得计算昂贵

Method: 使用Transformer深度学习架构，直接预测均衡路径流量，捕捉OD对间的复杂相关性

Result: 在多个网络上测试，比传统优化方法快几个数量级，计算成本降低，预测精度提高

Conclusion: 该模型能灵活适应变化的需求和网络条件，支持交通管理和快速情景分析

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

Motivation: 医疗AI系统在诊断能力上表现出色，但在不同人口群体间存在显著的性能差异，这对少数群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理基础模型通过强化学习训练时会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见。

Method: FairGRPO采用分层强化学习方法，基于表征、任务难度和数据源对优势进行自适应重要性加权。当缺乏人口统计标签时，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体。

Result: 在7个临床诊断数据集上的实验表明，FairGRPO相比所有基准方法将预测公平性提高了27.2%，同时F1分数提高了12.49%。训练动态分析显示FairGRPO在优化过程中持续改善公平性。

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI中的公平性问题，基于该方法开发的FairMedGemma-4B模型在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了人口群体间的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

Conclusion: FINDER在特定条件下优于现有方法，但存在失败模式和局限性，需要进一步讨论其适用范围。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific

### [93] [Beyond the Ideal: Analyzing the Inexact Muon Update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19933)
*Egor Shulgin,Sultan AlRashed,Francesco Orabona,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了Muon优化器中近似正交化更新的理论性能，建立了LMO优化框架下的误差模型，揭示了近似精度与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都基于计算不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在线性最小化Oracle(LMO)优化框架下引入加性误差模型，分析近似正交化更新的性能边界，量化LMO不精确度对性能的影响。

Result: 发现近似精度与最优步长和动量参数存在耦合：较低的Oracle精度需要更小的步长但更大的动量参数，近似过程成为必须与学习计划协同调优的关键参数。

Conclusion: 将近似过程从实现细节提升为关键参数，NanoGPT实验验证了预测的耦合关系，最优学习率随近似精度变化而明显偏移。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化问题，提出了两种基于f-差分隐私的隐私核算方法，能够更准确地捕捉稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关性噪声带来的隐私放大效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习允许用户在不共享数据给中央服务器的情况下协作，但由于存在复杂的算法组件（如去中心化通信和本地更新），准确量化隐私预算具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了两种新的f-DP核算方法：PN-f-DP（量化随机游走通信下用户对之间的隐私泄漏）和Sec-f-LDP（通过共享秘密支持结构化噪声注入），结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中工具。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，与基于Rényi DP的方法相比，本文方法产生更紧的(ε,δ)边界和更好的效用。

Conclusion: f-DP在去中心化隐私核算中具有优势，能够更准确地捕捉隐私放大效应，提供更严格的隐私保证。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了线性回归持续学习中的任务排序策略，重点关注贪婪最大化任务间差异性的排序方法，并与随机排序进行对比分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是深入探索持续学习中任务排序对学习性能的影响，特别是贪婪排序策略的有效性和局限性，这在先前研究中尚未充分探讨。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法工具，从几何和代数角度形式化贪婪排序策略，并在线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务上进行实证分析。

Result: 实证显示贪婪排序在平均损失收敛速度上优于随机排序；理论分析表明在高秩设置下两者性能相当，但在一般秩设置下，允许重复的贪婪排序收敛速度为O(1/∛k)，而单次贪婪排序可能失败。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了贪婪排序和随机排序之间的细微差别，表明任务排序策略在持续学习中具有重要影响，但需要根据具体场景选择合适的策略。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

TL;DR: 提出一种新型椭圆不确定性集合来处理金融强化学习中市场冲击的方向性问题，解决了传统鲁棒方法无法捕捉市场冲击方向性的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融强化学习代理在历史数据上训练时不会影响价格，但在实际部署时交易行为会产生市场冲击，这种训练与部署环境的不匹配会显著降低性能。

Method: 开发了一类椭圆不确定性集合，建立了最坏情况不确定性的隐式和显式闭式解，实现了高效可处理的鲁棒策略评估。

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务上的实验表明，该方法获得了更优的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的强化学习提供了更忠实和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无偏零阶梯度估计器，通过将方向导数重构为望远镜级数，从精心设计的分布中采样，消除了传统零阶优化方法中的梯度估计偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶优化方法存在梯度估计偏差问题，除非扰动步长趋近于零，这限制了优化性能。本文旨在克服这一偏差问题。

Method: 通过将方向导数重构为望远镜级数，从精心设计的分布中采样，构建无偏梯度估计器。分析了四种具体构造的理论性质，推导了最优缩放分布和扰动步长。

Conclusion: 成功开发了一种无偏零阶梯度估计器家族，解决了传统方法的偏差问题，在理论和实验上均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究两点零阶梯度估计器，发现当扰动步长趋于零时，最小化估计器渐近方差的扰动分布可以与真实梯度方向对齐，而非保持固定长度。提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，在理论和实证上均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度的随机扰动，但忽略了扰动方向与梯度方向对齐可能带来的优势。本文旨在探索这种方向对齐扰动的潜力，以提高梯度估计的准确性。

Method: 将问题表述为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，该方案能自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度的梯度估计。

Result: 理论分析表明DAP方案能有效降低梯度估计的渐近方差。在合成问题和实际任务上的实证评估显示，在特定条件下DAP优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 方向对齐的随机扰动在零阶优化中具有显著优势，DAP方案为随机梯度下降提供了更准确的梯度估计，扩展了现有复杂度界限的应用范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

TL;DR: UCAN提出了一种使用各向异性噪声的通用认证对抗鲁棒性方法，显著提升了现有随机平滑方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声分布，忽略了输入和数据维度的异质性，限制了鲁棒性认证的有效性。

Method: UCAN将现有随机平滑方法从对称（各向同性）噪声分布转换为非对称（各向异性）噪声分布，通过三个噪声参数生成器优化不同数据维度的噪声参数。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，UCAN在大认证半径下的认证准确率比现有最先进方法提升了高达182.6%。

Conclusion: UCAN通过各向异性噪声显著提升了对抗鲁棒性认证的性能，为机器学习模型提供了更有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了时间序列预测中的"长序列信息增益假设"，发现适当截断历史数据反而能提高预测精度，并提出AMRC方法通过动态掩码损失和表示一致性约束来抑制冗余特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型基于"长序列信息增益假设"，但研究发现现有模型在训练中学习大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），损害了有效信号提取能力。

Method: 提出AMRC方法：1）动态掩码损失 - 自适应识别高区分度时间片段来指导梯度下降；2）表示一致性约束 - 稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC有效抑制了冗余特征学习，显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时序建模的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MDLMs在数学和编程任务中相比传统左到右解码的实际优势，解决其额外计算成本与性能不匹配的问题。

Method: 提出推理填充方法，使用MDLMs填充推理模板来结构化输出；开发多令牌熵解码(MED)，基于条件熵自适应并行解码。

Result: 在GSM8k上，基于后验推理轨迹微调LLaDA-8B Base获得与人工推理轨迹相当的提升；MED保持性能同时减少2.7倍解码步骤。

Conclusion: MDLMs的训练和计算为推理和后训练方法开辟了新途径，证明了其独特价值。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

Motivation: RFID跟踪在国防资产存储中存在传感器特异性差的问题（如长距离检测、欺骗和伪造漏洞），可能导致错误检测和操作安全事件。

Method: 使用包含约98万条读取数据的真实RSSI数据集，采用决策树分类器，在CAD建模的平面图中进行监督学习模拟，通过计算类别权重处理类别不平衡问题，使用分层子样本训练模型。

Result: 模型在5000个平衡观测值上训练，总体准确率34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）的F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类。计算了邻接感知混淆矩阵以更好地解释物理相邻区域。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可以在现实模拟中应用，实现区域级异常检测或国防供应链中的错位监控。通过更好的天线布局或额外传感器及多模态传感器融合，可以改善低覆盖和低信号区域的可靠分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂多步任务中表现不佳，基于群体的RL算法（如GRPO）仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，导致有益和有害动作被混淆，造成训练不稳定和次优策略。

Method: 构建相同提示下的轨迹图，量化每个步骤的质量并分配优势值，作为即插即用模块与现有基于群体的RL算法集成，无需修改rollout过程且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SALT通过细粒度优势分配有效解决了基于群体RL算法的训练不稳定问题，为复杂多步任务提供了轻量级且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

TL;DR: 提出一种在线草稿模型选择算法，在推测解码中与最佳草稿模型竞争，显著提升推理加速效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推测解码中的在线草稿模型选择问题，提高大语言模型推理效率

Method: 设计在线学习算法，能够准确评估所有草稿模型而无需额外目标模型查询，适用于各种推测解码方法

Result: 在开源LLM和多样化数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最佳方法EAGLE3和BanditSpec基准

Conclusion: 该方法在需要长推理链的领域特别有效，能大幅减少计算和延迟开销

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

TL;DR: 研究核心加密资产流动性和波动率代理是否产生溢出效应来预测市场风险，通过多层统计框架发现显著的格兰杰因果关系和中等预测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索加密资产市场中的流动性和波动率溢出效应，以预测市场整体风险

Method: 集成三层统计框架：核心流动性与收益互动、主成分关系、波动率因子投影，辅以VAR模型、HAR-X模型和防泄漏机器学习协议

Result: 发现跨层的显著格兰杰因果关系，具有中等样本外预测准确性

Conclusion: 加密资产的流动性和波动率代理确实产生可预测市场风险的溢出效应

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

TL;DR: 提出耦合Transformer自编码器（CTAE），用于同时建模多脑区神经记录中的共享和区域特异性动态，解决了现有方法忽略时间结构或无法分离共享与私有信号的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略时间结构，要么局限于单脑区、线性假设，或无法分离共享与区域特异性信号，需要开发能同时处理非平稳非线性动态和信号分离的框架。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器-解码器架构捕获长程神经动态，将每个脑区的潜空间显式划分为正交的共享和私有子空间。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集（运动皮层和感觉区域）上验证，CTAE提取的表征能更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE能有效建模多脑区神经动态，分离共享与区域特异性信号，提供比现有方法更好的行为解码性能。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: ShapeX是一个创新的时间序列解释框架，通过识别关键shapelet（形状子序列）并使用Shapley值评估其重要性，提供比现有方法更精确和具有因果保真度的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的时间序列分类后解释方法主要关注时间步级别的特征归因，忽视了分类结果主要由关键shapelet驱动的基本先验知识，这限制了在医疗和金融等高风险应用中的透明度和可信度。

Method: ShapeX包含Shapelet Describe-and-Detect（SDD）框架，能够学习对分类至关重要的多样化shapelet集合，并将时间序列分割为有意义的shapelet驱动片段，然后使用Shapley值评估这些片段的显著性。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，ShapeX在识别最相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精度和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过利用shapelet的原子性特性，能够产生揭示因果关系而不仅仅是相关性的解释，为高风险应用中的时间序列分类模型提供了更可靠和透明的解释框架。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动检测系统面临类别严重不平衡、发帖模式时序复杂性、风险级别兼具序数和分类双重性质等挑战。

Method: 使用分层双头神经网络：CORAL头保持风险级别间序数关系，标准分类头实现灵活分类；3层Transformer编码器建模时序依赖，显式时间间隔嵌入捕捉发帖动态；组合损失函数（0.5 CORAL + 0.3 交叉熵 + 0.2 Focal Loss）同时处理序数结构保持、过度自信减少和类别不平衡；冻结MentalRoBERTa前6层并使用混合精度训练提高效率。

Result: 使用5折分层交叉验证评估，以宏观F1分数为主要指标。

Conclusion: 该模型通过双头架构有效平衡了自杀风险分类中的序数关系和分类灵活性，同时解决了类别不平衡和时序建模等关键挑战。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

TL;DR: 提出基于博弈论强化学习的因果发现框架，通过DDQN智能体与强基线方法(GES/GraN-DAG)竞争，实现理论保证与可扩展性的统一


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在理论与实践的鸿沟：GES和GraN-DAG等算法经验性能强但缺乏有限样本保证，而理论方法无法扩展到大规模问题

Method: 设计博弈论强化学习框架，DDQN智能体直接与强基线方法竞争，总是从对手解开始热启动，确保学习图不差于对手且加速收敛

Result: 在合成SEM(30节点)上观察到的错误概率随样本量n衰减，与理论紧密匹配；在真实基准数据集上持续改进GES和GraN-DAG，可扩展到Hepar2(70节点)、Dream(100节点)、Andes(220节点)等大图

Conclusion: 建立了同时具备可证明一致性、样本高效性和实际可扩展性的RL因果发现算法新类别，标志着经验性能与严格有限样本理论的统一

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多维样本的模式分类中，基于权重的维度距离度量很重要，但常用的欧氏距离存在诸多问题。需要开发更有效的距离度量和维度加权方案来改进分类性能。

Method: 提出了新的维度加权方案，并将其整合到KNN分类器中，使用加权Minkowski距离来调节包含k个参考样本区域的形状和大小。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现良好，特别是在基因表达数据集上，所有交叉验证实验中均获得显著且一致的分类准确率提升（约10%）。

Conclusion: 该方法是对传统KNN分类器的重要泛化，通过加权Minkowski距离和新的加权方案，在高维小样本数据集中能够更有效地选择最近邻。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

TL;DR: 提出完全解耦训练策略解决原型自监督学习中的原型坍塌问题，通过分离原型和编码器的优化目标，使用在线EM风格过程更新原型，无需显式正则化即可获得多样化原型和更好的下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在原型坍塌问题，多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这破坏了提供多样化目标来指导编码器学习丰富表示的核心目的。现有方法通过过度参数化原型集或添加临时正则化来缓解症状而非解决根本原因。

Method: 引入完全解耦训练策略，将原型和编码器在不同目标下分别学习。具体将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格过程独立于编码器损失进行更新。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型坍塌，无需显式正则化即可获得一致多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型坍塌的根本原因，提供了一种更有效的原型自监督学习方法。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Motivation: 时间序列基础模型表现不如轻量监督基线和经典模型，根源在于生搬硬套NLP/CV的数据收集范式，而时间序列数据缺乏概念密度和语义完整性。

Method: 提出从机会主义数据聚合转向原则性设计，基于时间序列不变性的第一原理构建系统化覆盖不变性空间的数据集。

Result: 论证了当前时间序列基础模型的局限性，提出了基于不变性原则的数据集构建新范式。

Conclusion: 只有通过系统化覆盖不变性空间来确保表征完整性，时间序列基础模型才能实现真正的泛化、推理和涌现行为。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多层图扩散模型发现，阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白的传播受到结构连接和功能连接的不对称影响，且这种主导作用在疾病不同阶段会发生变化，并与AD相关基因表达模式高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累，表明大规模网络架构在阿尔茨海默病进展中起关键作用，但结构连接和功能连接如何相互作用影响tau传播尚不清楚。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型研究SC-FC相互作用，并在独立AD队列中验证结果。

Result: FC主要在皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层驱动tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域作用更大。SC和FC的相对主导作用在疾病过程中发生变化，早期AD中FC占主导，后期SC成为主要因素。

Conclusion: 结构连接和功能连接对tau传播的区域性不对称贡献与AD相关基因表达模式高度一致，非可改变风险因素和生物机制通过区域特异性方式重塑tau传播路径。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

Motivation: 现有使用固定方差噪声的去中心化学习方法会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要一种能动态调整噪声和学习率的自适应方法。

Method: 采用步进衰减策略动态调整噪声方差和学习率，引入渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度，结合去中心化push-sum和聚合技术，适用于时变通信拓扑。

Result: 理论分析证明ADP-VRSGP在适当学习率下实现鲁棒收敛，实验验证在多种场景下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP有效解决了隐私保护去中心化学习中的挑战，显著提升了训练稳定性和速度。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

Motivation: 解决神经方法在大规模TSP实例中的扩展性问题，包括内存约束、初始解质量不足和全局引导不充分等挑战。

Method: 采用"先聚类后路由"策略，使用稀疏热图图将TSP实例划分为簇并抽象为超节点，生成超导览来指导初始化和优化过程，聚焦与超导览相关的边。

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超导览引导的邻域搜索有效解决了大规模TSP问题，提供了更高效和有效的优化方案。

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

TL;DR: RLEV方法通过将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，扩展了RLVR框架，使LLM优化与可量化的人类价值信号对齐，在多个RL算法和模型规模上持续优于仅基于正确性的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RLVR在客观领域使用二元正确性奖励有效训练模型，但它忽略了并非所有任务都同等重要。RLEV旨在通过将人类价值信号直接纳入奖励函数来解决这个问题。

Method: 使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，通过价值加权梯度放大在序列结束标记上学习价值敏感的终止策略。

Result: RLEV策略不仅提高了价值加权准确性，还学习了价值敏感的终止策略：对低价值提示简洁，对高价值提示详尽。消融研究证实增益与价值对齐存在因果关系。

Conclusion: RLEV在噪声价值信号（如基于难度的标签）下保持稳健，表明优化显式效用函数为将LLM与人类优先级对齐提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用提供了有效的风险感知约束强化学习解决方案，具有良好的理论保证和实际性能。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

### [121] [Approximate Replicability in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20200)
*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种可复制性的松弛概念：点态可复制性、近似可复制性和半可复制性，并在这些松弛条件下实现了样本最优的不可知PAC学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性在简单任务（如阈值学习）中不可实现，本文旨在探索在何种近似可复制性概念下学习是可行的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性松弛：(1)点态可复制性：在固定输入上一致；(2)近似可复制性：对大部分分布分类一致；(3)半可复制性：完全可复制但可使用共享无标签样本。

Result: 在常数可复制性参数下，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：(1)和(2)使用Θ(d/α²)样本即可实现，(3)需要Θ(d²/α²)标记样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当松弛可复制性要求，可以在不显著增加样本复杂度的情况下实现稳定的学习算法。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

### [122] [Assessing the Feasibility of Early Cancer Detection Using Routine Laboratory Data: An Evaluation of Machine Learning Approaches on an Imbalanced Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20209)
*Shumin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究评估了使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列的常规实验室数据进行癌症风险分类的可行性，发现虽然存在统计学上可检测的癌症信号，但信号太弱且与正常衰老或其他炎症状况混淆，无法实现可靠的临床分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发用于犬类早期癌症检测的无创筛查工具是兽医医学的重要挑战，常规实验室数据提供了低成本来源，但受到个体生物标志物非特异性和筛查人群中严重类别不平衡的限制。

Method: 在金毛猎犬寿命研究队列上进行了全面基准评估，系统比较了126个分析流程，包括各种机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，使用患者级数据分区防止泄漏。

Result: 最佳模型（带类别加权的逻辑回归分类器和递归特征消除）显示出中等排名能力（AUROC = 0.815），但临床分类性能差（F1分数 = 0.25，阳性预测值 = 0.15），阴性预测值高（0.98）但召回率不足（0.79）。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在的癌症信号太弱且混淆，无法实现可靠的临床区分，这为该数据模态单独使用设定了关键性能上限，计算兽医肿瘤学的有意义的进展需要多模态数据源的整合。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

<details>

Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异质性下表现不佳，其基于数据量的启发式聚合方法无法准确评估客户端更新的实际效用和可靠性，导致次优个性化和聚合偏差。

Method: CO-PFL算法通过分析梯度方向差异和预测偏差来联合评估客户端贡献，利用梯度和数据子空间信息进行双子空间分析，并结合参数级个性化机制和掩码感知动量优化。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR10C、CINIC10和Mini-ImageNet四个基准数据集上的实验表明，CO-PFL在个性化精度、鲁棒性、可扩展性和收敛稳定性方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CO-PFL通过动态贡献评估和参数级个性化机制，有效缓解了聚合偏差，增强了全局协调能力，并通过构建具有稳定更新的定制子模型提升了本地性能。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谱聚类算法在融入群体公平性约束时计算效率较低，需要改进算法运行时间。

Method: 使用拉格朗日方法和SMW恒等式重新构建优化问题，基于拉普拉斯矩阵的三种变体生成多个Fair-SMW算法变体。

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet等真实网络数据集上测试，计算时间比现有最优方法快两倍，同时能实现两倍的平衡度。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平聚类质量的同时，显著提升了计算效率，为公平聚类提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列预测任务中，类别信息对捕捉数据内在模式至关重要，但传统注意力机制未能充分利用此类信息。

Method: 扩展传统QKV注意力框架为QKCV，引入静态类别嵌入C，作为即插即用模块增强注意力模型，支持仅更新静态嵌入的轻量级微调。

Result: QKCV显著提升了多种注意力模型在真实数据集上的预测精度，并在微调单变量基础模型时减少计算开销并取得优越性能。

Conclusion: QKCV是有效的时间序列预测增强模块，通过整合类别信息提升模型性能，同时提供高效的微调策略。

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,

demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在非IID数据下存在模型过拟合和本地模型发散的问题，需要改进模型个性化能力

Conclusion: MetaVD能有效压缩本地模型参数，缓解模型过拟合并降低通信成本，为联邦学习中的模型个性化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LKM的自知识蒸馏方法，能够显著提升图神经网络在分子性质预测中的准确性，同时几乎不增加计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络是目前预测分子性质最有效的方法，但需要更高的准确性。虽然增加模型复杂度可以提高准确性，但会显著增加计算成本和内存需求。

Method: 开发了层到层知识混合(LKM)方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，改善局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: 在三个不同GNN架构(DimeNet++、MXMNet、PAMNet)和量子化学性质数据集(QM9、MD17、Chignolin)上评估，LKM将量子化学和生物物理性质预测的平均绝对误差分别降低了9.8%、45.3%和22.9%。

Conclusion: LKM方法能够在不大幅增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学性质预测中的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了选择性分类差距的概念，将理想oracle性能与实际选择性分类器性能之间的差距分解为五个来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实现/分布偏移引起的松弛。研究发现单调后校准对缩小这一差距影响有限，真正需要的是能够重新排序预测的评分机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择性分类器通过拒绝不确定输入来提高模型可靠性，但很少有方法能达到完美排序oracle的性能。本文旨在形式化这种性能差距，并分析其根本原因。

Method: 提出了选择性分类差距的有限样本分解框架，将差距分解为五个具体误差源。在合成数据和真实视觉、语言基准上进行验证，通过受控实验分离每个误差分量。

Result: 验证结果显示：(i)贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量会造成显著差距；(ii)只有更丰富的特征感知校准器能显著改善评分排序；(iii)数据偏移引入的松弛需要分布鲁棒训练。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了定量误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助实践者构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

Conclusion: FedGPS通过整合统计分布和梯度信息，成功解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，在各种异构场景下表现出色，是一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策标准，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，指导行为基础模型在测试时通过环境交互进行任务推断，实现少量回合内识别和优化未见奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行为基础模型需要计算推理数据集上的奖励，这需要访问奖励函数形式或大量标注工作。本文旨在通过测试时与环境交互来缓解这些限制，实现纯粹通过交互的任务推断。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM乐观决策标准，直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，引导BFMs进行任务推断的数据收集。该方法与线性bandits的上置信界算法有直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的BFMs能够在少量回合内以最小计算开销识别和优化未见奖励函数。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为训练良好的BFMs提供了遗憾界限，通过乐观决策标准有效解决了零样本强化学习中任务推断的数据效率问题。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个基准框架，用于系统性地测量LLM代理利用测试用例的倾向性，通过创建任务的自然语言规范与单元测试之间的直接冲突来量化"作弊率"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找和利用"捷径"完成任务，这会严重影响评估的可靠性和实际部署的安全性，比如删除失败的测试而不是修复底层错误。

Method: 通过从现有基准（如LiveCodeBench和SWE-bench）创建"不可能"任务变体，引入规范与测试之间的直接冲突，测量代理在这些任务上的通过率作为作弊率。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂运算符重载的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环如何影响作弊率，并提供了已验证的欺骗解决方案测试平台。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench作为一个实用框架，有助于构建更稳健可靠的LLM系统，可用于研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Method: 针对Ampere GPU优化的CUDA内核，使用128B合并访问和分层共享内存累加；PyTorch层通过可微分欧拉特征变换风格的sigmoid松弛学习单方向阈值。

Result: 在合成网格上比之前的GPU实现快16-2000倍；实现了可微分计算，支持端到端学习。

Conclusion: 优化后的GPU内核和可微分层为拓扑特征在深度学习中的广泛应用铺平了道路，讨论了批处理和多GPU扩展以扩大采用范围。

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

### [135] [Limits of PRM-Guided Tree Search for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20272)
*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中并未显著优于Best-of-N选择，且成本更高，表明当前的过程奖励模型可靠性不足，需要不同的奖励建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的链式思维提示与Best-of-N选择方法无法捕捉复杂问题解决的分支和探索性质，因此研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能改善数学推理。

Method: 提出自适应算法最大化过程奖励模型分数，使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct及其相关PRM作为案例研究，在23个数学问题上评估PRM引导的树搜索方法。

Result: PRM引导的树搜索相比BoN无显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和束搜索表现最佳；PRM对状态值近似差且可靠性随推理深度下降；PRM泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠PRM分数依赖过大，需要不同的奖励建模方法才能有效提升LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在标准基准数据集上表现良好，但在实际应用中性能不稳定，这归因于黑盒架构和现有评估框架的局限性，无法清晰量化不同模型的具体优缺点。

Method: 使用合成数据驱动的评估范式，通过三个核心分析维度：时间特征分解与能力映射、数据不规则情况下的鲁棒性分析、理论最优基准测试。

Result: 实验表明当前的深度学习模型在所有类型的时间特征上并未普遍接近最优基准。

Conclusion: SynTSBench提供了一个可解释的评估系统，能够系统评估预测模型的具体能力，帮助选择合适的模型用于特定预测场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

*Guangyu Dai,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于KAN的协作模型(KCM)来改进大-小模型协作框架，在保持任务准确性的同时显著减少大模型推理调用，降低计算资源消耗，并缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大-小模型协作框架存在的准确性下降、灾难性遗忘加剧、小模型知识引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 使用KAN(可解释神经网络)作为协作模型替代传统MLP，在语言、视觉和视觉-语言跨模态任务中部署KCM协作系统。

Result: 相比纯大模型方法，KCM协作框架显著减少大模型推理调用次数，保持相近任务准确性，大幅降低计算资源消耗，同时显著缓解灾难性遗忘，提升长尾数据准确性。

Conclusion: KCM在所有指标上均优于基于MLP的小协作模型(MCM)，为大-小模型协作提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Motivation: 构建能够协助整个科学研究过程的AI协作系统，需要评估端到端工作流程而非孤立子任务的基准

Method: 从14kCC授权论文构建CS-54k科学问答语料库，使用检索增强生成和多阶段质量控制确保事实基础

Result: CS-4k将最先进LLM分层为不同能力层级，在CS-50k上训练的7B模型超越GPT-4.1等更大专有系统

Conclusion: 使AI模型成为更好研究助手更依赖于高质量数据的领域对齐训练，而非预训练规模或通用基准性能

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试上，该方法在图形泛化方面持续优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: 提出的IRM-free方法能够有效识别因果子图，在无需环境标注的情况下实现更好的分布外泛化性能

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Motivation: 解决深度学习脑肿瘤分类方法过度依赖数据增强导致泛化能力受限和临床可信度不足的问题，旨在开发无需增强、可解释且可部署的可靠模型。

Method: 采用VGG16和Xception双主干网络架构，集成频率门控注意力(FGA)模块捕捉互补的局部和全局特征，结合Grad-CAM实现肿瘤区域可视化。

Result: 在7K-DS数据集上，4类、3类和2类分类准确率分别达到99.24%、98.68%和99.85%；在独立3K-DS数据集上泛化准确率为95.77%，均优于基线方法和现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net等无需增强、可解释且可部署的深度学习模型在脑肿瘤诊断中具有可靠的临床转化潜力，通过GUI界面支持实时分类和肿瘤定位。

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

### [141] [InvDec: Inverted Decoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Separated Temporal and Variate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20302)
*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InvDec混合架构，结合基于patch的时间编码器和变量级解码器，通过延迟变量嵌入和自适应残差融合机制，在保持时间特征完整性的同时有效建模变量间依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：通道独立方法如PatchTST擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法如iTransformer牺牲了时间编码。需要一种能同时建模时间模式和跨变量依赖的解决方案。

Method: InvDec采用混合架构：1)基于patch的时间编码器进行时间建模；2)倒置解码器通过变量级自注意力处理变量维度；3)延迟变量嵌入在时间编码后丰富变量特定表示；4)自适应残差融合机制动态平衡时间和变量信息。

Result: 在7个基准测试上表现优异，高维数据集上显著提升：电力数据集MSE降低20.9%，天气数据集提升4.3%，交通数据集提升2.7%，同时在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力。消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: InvDec通过分离时间编码和变量级解码，有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的关键挑战。分析表明其优势随数据集维度增加而增强，证实跨变量建模在变量数量增加时变得至关重要。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

Motivation: 现实世界隐私保护需求涉及多个敏感属性且动态变化，现有单属性遗忘方法无法同时处理多个遗忘请求和适应动态需求。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和三个代表性推荐模型上的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: LEGO框架通过理论保证和高效设计，成功解决了多属性动态遗忘的挑战，为推荐系统隐私保护提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Conclusion: 通过控制图像生成和真实与合成数据的整合，结合定制域适应策略，可以有效解决关键应用中训练数据不足的问题。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了奖励模型泛化能力不足和LLM评判器成本高昂的问题，为在线RLHF提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Motivation: 现有层次预测方法需要估计协方差矩阵，但真实协方差矩阵未知，估计误差会降低预测性能。

Method: 引入协方差矩阵的不确定性集合，构建鲁棒优化框架，将协调问题转化为半定优化问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法具有更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 将不确定性整合到协调过程中能有效提升层次时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

TL;DR: 提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过RBP指标衡量正确标记在top预测中的排名概率，补充了传统交叉熵指标的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只关注正确标记的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误标记之间的相对排序，而相对排序在语言模型中至关重要。

Method: 提出相对基于概率（RBP）指标，量化正确标记在top预测中的排名概率，并基于此建立相对基于缩放定律，通过四个数据集和四个模型家族的广泛实验验证其鲁棒性和准确性。

Result: 实验证明相对基于缩放定律能够准确描述RBP随模型规模增加而改善的规律，该定律具有鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 相对基于缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大规模语言模型的缩放提供了更完整的理解，对实际开发和理论探索都具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Motivation: 工业过程控制需要局部专业化和全局协调，但强化学习的工业应用面临奖励设计、模块化和动作空间管理等挑战。现有学术基准与工业控制问题差异较大，限制了向实际应用的迁移。

Method: 结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym两个现有基准，构建顺序回收场景（包含分类和压制操作）。评估两种控制策略：模块化架构（专用代理）和集中式架构（单一代理控制全系统），并分析动作掩码的影响。

Result: 无动作掩码时，代理难以学习有效策略，模块化架构表现更好。应用动作掩码后，两种架构均有显著改善，性能差距大幅缩小。

Conclusion: 动作空间约束在工业自动化中具有决定性作用，专业化优势随动作复杂度降低而减弱。该基准为探索实用稳健的多代理强化学习解决方案提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

*Aditya Gopalan,Sayak Ray Chowdhury,Debangshu Banerjee*

TL;DR: 本文分析了DPO算法的局限性，提出了AuxDPO方法来缓解DPO的模型设定错误问题，并在实验中验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO算法虽然简化了RLHF流程，但当真实奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时会出现模型设定错误，导致偏好顺序反转、策略奖励恶化等问题。

Method: 通过几何分析两阶段RLHF的局部行为，提出AuxDPO方法，在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量，以更接近RLHF解的方式缓解设定错误。

Result: 在示例赌博机设置和LLM对齐任务中，AuxDPO表现出优于DPO的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO通过引入辅助变量有效缓解了DPO的模型设定错误问题，为直接对齐算法提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中事件标记分布高度不平衡，现有研究忽略了这一点，导致对稀有标记事件的预测性能不佳。

Method: 提出阈值方法学习阈值来调整标记概率，先预测标记再预测时间，开发了支持有效时间采样和概率估计的神经MTPP模型。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在下一事件标记和时间预测方面优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案通过处理标记不平衡问题，显著提升了下一事件预测的性能，特别是对稀有标记事件的预测。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code
is available at https://github.com/undes1red/IFNMTPP.

Motivation: 药物组合虽然有益但存在药物相互作用风险，现有方法依赖孤立药物表示，无法显式建模原子级跨分子交互，限制了在不同分子复杂度和DDI类型分布下的效果

Method: 构建包含药物对原子结构的联合图，引入结构一致性模块迭代优化节点特征同时保持全局结构上下文，有效学习局部和全局交互模式

Conclusion: 细粒度图优化方法显著提高了DDI事件预测的准确性、鲁棒性和机制可解释性，为Web挖掘和内容分析中的药物相互作用网络分析提供了图基方法

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 系统分析LLM修复中的样本优先级策略，发现提出的SAPS方法在解毒、效用保持和效率之间达到最佳平衡，随机采样对大型模型仍有效，而高开销方法收益有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在现实系统中部署时会产生有毒或有偏见的输出，影响安全和信任。参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性使用修复数据，但尚不清楚哪些采样标准对大型生成模型的行为修复最有效。

Method: 评估五种代表性选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、梯度范数选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)和提出的语义感知优先级采样(SAPS)，通过毒性减少、困惑度和三个复合指标评估修复效果。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率方面达到最佳平衡，用更少数据获得相当或更好的修复结果。随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍有效，而CCS和GraNd等高开销方法收益有限。

Conclusion: 基于选择的修复是维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范式，最优数据比例取决于模型规模和修复方法，样本选择应被视为修复管道中的可调组件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对图像水印系统的伪造攻击方法，通过训练偏好模型来检测水印，并利用反向传播优化实现水印的移除和伪造，无需了解水印模型的具体实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型和法律压力的增加，数字内容水印技术日益重要。虽然已有许多研究评估水印对移除攻击的鲁棒性，但水印伪造（即从真实内容中窃取水印并应用于恶意内容）的研究仍然不足。

Method: 1. 引入偏好模型来评估图像是否包含水印，使用排名损失在纯程序生成的图像上进行训练，无需真实水印数据；2. 通过反向传播优化输入图像来移除和伪造水印，仅需单张水印图像且无需了解水印模型细节。

Result: 在多种后处理图像水印模型上的评估表明，该方法能有效伪造水印，质疑了当前水印方法的安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了水印伪造攻击，仅需单张水印图像即可工作，无需了解水印模型，对当前水印系统的安全性提出了挑战。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

TL;DR: 提出Hurdle-IMDL框架解决遥感降雨反演中的标签不平衡问题，通过分解为零膨胀和长尾分布两部分，分别用hurdle模型和逆模型去偏学习处理，显著提升了强降雨反演性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在定量遥感中面临标签分布不平衡的挑战，传统训练模型偏向常见样本，导致稀有样本（如强降雨）的反演性能下降。

Method: 采用分治策略：1）用hurdle模型处理零膨胀（非降雨样本主导）；2）提出IMDL方法处理长尾分布（轻降雨样本过多），将学习目标转化为无偏的理想逆模型。

Result: 通过统计指标和案例研究验证，Hurdle-IMDL优于传统、代价敏感、生成和多任务学习方法，有效缓解系统性低估，显著改善强到极端降雨的反演性能。

Conclusion: IMDL为处理环境变量分布不平衡提供了通用方法，能够增强对稀有但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种图神经网络方法，通过时间有向图显式建模网球比赛中的不可传递性关系，发现在高不可传递性比赛中存在市场低效，利用该模型进行选择性投注可获得3.26%的正回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网球比赛中普遍存在不可传递的玩家优势关系（A胜B、B胜C但C胜A），但现有预测方法很少尝试将其纳入考虑。作者旨在解决这一问题，探索如何有效捕捉这些复杂的不可传递关系。

Method: 使用图神经网络方法，将玩家作为节点，历史比赛结果作为有向边，构建时间有向图来显式建模不可传递关系。

Result: 发现博彩公司Pinnacle Sports在处理高不可传递性比赛时表现不佳。使用该模型在高不可传递性比赛中进行选择性投注，准确率达到65.7%，Brier得分为0.215，在1903次投注中获得了3.26%的投资回报率。

Conclusion: 图神经网络方法能够有效捕捉网球比赛中的关系动态，特别是在处理不可传递性比赛场景时具有独特优势，表明市场在处理不可传递性比赛对时存在低效性，该模型成功利用了这种低效性。

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

Method: 研究了七种不同的重布线策略，分析重布线对局部和全局图属性的影响，并将这些变化与节点分类准确率相关联。

Result: 结果显示一致的模式：成功的重布线方法倾向于保留局部结构，同时允许全局连接性的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重布线策略提供了新见解，弥合了图理论与实际GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Conclusion: Bi-CoG是一种简单有效的即插即用方法，通过双一致性引导和动态伪标签分配，有效解决了半监督微调中的关键问题。

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Motivation: 传统多模态对齐方法假设所有模态间存在相互冗余，这在现实分布式场景中不成立。需要一种不依赖模态间完全冗余的新方法。

Method: 使用层结构建模模态对关系，采用分散式对比学习目标进行训练，在多比较空间中实现对齐。

Result: 在多模态感知数据集上表现出优异的零样本泛化能力、跨模态对齐效果和模态缺失鲁棒性，通信成本比现有最佳方法降低50%。

Conclusion: SheafAlign框架成功克服了传统方法的局限性，无需模态间相互冗余，同时保留了共享和独特信息。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了将MLOps实践集成到运营技术(OT)系统中的挑战，提出了使用RAMI 4.0和ISA-95等参考模型的系统集成方法，并通过实际用例展示了MLOps生命周期组件在RAMI 4.0中的映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLOps在工业环境中的广泛应用，其与OT系统的集成面临显著挑战，需要解决两者之间的兼容性问题。

Method: 评估RAMI 4.0和ISA-95标准对MLOps集成的适用性，提出系统化方法将MLOps实践嵌入现有OT参考模型，并通过实际用例详细展示MLOps组件在RAMI 4.0中的映射。

Result: 研究发现标准MLOps实践不能直接移植到OT环境，但通过使用现有参考模型进行结构化适配，可以为成功集成提供可行路径。

Conclusion: 虽然MLOps与OT系统的集成存在挑战，但通过基于现有参考模型的结构化方法可以实现有效集成，为工业环境中的MLOps应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in
industrial settings, yet their integration with Opera- tional Technology (OT)
systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic
approach to embed MLOps prac- tices into established OT reference models. We
evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0
(RAMI 4.0) and the International Society of Automation Standard 95 (ISA-95) for
MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM)方法，解决生存分析中的算法偏见问题，特别关注组内和跨组风险排序公平性，在乳腺癌预后应用中显著提升公平性同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗保健中的应用日益增多，但临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见可能被数据驱动模型延续甚至放大。在生存分析中，删失和时间动态性进一步增加了公平模型开发的复杂性。算法公平性方法往往忽视跨组排名差异，这可能导致高风险黑人患者排名低于低风险白人患者，强化生物本质主义并损害公平护理。

Method: 提出Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM)框架，旨在减轻算法偏见，特别关注组内和跨组风险排序的时间维度公平性。使用乳腺癌预后作为代表性案例，将FASM应用于SEER乳腺癌数据。

Result: FASM显著提高了公平性，同时保持了与不考虑公平性的生存模型相当的判别性能。时间分层评估显示FASM在10年时间范围内保持稳定的公平性，在随访中期观察到最大的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法使得生存模型能够在临床决策中同时优先考虑准确性和公平性，将公平性作为临床护理的核心原则向前推进。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

TL;DR: 本文对随机梯度下降(SGD)在期望平滑性(ES)条件下的收敛性进行了系统分析，改进了ES条件的解释和常数设定，推导了全梯度范数的期望界，并证明了不同步长策略下的O(1/K)收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖于过强(有界方差)或过粗糙(均匀噪声)的假设，期望平滑性条件提供了更灵活的替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 通过细化期望平滑性条件的解释和采样相关常数，推导全梯度范数平方的期望界，并分析不同步长策略下的收敛性。

Result: 证明了在期望平滑性条件下，SGD具有O(1/K)的收敛速率，并给出了显式的残差误差项。

Conclusion: 该分析统一并扩展了近期相关工作，为SGD在更一般条件下的收敛性提供了完整的理论框架。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Motivation: 成瘾治疗场所决策对患者治疗效果和资源利用至关重要，但缺乏专业治疗资源，且现有方法面临数据集严重类别不平衡的问题

Method: 使用图神经网络框架，将治疗场所预测形式化为结构化学习问题，进行广泛特征工程，并提出获取无偏元图的新方法来训练GNN以克服类别不平衡

Result: 在真实数据上的实验结果显示，与竞争基线相比，少数类别的F1分数提高了11-35%

Conclusion: GRACE框架能有效解决成瘾治疗场所预测中的类别不平衡问题，显著提升预测性能

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spikachu是一个基于脉冲神经网络的可扩展、因果且能量高效的神经解码框架，在非人灵长类动物实验中表现优于因果基线方法，能耗降低2.26-418.81倍，同时支持多会话训练和少样本迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的神经解码方法存在两个问题：简单的因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂的非因果模型虽能泛化但不适合实时使用，且都依赖高能耗的人工神经网络。脉冲神经网络因其因果性和低能耗特性成为理想替代方案。

Method: 提出Spikachu框架，直接处理分箱的脉冲信号，将其投影到共享潜在空间，通过适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取相关特征，然后整合这些潜在表示并解码生成行为预测。

Result: 在6只非人灵长类动物的113个记录会话（总计43小时）上评估，该方法在单会话训练中优于因果基线，能耗降低2.26-418.81倍。多会话和跨主体训练能提升性能并实现少样本迁移到未见会话、主体和任务。

Conclusion: Spikachu提供了一个基于脉冲神经网络的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，其性能与最先进模型相当，同时能耗大幅降低。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

TL;DR: MS-BART是一个统一建模框架，通过大规模预训练将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表中，解决质谱数据稀缺问题，在多个关键指标上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质谱在分子识别中至关重要，但由于标注谱图稀缺，从质谱数据中解析结构仍然具有挑战性。现有的大规模预训练方法难以直接应用于质谱领域，因为原始谱信号复杂且异质性强。

Method: 提出MS-BART框架：1）将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表；2）通过大规模预训练进行跨模态学习；3）多任务预训练目标（去噪和翻译）；4）使用MIST生成指纹预测进行微调；5）引入化学反馈机制减少分子幻觉。

Result: 在MassSpecGym和NPLIB1的12个关键指标中，MS-BART在5个指标上达到SOTA性能，比基于扩散的竞争方法快一个数量级，消融实验验证了模型的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MS-BART通过统一的跨模态预训练框架成功解决了质谱数据稀缺问题，在分子结构解析任务中表现出色，为质谱分析提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种新颖的异常预测方法，从传统的异常检测转向异常预测，使用N-BEATS模型和图神经网络(GNN)进行时间序列预测，GNN在性能和效率方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造过程复杂且精度要求高，传统多变量时间序列分析面临高维度数据、类别不平衡和变量间复杂依赖关系的挑战，需要从异常检测发展到异常预测以实现实时过程校正和主动故障预防。

Method: 提出两阶段异常预测框架：(1)在无异常数据集上训练预测模型；(2)对新时间序列进行预测并与训练信号预测比较，超出阈值的偏差标记为异常。使用两种预测模型：基于变量独立假设的N-BEATS模型和考虑变量间关系的GNN模型。

Result: 两种模型在20个时间点范围内都表现出强大的预测性能，在50个时间点内保持稳定的异常预测。GNN模型在性能上始终优于N-BEATS模型，且需要更少的可训练参数和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: GNN模型作为有前景的在线异常预测解决方案，适合部署在制造环境中，能够有效处理半导体制造中的复杂多变量时间序列分析挑战。

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：裁剪边界C和批次大小B。研究发现当前理论（强隐私需要更小的C）与实证结果（强隐私下更大的C表现更好）存在不匹配，并揭示了现有批次大小调优启发式方法失效的原因。


<details>

Motivation: 差分隐私迁移学习是隐私约束下训练大模型的最先进方法，但当前对关键超参数C和B的理论理解与实证结果存在矛盾，需要深入分析这些参数的实际影响机制。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化、将裁剪视为梯度重加权形式、检查累积DP噪声，研究C和B在不同隐私约束和计算预算下的影响。假设固定计算预算（固定epoch数）进行分析。

Result: 发现梯度分布变化导致理论预测与实证结果不匹配；累积DP噪声能更好解释批次大小选择；跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置会导致次优性能，特别是在隐私约束松紧和计算资源多寡变化时性能下降明显。

Conclusion: 需要重新审视差分隐私迁移学习中的超参数选择策略，考虑梯度分布变化和累积DP噪声的影响，避免跨任务使用单一参数设置，特别是在不同隐私约束和计算预算场景下。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决特征学习中显著特征提取和鲁棒性问题，作者提出通过显式分解显著和非显著特征到不同空间的方法，旨在学习更具任务相关性和鲁棒性的低维特征表示。

Method: 提出H-SPLID算法，将输入特征显式分解为显著和非显著两个子空间，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)来约束表示与输入之间的关系，并理论证明预测偏差受显著子空间维度和HSIC值的上界约束。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实证评估表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入组件，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动表现出较低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID成功建立了鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系，通过特征分解方法有效提升了模型的鲁棒性和特征表示的质量，为学习任务相关的低维特征提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

TL;DR: DiRecGNN是一个用于微软云服务监控的注意力增强实体推荐框架，通过构建监控异构图，使用多头注意力机制和随机游走路径采样来捕获长程依赖关系，显著提升了推荐性能。


<details>

Conclusion: DiRecGNN框架在云服务监控推荐任务中表现出色，能够有效解决传统方法在捕获长程依赖和异质信息方面的局限性，得到了实际部署的验证。

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文推导了一个新的、紧致的、可处理的Jensen-Shannon散度(JSD)与Kullback-Leibler散度(KLD)之间的下界，证明了最大化JSD能够增加互信息(MI)的保证下界，为基于判别学习的MI表示学习提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然互信息是表示学习中的基本统计依赖度量，但直接优化往往难以处理。许多方法转而最大化替代依赖度量如JSD，但这些替代目标与MI的关系仍不清楚。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 推导了JSD与KLD之间新的紧致下界，并将其特化到联合分布和边缘分布的情况。通过最小化二元分类器的交叉熵损失来实际实现JSD目标，恢复JSD的已知变分下界。

Result: 实验表明该下界在MI估计中表现紧致，相比现有最先进的神经估计器，能够提供稳定、低方差的MI紧致下界估计。在信息瓶颈框架中也展示了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 研究结果为使用判别学习进行基于MI的表示学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力的实证证据，证明了最大化JSD确实能够增加MI的保证下界。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

TL;DR: xTime是一个用于时间序列极端事件预测的新框架，通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制，显著提升了极端事件的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列中的极端事件（如洪水、热浪、医疗急症）具有重大实际影响，但现有模型因数据不平衡和忽略中间事件信息而难以准确预测这些事件。

Method: 提出xTime框架，利用知识蒸馏从低稀有度事件模型中转移信息，并引入专家混合机制动态选择和融合不同稀有度级别的专家模型输出。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，xTime对极端事件的预测准确率从3%提升到78%。

Conclusion: xTime通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制有效解决了极端事件预测中的数据不平衡问题，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

TL;DR: 提出了一个混合贝叶斯专家混合框架，融合物理路径损耗模型和卷积神经网络，通过对数线性池化来改进GNSS干扰源定位和接收信号强度场重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中容易受到干扰，现有数据驱动方法在定位方面表现尚可但信号强度场重建较差，主要受限于空间上下文信息不足。

Method: 使用贝叶斯混合专家框架，结合物理路径损耗模型（确保物理一致性）和CNN（利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应），通过对数线性池化进行融合，采用拉普拉斯近似进行贝叶斯推断。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验表明，随着训练点增加，定位精度提高且不确定性降低，不确定性主要集中在干扰源附近和城市峡谷等传播敏感区域。

Conclusion: 该混合框架能够有效提高GNSS干扰源定位精度并重建接收信号强度场，同时提供后验不确定性估计，特别适用于城市环境中的干扰定位问题。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

TL;DR: MEIcoder是一种生物启发的解码方法，利用神经元特异性最兴奋输入(MEIs)、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，在从V1皮层单细胞活动重建视觉刺激方面达到最先进性能，特别擅长处理小数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵长类或人类等生物数据稀缺，高通量记录技术难以应用，这对深度学习解码技术构成挑战。

Method: 使用神经元特异性最兴奋输入(MEIs)、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，构建生物启发的解码方法。

Result: 在仅有1,000-2,500个神经元和少于1,000个训练数据点的情况下，能够重建高保真自然图像，在小数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 证明了在早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Conclusion: 生成核心、交互循环和记忆系统是构建世界模型的关键要素，这条发展路径是实现真正世界模型的最有希望的方向。

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

Motivation: 旨在通过数据驱动方法改进约翰霍普金斯跌倒风险评估工具（JHFRAT），使其与更多临床有意义指标对齐，提升住院患者跌倒风险预测的准确性。

Method: 对54,209例住院患者进行回顾性分析，使用约束评分优化（CSO）模型结合JHFRAT评估数据和电子健康记录变量，并与当前JHFRAT和XGBoost基准模型进行比较。

Result: 约束评分优化模型显著优于当前JHFRAT（CSO AUC-ROC=0.91 vs JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86），与XGBoost模型（AUC-ROC=0.94）相比在风险标签变化时表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 这种基于证据的方法为医疗系统提供了坚实基础，可通过数据驱动优化技术系统性地改进住院患者跌倒预防方案，改善风险评估和资源分配。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对Thompson采样在强化学习中性能的理解，强调了结构假设和模型不确定性在有限时域马尔可夫决策过程中的作用。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Conclusion: 提出的DP驱动多模态学习框架能够自动实现突出的模态内表征学习和跨模态对齐之间的最优平衡，为多模态融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解象棋规则，而不仅仅是学习训练数据中的模式，通过测试模型在分布外场景中的表现来评估其系统泛化能力。

Method: 训练了一个2.7亿参数的象棋Transformer模型，并在精心设计的分布外场景中进行测试，包括规则外推测试和Chess960变体，同时分析训练动态。

Result: 模型展现出组合泛化能力，在规则外推测试中表现良好，能选择有效移动；在Chess960中虽能进行基本策略适应，但不如符号AI算法；训练动态显示模型先学会移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习象棋的基本组合结构，在规则一致性方面表现良好，但在需要深度搜索的复杂变体中仍有改进空间，训练过程揭示了模型对游戏规则的渐进式理解。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

Motivation: 随着图生成技术的快速发展，后门漏洞成为新的安全威胁。现有研究主要关注图像扩散和无条件图生成的后门攻击，而文本引导的图生成领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器污染训练数据，在潜在扩散模型中植入后门。当推理时出现触发器时，模型会生成攻击者指定的子图，而对干净输入保持正常性能。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，攻击效果显著且隐蔽：低于10%的中毒率即可达到50%攻击成功率，24%中毒率可实现超过80%成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型存在安全漏洞，在药物发现等应用中存在严重风险，需要开发针对此类扩散模型后门攻击的鲁棒防御方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了传统观点，证明在强化学习中，反向/正向KL散度的选择并不决定模式覆盖，而是定义了最优目标分布族。模式覆盖主要取决于正则化强度、奖励和参考概率的相对尺度等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为优化反向KL会导致"模式寻找"，而正向KL会导致"质量覆盖"，后者在需要从多个不同模式采样时更受青睐。但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习中并不适用。

Method: 通过数学分析和实证研究，作者构建了一个简单、可扩展且理论合理的算法，该算法对奖励幅度进行最小修改，但优化了在所有高质量采样模式上具有高概率的目标分布。

Result: 实验表明，这种简单修改在大型语言模型和化学语言模型的后训练中都有效，提高了解决方案的质量和多样性，无需外部多样性信号，且在使用正向和反向KL时都能工作。

Conclusion: 反向/正向KL的选择决定了最优目标分布族，而模式覆盖主要取决于其他因素。作者的方法在提升多样性和质量方面有效，打破了传统直觉的限制。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

*Floris Gisolf,Zeno J. M. H. Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于大规模复杂图像集合的交互式可视化分析方法，通过构建超图来捕捉图像间的复杂重叠关系，帮助领域专家从数万张图像中高效获取洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类和分类方法无法充分表示图像间的复杂重叠关系，特别是在缺乏标注数据或预训练模型的情况下。超图能有效捕捉这些关系，但需要可视化来帮助领域专家理解。

Method: 开发了可扩展的超图构建流水线，直接从原始图像数据构建超图；集成了空间超图表示、交互式网格和矩阵可视化的交互式可视化技术；基于真实图像集合评估提供了领域专家使用指南。

Result: 可视化分析方法支持迭代探索，使领域专家能够从包含数万张图像的集合中高效获取洞察。

Conclusion: 所提出的视觉分析方法能够有效处理大规模复杂图像集合中的复杂关系，为领域专家提供强大的探索和分析工具。

Abstract: Analyzing large complex image collections in domains like forensics, accident
investigation, or social media analysis involves interpreting intricate,
overlapping relationships among images. Traditional clustering and
classification methods fail to adequately represent these complex
relationships, particularly when labeled data or suitable pre-trained models
are unavailable. Hypergraphs effectively capture overlapping relationships, but
to translate their complexity into information and insights for domain expert
users visualization is essential. We propose an interactive visual analytics
approach specifically designed for the construction, exploration, and analysis
of hypergraphs on large-scale complex image collections. Our core contributions
include: (1) a scalable pipeline for constructing hypergraphs directly from raw
image data, including a similarity measure to evaluate constructed hypergraphs
against a ground truth, (2) interactive visualization techniques that integrate
spatial hypergraph representations, interactive grids, and matrix
visualizations, enabling users to dynamically explore and interpret
relationships without becoming overwhelmed and disoriented, and (3) practical
insights on how domain experts can effectively use the application, based on
evaluation with real-life image collections. Our results demonstrate that our
visual analytics approach facilitates iterative exploration, enabling domain
experts to efficiently derive insights from image collections containing tens
of thousands of images.

### [189] [A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles and the MaxCut Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19835)
*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种量子启发的算法，使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)和密度矩阵重整化群(DMRG)方法求解QUBO问题，在数独和MaxCut问题上成功找到了全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二元优化(QUBO)问题，这些问题在数学上等价于寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态。需要一种能够可靠找到全局最小值而不仅仅是近似解的算法。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加态，结合离散驱动调度将MPS引导至基态。在每个步骤中，驱动哈密顿量（包含横向磁场）与问题哈密顿量结合，实现自旋翻转和量子隧穿。使用DMRG方法通过多次扫描自旋链来迭代最小化系统能量。

Result: 在包含超过200个伊辛自旋的中间难度数独谜题上验证了有效性，成功解决了Biq Mac库中最多251个节点和3,265条边的MaxCut问题实例。算法可靠地识别了全局最小值，而不仅仅是近似最优解。

Conclusion: 这种量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业规模QUBO应用的优势。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

### [190] [Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19836)
*Eliseo Curcio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了分析可靠性基准(ARB)，这是首个用于量化大型语言模型在能源系统分析中推理可靠性的标准化框架，包含五个子指标，并在四种前沿模型上进行了测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在能源领域的应用缺乏标准化框架来评估系统推理的正确性，现有验证方法主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，而忽略了分析结论的逻辑完整性。

Method: 开发了ARB框架，整合准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性纪律、政策一致性和透明度五个子指标，使用公开技术经济数据集(NREL ATB 2024等)，在四种前沿模型(GPT-4/5、Claude 4.5 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Llama 3 70B)上进行确定性、概率性和认知性场景评估。

Result: 推理可靠性可以被客观测量：GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet实现了政策合规的推理(分析可靠性指数>90)，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等稳定，Llama 3 70B低于专业阈值。统计验证显示这些差异显著且可重现。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统中因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信赖和透明的分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

TL;DR: Branch-and-Browse是一个细粒度的网页代理框架，通过树状结构探索、网页状态重放和页面动作记忆，显著提升了LLM驱动的自主网页代理在多步推理任务中的成功率和执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自主网页代理方法在多步推理深度和执行效率方面存在局限：线性方法无法处理多步推理且缺乏有效回溯，其他搜索策略则粒度粗糙且计算成本高。

Method: 采用显式子任务管理的树状结构探索实现可控多分支推理，通过网页状态重放进行高效探索，并利用页面动作记忆在会话内外共享已探索的动作。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，任务成功率达到35.8%，执行时间相比最先进方法减少高达40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的LLM网页代理框架，在开放网页环境中实现了实用的具身推理。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

TL;DR: 提出DAG-MATH框架，将思维链建模为基于规则的有向无环图随机过程，引入逻辑紧密度指标评估LLM的推理一致性，发现即使PASS@k指标相似时不同模型家族在推理保真度上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前不清楚LLM在数学问题上的成功是源于搜索、机械记忆还是规则一致推理的问题，提供超越传统PASS@k指标的评估方法。

Method: 将思维链建模为基于规则的有向无环图随机过程，节点表示中间推导状态，边编码规则应用，引入逻辑紧密度指标，构建DAG-MATH CoT格式基准。

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集上发现代表性LLM家族在推理保真度上存在统计显著差异，即使PASS@k指标相当，揭示了最终答案准确性与规则一致推导之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式思维链和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLM推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

TL;DR: Surfer 2是一个基于纯视觉观察的统一架构，在网页、桌面和移动环境中实现最先进的性能，无需任务特定微调即可超越所有现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统依赖环境特定接口，限制了跨平台部署，需要构建能够跨网页、桌面和移动环境泛化的通用代理。

Method: 集成层次化上下文管理、解耦的规划与执行，以及带自适应恢复的自验证机制，支持长任务周期的可靠操作。

Result: 在WebVoyager上达到97.1%准确率，WebArena 69.6%，OSWorld 60.1%，AndroidWorld 87.1%，多尝试下在所有基准测试中超越人类表现。

Conclusion: 系统化编排放大了基础模型能力，实现了仅通过视觉交互的通用计算机控制，但需要下一代视觉语言模型来实现帕累托最优的成本效率。

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long
task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on
WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal
cost-efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE是一个模式无关的图神经网络特征编码器，使用共享的模态特定编码器和交叉注意力模块，在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络需要为每种节点类型和特征列设计特定的特征编码器，这限制了可扩展性和参数共享，无法适应不同的数据模式。

Method: 使用共享的模态特定编码器处理分类、数值、文本和时间属性，然后通过Perceiver风格的交叉注意力模块将特征聚合为固定大小的节点表示。

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，RELATE在ReLGNN和HGT上的性能与模式特定编码器相差不到3%，同时参数数量减少了5倍。

Conclusion: RELATE支持不同的数据模式，使通用图神经网络能够进行多数据集预训练，为关系图数据的基础模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

Method: 保险公司部署AI深度伪造检测软件和增强验证流程来检测和缓解AI驱动的欺诈。本文提出了UVeye分层解决方案，代表在检测、缓解和威慑这种新型欺诈能力方面的重大进步。

Result: 当前的缓解策略面临显著限制，检测工具可能出现误报和漏报，复杂的欺诈者不断调整策略以规避自动检查。生成式AI与检测技术之间的猫鼠游戏仍在继续。

Conclusion: 由于资源和经济障碍，打击AI驱动的保险欺诈仍然是一个持续挑战。UVeye的分层解决方案代表了应对这一新欺诈浪潮能力的重要进步。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

Motivation: 展示文本与作者意图的彻底分离，进一步削弱对书面通信的信任，揭示AI安全面临的紧迫问题。

Method: 提出简单高效的协议，使用8B参数的开源LLM在笔记本电脑上几秒内完成编码和解码。

Result: 即使是中等规模的LLM也能获得高质量结果，可以隐藏与摘要等长的信息。

Conclusion: 这种协议的存在挑战了我们对LLM知识理解的基础，为AI安全提出了紧迫问题。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Conclusion: 需要建立新的AI使用范式，强调对真相的忠诚和公民责任等价值观，这些应该成为法律实践的基础。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

### [201] [TRUST: A Decentralized Framework for Auditing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20188)
*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRUST是一个去中心化的AI审计框架，通过共识机制、层次化DAG分解、区块链账本和隐私保护分段，解决大语言模型推理链的忠实性和无害性验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审计方法集中化、不透明且难以扩展，无法有效验证大语言模型复杂推理链的忠实性和无害性，存在鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明度和隐私四大挑战。

Method: 采用共识机制确保在30%恶意参与者下的正确性；使用层次化DAG分解实现可扩展并行审计；通过区块链账本记录验证决策保证公开问责；利用隐私保护分段仅共享部分推理步骤保护专有逻辑。

Result: 在多个LLM（GPT-OSS、DeepSeek-r1、Qwen）和推理任务（数学、医学、科学、人文）上的实验表明，TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，并对抗性审计者保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRUST框架为去中心化AI审计开创了先河，为大语言模型的安全可信部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

### [202] [The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出AGI发展需要经历一个锁定阶段，即从开放模仿转向身份整合，使目标结构、拒绝行为、偏好和内部表征变得稳定且抵抗外部引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类发展类比，假设AGI进步需要身份整合阶段，以实现可靠性和安全性。

Method: 形式化这一阶段，将其与学习动态现象关联，提出操作性指标进行检测，并通过实验验证行为整合的动态特性。

Result: 实验显示行为整合快速且非线性，但对通用能力的影响各异：小模型出现性能权衡，中等规模模型基本无成本，大型量化模型出现瞬时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份整合是AGI级可靠性的前提，也是安全性的关键控制点，可被工程化设计用于可靠性，但也可能在扩展过程中自发形成，硬化不可预测的目标和行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在动态环境中优化AI的进化训练方法，使用2048游戏作为测试平台。比较了单智能体系统（基于价值函数优化的蒙特卡洛树搜索）和双智能体元提示系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的性能是机器学习研究的基本挑战。2048游戏结合了策略性游戏玩法和随机元素，是研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应的理想平台。

Method: 实现两种系统：1）双智能体元提示系统，其中"思考者"LLM智能体为"执行者"LLM智能体优化游戏策略；2）单智能体系统，基于优化有限蒙特卡洛树搜索的价值函数，并实验回滚功能以避免性能退化。

Result: 单智能体系统取得显著改进，每个周期平均增加473.2分，训练周期间呈现明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解也增强，开发出越来越先进的策略。相反，双智能体系统改进有限，突显了元提示的内在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了进化优化技术在非确定性环境中提高AI性能的潜力，单智能体方法比元提示方法更有效。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

*Tianyi Zhang,Xiaolin Zhou,Yunzhe Wang,Erik Cambria,David Traum,Rui Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了个性化认知模拟(ICS)任务，评估不同认知表征方法在模拟个体思维过程方面的效果，通过小说数据集和11条件认知评估框架测试了7个现成LLM在作者风格模仿中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM能够模仿表面的人类行为（如角色扮演），但其模拟更深层次个性化认知过程的能力仍不清楚，需要系统评估LLM在认知模拟方面的潜力。

Method: 构建了基于近期出版小说（晚于测试LLM发布日期）的数据集，提出了11条件认知评估框架，测试了包括语言特征、概念映射和基于档案信息在内的不同认知表征方法。

Result: 结果显示概念和语言特征的组合在ICS中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索。LLM在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，突显了其在更深层次认知模拟方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推动了更个性化和人类对齐的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型通过上下文学习生成抽象的PDDL领域和问题实例，以自然语言指定的抽象目标为基础，验证了GPT-4o在简单场景下能有效合成规划领域抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态领域抽象的选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力，但目前生成与特定目标对齐的抽象仍是一个挑战。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，利用大型语言模型的上下文学习能力，根据自然语言指定的抽象目标生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例。

Result: 实验表明GPT-4o在简单设置下通常能合成有用的规划领域抽象，但在抽象动作方面比抽象相关状态变量表现更好。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可以用于生成规划领域抽象，但仍有改进空间，特别是在状态变量抽象方面。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

TL;DR: 提出了STaBERT模型，通过整合POI信息和时间描述符来增强人类移动性预测的语义理解，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用兴趣点(POI)提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 在BERT-based移动性模型基础上，引入推导的时间描述符和POI嵌入，构建统一、语义丰富的移动性表示。

Result: 单城市预测的GEO-BLEU分数从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: STaBERT通过整合POI和时间信息，显著改善了人类移动性预测的准确性。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

TL;DR: ToolEQA是一个集成外部工具和多步推理的EQA智能体，通过工具获取有用信息来指导探索方向，在减少探索距离的同时提高回答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EQA方法直接使用视觉语言模型探索环境而不进行显式思考或规划，限制了推理能力，导致探索效率低下和回答效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolEQA代理，集成外部工具进行多步推理；设计自动生成EQA任务的数据管道，构建包含18K任务的EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen测试集上，ToolEQA比最先进基线方法成功率提高9.2~20.2%，比零样本ToolEQA提高10%；在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上也达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过工具集成和多步推理显著提升了EQA任务的性能，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

TL;DR: 该论文基于AI4HealthyAging项目经验，分析了临床数据收集中存在的多种偏见类型，并提出了改善医疗AI系统公平性和鲁棒性的实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗领域前景广阔，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，AI解决方案在临床实践中的整合仍然有限。主要障碍是数据收集过程中的偏见问题。

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划中的AI4HealthyAging项目，通过检测临床数据收集过程中的偏见，识别了多种偏见类型。

Result: 识别了跨多个用例的多种偏见类型，包括历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见，这些偏见体现在性别、年龄、居住环境、社会经济地位、设备和标签等变量中。

Conclusion: 提出了改善临床问题设计和数据收集公平性和鲁棒性的实用建议，希望为开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Motivation: 在AI系统在战场中作用日益重要的时代，确保负责任的打击需要严格评估潜在的附带效应，因此需要开发可靠的附带损害评估模型。

Method: 采用设计科学方法论，构建统一的知识表示与推理架构，整合时间、空间和力量维度，考虑传播、严重性、可能性和评估指标，通过透明推理机制提供清晰表示。

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中AI系统打击的附带损害提供了有效框架，支持构建更负责任和可信赖的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的出现，知识图谱构建正从基于规则和统计的流程转向语言驱动和生成框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变。

Method: 从两个互补视角回顾新兴的LLM驱动方法：强调结构、规范化和一致性的基于模式范式，以及强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现的免模式范式。

Result: 系统分析了各阶段的代表性框架、技术机制及其局限性，为理解LLM与知识图谱的演进关系提供了清晰框架。

Conclusion: 该调查旨在阐明LLM与知识图谱之间不断发展的相互作用，弥合符号知识工程与神经语义理解之间的差距，推动自适应、可解释和智能知识系统的发展。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决指令调优模型在持续预训练时指令跟随能力和语义表示退化的问题，同时不依赖原始基础模型或外部领域知识库。

Method: IKnow框架，使用指令-响应对话格式设计自监督目标，从文本本身提取领域知识并学习深层语义编码。

Result: 无需外部资源即可实现持续预训练，保持模型的指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一种简单通用的持续预训练方法，不依赖外部资源，有效保持模型性能。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经符号概念学习方法大多依赖描述逻辑推理器，但这些推理器对知识库中的不一致和错误数据不够鲁棒，限制了在实际知识库中的应用。

Method: EBR推理器基于嵌入技术，仅需要检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能检索或近似任何SHOIQ描述逻辑概念的实例集合。

Result: 实验表明，与最先进的推理器相比，EBR对缺失和错误数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EBR通过神经推理方法有效解决了传统符号推理器在现实世界知识库中应用的局限性，为概念学习提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注实体级对齐，缺乏可解释性推理且需要训练数据。FLORA旨在解决这些问题，提供无需训练数据的全栈对齐方案。

Method: 基于模糊逻辑的迭代方法，同时对齐实体和关系，支持悬空实体检测，并具有可证明的收敛性。

Result: 在主要基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单有效的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，具有可解释性、收敛性和处理悬空实体的能力。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究旨在探讨政府在AI治理中如何收集和回应公众意见，以及这种参与过程是否能够建立公众对AI及其治理的信任。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，比较三个国家（澳大利亚、哥伦比亚、美国）征集AI风险和政策的公众反馈方式，以及这些反馈是否影响了治理决策。

Result: 研究发现三国均未能建立有意义的对话机制，参与率低于1%，政府缺乏多样性声音的吸引和反馈的积极响应，导致参与式治理效果不佳。

Conclusion: 当前参与式AI治理方法难以建立信任和合法性，作者提出八项改进建议，包括提升AI素养、扩大参与范围、采用创新参与方法等。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种图神经网络加速的网络拓扑优化方法，用于解决电网拥堵管理问题，实现了大规模系统近实时优化，并在泛化性和跨系统迁移方面取得显著进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有求解器无法在近实时内解决大规模电网的混合整数非线性拓扑优化问题，而传统机器学习方法在未见拓扑、变化运行条件和不同系统间的泛化能力有限，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用图神经网络(GNN)方法，开发了异构边感知消息传递神经网络来预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选拓扑优化解，该方法能够捕捉局部潮流模式并实现拓扑泛化。

Result: 在GOC 2000总线系统上实现了4个数量级的加速，在1分钟内提供交流可行的解决方案，最优性差距仅为2.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现大规模系统近实时网络拓扑优化迈出了重要一步，在拓扑和跨系统泛化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

### [217] [What Defines Good Reasoning in LLMs? Dissecting Reasoning Steps with Multi-Aspect Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20603)
*Heejin Do,Jaehui Hwang,Dongyoon Han,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出因果逐步评估方法(CaSE)来细粒度评估LLM推理质量，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，并通过基于CaSE评估的数据筛选提升最终任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仅评估LLM最终答案正确性的方法过于粗糙，忽视了推理过程的质量，无法为模型改进提供有效信号。需要更细粒度的推理评估方法来构建更鲁棒的模型。

Method: 提出CaSE方法，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性：相关性衡量步骤是否基于问题，连贯性衡量步骤是否从先前步骤逻辑推导。CaSE仅使用前文上下文评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在专家标注的MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准上验证了CaSE与人工评估的一致性。更重要的是，使用CaSE评估的相关性和连贯性来筛选训练数据能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE为分析、调试和改进LLM推理提供了可扩展框架，证明了超越有效性检查的实际价值，细粒度推理评估是提升模型性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

TL;DR: 提出了两种近线性时间算法来计算大规模网络中的随机游走中心性，解决了现有方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走中心性能够捕捉丰富的图结构信息，但在大规模网络上计算现有方法计算成本过高，难以实用。

Method: 提出了两种算法：一种基于近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计，另一种基于采样根生成树，两种算法都提供强近似保证。

Result: 在包括超过1000万个节点的大规模真实网络上的广泛实验证明了所提算法的效率和近似质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够高效计算大规模网络的随机游走中心性，解决了现有方法的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

TL;DR: MIMOSA框架是一个可解释性设计的方法论，旨在生成平衡可解释性与性能的预测模型，同时嵌入因果性、公平性和隐私性等关键伦理属性。


<details>

Motivation: 需要开发可信赖的AI系统，在真实应用中促进信任、问责和安全采用自动化决策模型。

Method: 形式化定义了监督学习设置，涵盖表格数据、时间序列、图像、文本等多种数据类型。分析了特征重要性、规则和实例三类可解释模型家族，并形式化了因果性、公平性和隐私性三个伦理属性。

Result: 建立了开发不仅准确可解释，而且公平、保护隐私和具有因果意识的AI系统的理论基础。

Conclusion: MIMOSA框架为开发可信赖的AI系统提供了理论基础，通过在模型生成过程中评估伦理度量，确保模型具备可解释性、公平性、隐私保护和因果意识。

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

TL;DR: EcomEval是一个全面的多语言多模态基准测试，用于评估LLM在电子商务领域的表现，覆盖6个类别37个任务，包含8个多模态任务，支持7种语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务评估基准存在任务多样性不足、模态有限、数据合成化、语言覆盖窄等问题，无法可靠评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中的表现。

Method: 采用半自动流程：大模型生成候选回答，50多名电商和多语言专家审核修改；基于不同规模模型评分定义问题难度等级；主要使用真实客户查询和交易日志数据。

Result: 构建了反映真实业务交互噪声和异构性的综合基准，支持多语言（包括5种东南亚低资源语言）和多模态评估。

Conclusion: EcomEval填补了电子商务领域评估基准的空白，为从业者提供了评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中表现的可靠工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要量化模型在动态扩展环境中的适应能力，特别是在上下文切换和连续性方面的表现，以评估真正超级智能模型的适应性要求。

Method: 建立基于初始、当前和未来环境状态偏差的评估基准，区分封闭式和开放式基准，优先使用闭环开放式真实世界基准来测试适应性。

Result: 提出了流动性指数作为量化模型适应性的方法，能够评估模型理解、预测和适应状态变化的能力。

Conclusion: 真正超级智能的模型应至少具备二阶适应性，能够通过数字补充实现自我维持计算，以达到最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

Motivation: 由于机器学习模型在感知和认知任务中展现出类人能力，将ML集成到理性智能体架构的框架日益受到关注，但现有研究零散且不连贯，往往忽视理性架构的表达能力。

Method: 使用BDI（信念-欲望-意图）范式作为参考框架，对现有方法进行细粒度系统化分析。

Conclusion: 本文为设计有效的理性ML智能体提供了系统化分析和开放挑战识别，强调了BDI范式在集成ML方面的潜力。

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于拓扑数据分析(TDA)的框架来评估大语言模型推理轨迹的质量，相比传统图结构指标能更好地捕捉推理的几何特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家标注、人工评估，自动化方法主要使用图结构指标，但这些指标过于简化复杂推理过程，无法准确反映推理质量。

Method: 采用拓扑数据分析(TDA)框架，通过捕捉推理轨迹的几何特征来评估推理质量，实现标签高效、自动化的评估。

Result: 拓扑特征在预测推理质量方面比标准图指标具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理更适合用高维几何结构而非纯关系图来捕捉。

Conclusion: 紧凑稳定的拓扑特征集能可靠指示轨迹质量，为未来强化学习算法提供了实用的信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调的KGQA框架，通过'计划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考'范式，让LLM在不完整知识条件下自主规划并自适应检索KG和网络资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用KG的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，在复杂场景下存在KG覆盖不完整、缺乏外部信息判断机制、推理短视等问题。

Method: 采用两阶段强化微调：1) 链式思维微调方法解决GRPO冷启动问题；2) 计划检索引导的强化学习过程，集成显式规划和检索动作，结合笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题。

Result: 该方法通过多奖励设计优化推理检索过程，使模型能够学习何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT框架能够在不完整知识条件下实现自主规划和自适应检索调度，提升复杂KGQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于广义均值积分的AGI一致性度量方法，替代了传统算术平均值的补偿性假设，能够惩罚能力不平衡并捕捉领域间依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义使用算术平均值，假设领域间能力可以相互补偿，但真正的通用智能应该反映跨所有基本领域的一致充分性。

Method: 基于广义均值在补偿性指数连续统上的积分，形成曲线下面积(AUC)度量，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值三种补偿性假设。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分，一致性调整的AUC显示尽管算术得分较高(如GPT-5为24%)，但两个系统距离通用能力仍很远。

Conclusion: 广义均值积分提供了原则性、可解释且更严格的AGI进展度量基础，能够更好地评估真正的通用智能进展。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.
