*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TinyViT-Batten框架，使用小参数Vision Transformer通过少样本学习检测早期Batten病，在79例患者和90例对照的MRI数据上达到约91%准确率和0.95以上AUC，优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病是一种罕见儿科神经退行性疾病，早期MRI征象细微且常被漏诊，需要开发能够在有限训练样本下准确检测的AI方法。

Method: 将大型教师ViT蒸馏为5M参数的TinyViT，使用基于度量的少样本学习（原型损失，5-shot episodes）进行微调，并集成Grad-CAM提供可解释性。

Result: 在多中心数据集上达到高准确率（约91%）和AUC（≥0.95），敏感性>90%，特异性约90%，优于3D-ResNet和Swin-Tiny基线模型。

Conclusion: 模型的小尺寸和强性能展示了用于早期Batten病检测的实用AI解决方案，Grad-CAM可突出疾病相关脑区实现可解释预测。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析领域面临数据量有限和数据可信度的挑战，现有方法在数据充足时表现良好但难以应对数据稀缺场景。

Method: TreeNet通过整合神经网络、集成学习和树基决策模型的关键特征，构建分层决策集成学习框架，提升模型的适应性和可解释性。

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT)，通过B样条编码和多阶段残差量化技术，将高维连续动作序列压缩为紧凑的离散表示，实现6.8倍的序列长度缩减，同时保持重建质量，加速自回归模型的训练收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归VLA模型在处理长动作序列时面临效率问题，传统压缩方法存在重建质量差或压缩效率低的问题，需要一种既能高效压缩又能保持动作重建质量的tokenization方法。

Method: 使用B样条编码进行值范围和时间跨度的归一化，然后对位置、旋转和夹爪子空间应用多阶段残差量化，生成具有粗细粒度的压缩离散token，并结合跨具身学习策略利用异构示教数据。

Result: 在Droid大规模数据集上预训练后，离散tokenization将训练序列缩短6.8倍，降低目标熵，在真实机器人和仿真实验中展现出更高的压缩效率和更好的模型性能。

Conclusion: OmniSAT在保持重建质量的同时实现了高效的动作序列压缩，显著加速了自回归模型的训练收敛，并通过跨具身学习策略扩展了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [5] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的知识感知Mamba（KAMamba）方法用于增强MODIS变化检测，通过知识驱动的转换矩阵、多任务学习和时空谱Mamba模块来解决MODIS数据中的混合像素、信息耦合和背景异质性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS时间序列变化检测对于环境监测至关重要，但由于混合像素、空间-光谱-时间信息耦合效应以及背景类别异质性等关键MODIS困难，这是一项极具挑战性的任务。

Method: 设计了知识驱动的转换矩阵引导方法（KAT-loss）、多任务学习方法（PreC-loss、PostC-loss、Chg-loss）、空间-光谱-时间Mamba模块（SSTMamba）以及稀疏可变形Mamba骨干网络（SDMamba）。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的MODIS时间序列数据集上评估，变化检测的平均F1得分比基线提高了约1.5-6%，LULC分类的OA、AA和Kappa指标提高了约2%。

Conclusion: KAMamba方法通过知识引导和多任务学习有效解决了MODIS变化检测中的关键挑战，在变化检测和土地覆盖分类任务上都取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [6] [A Framework for Low-Effort Training Data Generation for Urban Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11567)
*Denis Zavadski,Damjan Kalšan,Tim Küchler,Haebom Lee,Stefan Roth,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，使用扩散模型将合成数据集适配到特定目标域，仅需不完美的伪标签，就能生成高保真、目标对齐的图像，显著提升语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据集与真实图像存在明显差距，特别是在特定目标域（如Cityscapes）中，这种差距限制了模型性能。传统方法需要昂贵的3D建模，违背了低成本标注数据的初衷。

Method: 使用现成的扩散模型，仅通过不完美的伪标签进行目标域适配训练。该方法过滤次优生成结果，修正图像-标签不对齐问题，并统一不同数据集的语义标注。

Result: 在五个合成数据集和两个真实目标数据集上的实验显示，语义分割性能比最先进的翻译方法提升了高达+8.0% mIoU，使快速构建的合成数据集达到与耗时数月构建的高质量合成数据集相当的效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了一种有价值的协作范式：快速语义原型设计与生成模型相结合，能够为城市场景理解创建可扩展的高质量训练数据。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

### [7] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NNDM混合框架，结合NN-UNet和扩散模型，通过迭代去噪过程提升脑肿瘤分割精度，在BraTS 2021数据集上表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型如U-Net在脑肿瘤MRI分割中存在泛化能力不足、边界精度差和数据多样性有限的问题。

Method: 将NN-UNet的稳健特征提取与扩散概率模型的生成能力相结合，扩散模型学习预测与真实分割掩码之间的残差分布，通过迭代去噪过程修正结构不一致性。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，NNDM在Dice系数和Hausdorff距离指标上优于传统U-Net和基于transformer的基线方法，增强了跨模态和肿瘤子区域的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NNDM为确定性分割网络与随机扩散模型的结合开辟了新方向，推进了自动化脑肿瘤分析的技术水平。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的微表情识别方法，通过两种互补的动态图像表示和自适应融合网络，在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情具有极低强度且难以察觉，但在测谎、行为分析和心理评估中具有重要价值。现有方法在捕捉微表情的时序动态和细微运动方面存在不足。

Method: 提出两种互补表示：时间排序动态图像（强调时序进展）和运动强度动态图像（通过帧重排序机制突出细微运动）。设计自适应融合网络自动学习最优整合这两种表示。

Result: 在CASME-II数据集上达到93.95%准确率和0.897 UF1，创下新纪录；在SAMM数据集上达到82.47%准确率和0.665 UF1；在MMEW数据集上达到76.00%准确率。

Conclusion: 所提出的输入表示和网络架构在提升微表情识别性能中发挥重要作用，为情感计算、测谎和人机交互等领域的研究和应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文是第一篇全面综述多视角多摄像头系统的调查，将MVMC跟踪、重识别和动作理解统一到一个框架中，提出了独特的分类法，并讨论了该领域的开放研究问题和未来方向。


<details>

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

### [10] [Constructive Distortion: Improving MLLMs with Attention-Guided Image Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09741)
*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过多模态大语言模型的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，重新分配空间分辨率到模型认为重要的区域，从而提升细粒度感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂场景中经常忽略小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知定位错误。

Method: 使用MLLM的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，在不改变模型权重或架构的情况下重新分配空间分辨率到相关区域。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLM模型上，AttWarp持续提高准确性，增强组合推理能力，减少幻觉，优于四个竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲能够优先处理与查询相关的信息同时保留上下文，相同的MLLM在接收这种扭曲输入时表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

Motivation: 探索在多模态语境（图像-句子配对）中外语学习者如何推断陌生词汇意义，以及哪些因素影响学习效果。

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同的图像-文本配对，分析数据特征（图像和文本）与参与者推断陌生词汇能力的关系，以及参与者语言背景与成功率的关联。

Result: 发现只有部分直观特征与参与者表现有强相关性，需要进一步研究预测性特征；同时发现AI系统在预测参与者表现方面具有改进潜力。

Conclusion: 需要深入研究影响多模态外语学习任务成功的预测性特征，并为提升AI系统在此类任务中的推理能力指明了有前景的未来方向。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

*Weiqing Luo,Zhen Tan,Yifan Li,Xinyu Zhao,Kwonjoon Lee,Behzad Dariush,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法来解决视觉大语言模型在固定分辨率下性能不佳的问题，通过分析不同视觉语言任务的分辨率偏好，并开发参数高效的微调技术来扩展视觉输入分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型假设固定分辨率用于下游任务，导致性能不佳。现实世界视觉语言应用需要不同层次的感知粒度。

Method: 首先全面调查不同视觉语言任务的分辨率偏好，发现分辨率偏好与图像复杂度和VLLM在不同输入分辨率下的不确定性方差相关。基于此提出经验公式确定最佳分辨率，然后开发参数高效的微调技术扩展预训练VLLM的视觉输入分辨率。

Result: 在各种视觉语言任务上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决VLLM在固定分辨率下的性能问题，通过自适应分辨率选择和改进的微调技术提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

Result: 研究发现某些CRF模型在图像分割中表现更好，通过比较不同方法揭示了各种CRF的优缺点和潜力。

Conclusion: 通过系统比较不同CRF模型，找到了适合提升卫星图像分割清晰度的最佳条件随机场方法。

Abstract: The output of image the segmentation process is usually not very clear due to
low quality features of Satellite images. The purpose of this study is to find
a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a
segmented image. We started with different types of CRFs and studied them as to
why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on
two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs
to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on
these datasets to show the pitfalls and potentials of different approaches.

*David Benavente-Rios,Juan Ruiz Rodriguez,Gustavo Gatica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用合成人脸数据增强单形态攻击检测，通过增量测试协议评估泛化能力，发现适度添加合成图像可提升性能，但仅依赖合成数据会导致最差效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题导致真实人脸图像数据集规模有限的问题，探索合成数据在单形态攻击检测中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用多种形态生成工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议来评估随着合成图像增加时的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过精心控制合成图像数量或逐步添加真实图像可以改善泛化能力，但过度使用合成数据会导致性能下降，仅使用合成数据时获得最高的等错误率。

Conclusion: 在操作场景中，最佳策略不是仅依赖合成数据进行单形态攻击检测，而是需要合理结合真实和合成数据。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

*Peixian Liang,Yifan Ding,Yizhe Zhang,Jianxu Chen,Hao Zheng,Hongxiao Wang,Yejia Zhang,Guangyu Meng,Tim Weninger,Michael Niemier,X. Sharon Hu,Danny Z Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ceb的新型细胞实例分割方法，通过利用细胞边界特征和标签来将前景像素划分为细胞实例，相比现有像素聚类方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的细胞实例分割方法使用像素级目标（如距离图、热扩散图等）可能会丢失细胞实例的重要几何特性（如形状、曲率、凸性），这些特性需要像素集合来表示。

Method: Ceb首先从语义分割概率图中提取潜在的细胞边界，为每个边界候选构建边界特征表示（边界签名），使用边界分类器预测其边界标签，最后基于预测的边界标签通过分割或合并相邻区域获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法，并且与最先进的细胞实例分割方法相比具有高度竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Ceb方法通过利用细胞边界特征有效解决了像素级目标可能丢失几何特性的问题，在细胞实例分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CAPEL框架，通过聚类感知的提示集成学习解决传统提示集成方法中特征平均导致类别中心偏移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示集成方法通过平均文本特征来融合多个上下文提示，但这种方法会偏离真实的类别分布，导致次优结果。

Method: CAPEL框架将图像分类到多个类别簇中，每个簇由不同的提示表示；在分类logits空间进行集成而非特征空间；引入簇保持正则化项和自适应提示权重技术。

Result: 该方法能更好地对齐视觉特征分布，保持提示的簇特性和区分能力，提升跨数据集和任务的鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: CAPEL通过簇感知的提示集成学习，有效解决了传统提示集成方法的局限性，在保持提示多样性的同时提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多目标跟踪方法，使用自监督编码器融合深度和掩码特征，生成稳定的物体表示，作为边界框IoU和重识别特征的补充相似性线索进行匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在物体相似或被遮挡时不可靠，且计算分割掩码IoU计算成本高。

Method: 使用零样本深度估计器和可提示视觉分割模型获取深度图和物体掩码，通过自监督编码器融合深度和掩码特征生成物体表示，与边界框IoU和重识别特征结合进行匹配。

Result: 在具有非线性运动、遮挡和拥挤场景的挑战性基准测试（如SportsMOT和DanceTrack）上，该方法在大多数指标上优于TBD最新技术，在简单基准测试（如MOT17）上达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次使用自监督编码器来优化分割掩码而不计算掩码IoU，在复杂场景中表现出色，同时保持了跟踪-检测模型的计算效率优势。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

Conclusion: CHUG数据集将推动无参考HDR视频质量评估研究，提供了一个大规模、多样化且真实的UGC数据集，该数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景具有不规则布局、复杂结构和遮挡问题，需要最大化有限资源的利用率。

Method: 在估计的几何支架上记录观测统计信息，指导基函数的最优放置；提出场景自适应虚拟视点来补偿输入轨迹中的几何缺陷。

Result: 在多个大规模室内场景中，相比采用规则放置的基线方法，渲染质量和内存需求均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 场景自适应策略能够有效提升神经辐射场在室内场景重建中的性能，特别是在处理不规则布局和遮挡问题时。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新颖视角合成方法在处理日常环境变化时面临挑战，需要密集的空间和时间观测。本文旨在从稀疏、非结构化的日常捕捉中有效建模长期场景变化。

Method: 将物体建模为模板高斯，作为共享对象轨迹的结构化可重用先验。通过少样本观察对模板进行细化调整以适应时变环境。训练后可通过简单变换泛化到多个时间步。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比基线方法获得更优的重建质量，同时支持快速轻量级更新。

Conclusion: LTGS框架能够有效处理长期场景变化，显著提升了3D环境时序演化的可扩展性，适用于稀疏捕捉的日常环境建模。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个多视角姿态估计框架，结合新颖的训练和后处理技术，通过模型蒸馏提高效率，在有限标注数据下实现准确跟踪和更好的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角动物姿态估计方法在有限标注数据下难以实现准确跟踪，且不确定性估计效果不佳，需要更实用的解决方案来支持科学研究中的行为量化分析。

Method: 使用多视角transformer(MVT)同时处理所有视角信息，采用补丁掩码方案学习跨视角对应关系；对于标定设置，通过3D增强和三角化损失引入几何一致性；扩展非线性集成卡尔曼平滑器(EKS)并改进不确定性量化；设计蒸馏流程利用改进的EKS预测生成高质量伪标签。

Conclusion: 开发了一个实用的、不确定性感知的系统，能够在真实世界数据约束下实现可靠姿态估计，支持下游行为分析应用。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HeadsUp模型，这是一个单步扩散模型，用于端到端地无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，解决了现有方法在面部区域和背景之间产生边界伪影的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像超分辨率技术要么专注于通用真实世界图像，要么专注于严格对齐的面部图像。处理肖像照片时需要混合不同模型，这不可避免地会在面部区域周围引入混合或边界伪影，而人类感知对面部保真度特别敏感。

Method: 在单步扩散模型基础上构建，开发了面部监督机制来引导模型关注面部区域，并集成基于参考的机制来帮助身份恢复，减少低质量面部恢复中的面部模糊。还构建了高质量4K肖像图像超分辨率数据集PortraitSR-4K。

Result: 广泛实验表明，HeadsUp在肖像图像超分辨率任务上实现了最先进的性能，同时在通用图像和对齐面部数据集上保持相当或更高的性能。

Conclusion: HeadsUp能够无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，有效解决了现有混合方法引入的边界伪影问题，为肖像图像超分辨率提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的新方法，用于建模大脑衰老轨迹，通过将纵向MRI数据表示为连续函数来解决离散采样问题，在脑衰老轨迹分类任务中表现优于传统深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类大脑在整个生命周期中经历动态的结构变化，纵向MRI数据对表征典型和非典型衰老轨迹很有价值。但由于数据的离散性和不同时空采样模式，传统深度学习方法难以表示潜在的连续生物过程。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示（INR）将纵向T1加权MRI数据建模为连续函数，设计了新颖的INR架构来部分解耦空间和时间轨迹参数，并直接在INR参数空间中进行脑衰老轨迹分类。

Result: 在更现实的不规则采样实验中，基于INR的方法在脑衰老轨迹分类任务中达到81.3%的准确率，优于标准深度学习基线模型（73.7%）。

Conclusion: INR方法能够有效处理纵向神经影像数据的离散采样问题，为表征大脑衰老轨迹提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割模型在基准测试中表现良好，但在实际应用中往往依赖虚假相关性而非真实物体边界，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 将人类修正作为干预信号，通过传播修正信息到视觉相似的图像中，系统性地纠正模型的失败模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建准确、鲁棒、数据高效且适应现实领域的分割系统提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

TL;DR: 提出了J-RAS方法，通过联合训练分割模型和检索模型，利用检索的图像-掩码对增强分割性能，在多个数据集和架构上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中手动分割耗时且存在变异性，以及AI方法需要大量标注数据和泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 联合训练分割模型和检索模型，使分割模型能够利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强解剖学理解，检索模型学习分割相关特征。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，SegFormer结合J-RAS后，Dice分数从0.8708提升到0.9115，Hausdorff距离从1.8130降低到1.1489。

Conclusion: J-RAS方法有效提升了分割性能，具有良好的通用性，适用于不同架构和数据集。

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

*Fan Zuo,Donglin Zhou,Jingqin Gao,Kaan Ozbay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于AI的端到端框架，利用现有交通摄像头进行大规模高分辨率交通监测，通过YOLOv11模型提取交通密度和分类指标，采用图基视角归一化方法处理动态摄像头视角，结合领域专用大语言模型生成自动化交通模式总结。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通传感器部署成本高，现有视频分析技术难以处理大规模摄像头网络的动态视角和海量数据，需要开发成本效益高、可扩展的交通监测解决方案。

Method: 使用微调YOLOv11模型进行实时交通密度和分类提取；提出图基视角归一化方法处理非固定PTZ摄像头不一致性；集成领域专用LLM处理海量视频流数据并生成自动化总结。

Result: 在纽约拥堵收费政策实施期间验证，工作日乘用车密度下降9%，卡车流量初期减少后反弹，行人和自行车活动持续增加；基于示例的提示提高了LLM数值准确性并减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模政策相关交通监测提供了实用、基础设施就绪的解决方案，实现最小人工干预的高效监测。

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Jinshan Pan,Shihao Zhou,Jinglei Shi,Duosheng Chen,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理原理的镜头光晕数据生成方法FlareX，包含参数化模板创建、光照感知的2D合成和基于物理引擎的3D渲染三个阶段，构建了包含9500个2D模板和3000个3D渲染图像对的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有镜头光晕数据集通常通过将人工光晕模板叠加到背景图像上来合成，但模板缺乏多样性且忽略了物理原理，导致模型在真实场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：参数化模板创建、光照感知的2D合成和物理引擎3D渲染，构建混合的2D和3D光晕数据集FlareX，并设计掩码方法从损坏图像中获取真实无光晕图像。

Result: 构建了包含9500个2D模板（来自95种光晕模式）和3000个光晕图像对（来自60个3D场景）的数据集，实验证明该方法有效。

Conclusion: 提出的物理信息光晕数据生成方法和FlareX数据集能有效提升模型在真实场景中的泛化性能。

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了BurstDeflicker数据集，通过三种互补的数据采集策略解决闪烁伪影去除研究中缺乏大规模真实数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动快门相机与交流电照明的时间强度变化相互作用产生的闪烁伪影会降低图像质量并影响高级视觉任务，但缺乏大规模真实数据集阻碍了闪烁去除研究的发展。

Method: 1. 基于Retinex的合成流水线，可控地操纵关键闪烁属性；2. 从不同场景捕获4000张真实闪烁图像；3. 提出绿幕方法在动态场景中保留真实闪烁退化。

Result: 构建了可扩展的基准数据集，综合实验证明了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker数据集具有推动闪烁去除研究发展的潜力。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MIMO模型，解决现有医疗视觉语言模型的两个问题：输入仅依赖文本指令缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解，输出仅提供文本答案缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。MIMO具有视觉参考多模态输入和像素定位多模态输出能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型存在两个主要问题：输入方面只依赖文本指令而缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解；输出方面只提供文本答案而缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。

Method: 提出统一的医疗视觉语言模型MIMO，具有视觉参考多模态输入和像素定位多模态输出能力。构建了MIMOSeg数据集，包含89.5万个样本，从四个不同角度构建，涵盖基本指令跟随和复杂问答任务。

Result: 在多个下游医疗多模态任务上进行实验，广泛实验结果验证MIMO能够独特地结合视觉参考和像素定位能力，这是先前模型所不具备的。

Conclusion: MIMO模型成功解决了现有医疗视觉语言模型的局限性，能够同时理解复杂医疗图像语义并将医疗术语在图像中进行像素级定位。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

*Junan Chen,Trung Thanh Nguyen,Takahiro Komamizu,Ichiro Ide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Q-Adapter，一种轻量级视觉适配器模块，用于增强多模态大语言模型在视频字幕任务中的高效微调，在保持参数效率的同时实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全模型微调方法在大模型时代计算成本过高，而现有的参数高效微调方法主要关注语言组件，在视觉信息处理方面研究不足，特别是在多模态任务中。

Method: Q-Adapter在视觉编码器中引入可学习查询令牌和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可有效提取稀疏的、与字幕相关的特征。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，Q-Adapter在BLEU@4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr指标上均达到参数高效微调方法中的最先进性能，仅需1.4%的参数即可与全微调方法竞争。

Conclusion: Q-Adapter在字幕质量和参数效率之间实现了良好平衡，展示了其在视频语言建模中的可扩展性潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P-4DGS是一种新颖的动态3D高斯泼溅表示方法，通过空间-时间预测和自适应量化策略，显著降低了动态场景重建的存储需求，同时保持高质量重建和实时渲染性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态3D高斯泼溅算法忽视了动态场景中固有的时间和空间冗余，导致内存消耗过高，需要一种更紧凑的4D场景建模方法。

Method: 设计基于3D锚点的空间-时间预测模块，利用3D高斯基元间的时空相关性，结合自适应量化和基于上下文的熵编码来压缩3D锚点。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的重建质量和最快的渲染速度，平均存储占用仅为1MB，在合成和真实场景上分别实现了40倍和90倍的压缩。

Conclusion: P-4DGS通过有效利用时空冗余和压缩技术，为动态3D场景重建提供了一种高效且紧凑的解决方案，显著降低了存储需求同时保持了高质量的重建效果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了CCFormer框架，通过并行双边架构整合多尺度视觉特征与音频数据，使用多查询Transformer模块建模时空关系，并引入双模态对比学习来增强跨模态对齐，在多个数据集上达到新的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，而基于Transformer的方法在处理多模态系数和时序动态方面存在不足，需要更全面的时空上下文建模能力。

Method: CCFormer包含三个核心模块：早期整合模块（EIM）用于跨模态互补，多查询Transformer模块（MTM）用于时空特征提取，双模态对比学习（BCL）用于特征空间对齐。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上均达到了新的最优性能基准。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过有效整合局部和全局信息，全面捕捉时空上下文，显著提升了音频-视觉分割的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型通常依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索，而人类专家在临床实践中会迭代扫描、聚焦和细化感兴趣区域。ViTAR旨在缩小这种机器与人类感知差距。

Method: 提出ViTAR框架，采用"思考-行动-再思考-回答"的认知链；构建包含1K交互示例和16K视觉问答的高质量指令数据集；采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调引导认知轨迹，强化学习优化决策。

Result: ViTAR在广泛评估中优于现有最先进模型；视觉注意力分析显示，从"思考"到"再思考"阶段，模型逐渐锚定到临床关键区域，并在推理过程中保持对视觉标记的高注意力分配。

Conclusion: 将专家风格的迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型可以增强医学AI的性能和可信度，为改进医疗AI系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly

Conclusion: CLSL方法通过协同学习语义感知特征和标签恢复，有效解决了不完整标签下的多标签图像识别问题，形成了两个过程的相互增强循环。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art

*Pîrvu Mihai-Cristian,Leordeanu Marius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHG-MAE：一种将神经图与掩码自编码器统一的新型概率超图模型，通过随机掩码整个模态而非仅图像块，在单次训练循环中结合预训练和微调，并支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用自监督预训练方法（如MAE）无需手动标注数据的优势，将传统神经图与现代掩码自编码器统一在共同理论框架下，解决多模态多任务学习场景中的模型集成问题。

Method: 提出PHG-MAE模型，通过随机掩码整个模态（不仅是图像块）来采样超边分布，将预训练和微调结合到单一训练循环中，并创建推理时集成来提升预测性能和一致性。

Result: 模型能够创建推理时集成，通过聚合提升最终预测性能和一致性，并可在集成基础上应用知识蒸馏，即使参数少于100万的模型也能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: PHG-MAE为多模态多任务学习提供了有效的统一框架，主要应用于无人机户外场景，但可推广到自动驾驶、室内机器人等类似领域，并发布了相关数据集和工具。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

*Meijun Zhou,Gang Mei,Zhengjing Ma,Nengxiong Xu,Jianbing Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的通用框架，用于追踪大规模滑坡疤痕的时空演化，通过将离散遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，实现滑坡演化过程的连续监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单阶段或前后双阶段滑坡识别，难以追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化过程，而这对理解演化机制、识别破坏前兆和有效预警至关重要。

Method: 将离散光学遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，利用为视频分割开发的视觉基础模型，在知识引导、自动传播和交互精炼的范式下实现滑坡疤痕的连续准确识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模滑坡疤痕的时空演化追踪提供了一种有效方法，在滑坡预警和风险评估中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，能够从无位姿的稀疏图像中进行鲁棒的新视角合成和几何一致重建，通过VGGT基础模型获取初始位姿和密集点云，结合混合高斯表示、图引导属性优化和基于光流的深度正则化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NeRF和3DGS对准确相机位姿和密集视角覆盖的依赖问题，使其在稀疏视角设置下也能可靠应用，其中位姿估计变得不可靠且监督不足。

Method: 1) 使用VGGT基础模型获取可靠初始位姿和密集点云；2) 混合高斯表示结合双位置-形状优化和视图间匹配一致性；3) 图引导属性优化模块增强场景细节；4) 基于光流的深度正则化提高深度估计精度。

Result: 在正向视角和大规模复杂数据集上的综合定量和定性实验表明，相比其他无位姿方法，该方法实现了更鲁棒的性能。

Conclusion: Gesplat框架成功克服了稀疏视角下的位姿估计不可靠和监督不足问题，实现了鲁棒的新视角合成和几何一致重建。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，提出FedCoPL方法，利用CLIP模型通过伪标签分布估计和调整来解决类别不平衡问题，并采用部分提示聚合协议实现有效协作和个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的强大零样本预测能力，将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，解决之前在该范式下不可行的分类任务。

Method: 提出FedCoPL方法：客户端估计并上传伪标签分布，服务器调整并重新分配以避免全局类别不平衡；引入部分提示聚合协议，视觉提示在服务器聚合，文本提示在本地保留以实现个性化。

Result: 大量实验证明FedCoPL相比基线方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 成功将无监督联邦学习应用于分类问题，提出的FedCoPL方法通过伪标签分布调整和部分提示聚合有效解决了类别不平衡问题，实现了良好的协作和个性化效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ACRE方法，通过一致性检查增强强化学习，解决大模型中推理链与最终答案不一致的问题，在视频推理和数学推理任务上分别提升2.2%和1.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR方法虽然能提高答案准确性，但会导致推理步骤与最终答案不一致，在MMVU任务中仅有79.7%的一致性

Method: 修改GRPO算法，加入辅助一致性检查：在模型生成推理链和初始答案后，打乱选项顺序让模型基于相同推理链预测第二个答案，设计一致性验证奖励机制

Result: 在视频推理和数学推理基准测试中，相比GRPO基线分别平均提升2.2%和1.5%

Conclusion: ACRE方法能有效惩罚推理-答案不匹配，减少模型对虚假模式（如选项顺序偏见）的依赖，提高推理一致性

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的后检测框架，通过统计不确定性和视觉特征重新调整检测置信度，提升紧凑深度学习模型在火灾烟雾检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的火灾烟雾检测方法在效率和可靠性之间难以平衡，紧凑模型如YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n在部署时容易出现误报和漏检，传统后处理方法仅依赖空间重叠，在复杂场景中效果有限。

Method: 设计轻量级置信度精炼网络，结合统计不确定性和领域相关的颜色、边缘、纹理特征来调整检测分数，无需修改基础模型。

Result: 在D-Fire数据集上的实验显示，相比现有基线方法，精度、召回率和平均精度均有提升，计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 后检测重评分方法能有效增强紧凑深度学习模型在真实世界火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像篡改技术发展带来安全威胁，需要有效的篡改定位方法。现有监督方法依赖昂贵的像素级标注，而弱监督或无训练方法性能不足且缺乏可解释性。

Method: ICFC框架整合对象化规则构建与自适应过滤来构建可靠知识库，采用多步渐进推理流程模拟专家取证工作流，从粗粒度提案到细粒度取证结果。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ICFC不仅超越最先进的无训练方法，还在弱监督和全监督方法中取得竞争性或更优性能。

Conclusion: ICFC能够系统性地利用MLLM推理能力，实现图像级分类、像素级定位和文本级可解释性，为图像取证提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Motivation: 解决沉浸式应用（如AR/VR）中离轴虹膜识别面临的挑战，包括透视畸变、质量退化和类内变化，现有数据集稀缺且传统方法不适用。

Method: 构建ImmerIris数据集，提出无需归一化的识别范式，直接从眼部图像学习，最小化调整。

Conclusion: 沉浸式虹膜识别需要新的方法范式，无需归一化的直接学习方式在离轴场景中表现更稳健，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

Result: 模型在区分五个严重程度类别方面表现出强大性能

Conclusion: 集成时空表示与注意力机制可以改进自动化PD严重程度检测，有望成为支持临床医生进行PD监测和进展跟踪的非侵入性工具

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Result: 在LOL-v1数据集上，低光增强达到SSIM 92.8%、PSNR 26.30；超分辨率达到PSNR 25.30、SSIM 80.7%，参数分别仅为250万和10万。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在低光增强和超分辨率任务中均表现出色，以较少的参数实现了优越的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi

Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time

YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景，通过平均颜色变化强制多视图一致性，但牺牲了色彩丰富性和可控性。

Method: 仅对单个关键视图着色，然后微调个性化着色器将颜色传播到新视图和时间步，使用Lab色彩空间高斯泼溅表示重建彩色3D场景。

Result: 在多样静态和动态3D着色基准测试中，该方法能提供更一致、色彩丰富的渲染效果，并具有精确的用户控制。

Conclusion: 该框架将复杂的3D着色问题转化为更易处理的单图像范式，允许无缝集成任意图像着色模型，增强了灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

*Benjia Zhou,Bin Fu,Pei Cheng,Yanru Wang,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMix是一个统一的角色一致性生成和编辑框架，包含ReMix模块和IP-ControlNet两个核心组件，解决了现有方法在身份一致性和空间可控性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模文本到图像扩散模型在角色生成和编辑方面存在局限性：生成方法难以保持细粒度身份一致性，编辑方法容易失去空间可控性和指令对齐。需要统一的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: ReMix框架包含两个核心组件：1) ReMix模块利用MLLM的多模态推理能力编辑输入图像的语义特征并适配指令嵌入；2) IP-ControlNet扩展ControlNet，从参考图像解耦语义和布局线索，并在共享噪声空间中联合去噪参考图像和目标图像。

Result: ReMix支持个性化生成、图像编辑、风格迁移和多条件合成等多种任务，实验验证了其作为统一角色一致性图像生成和编辑框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ReMix通过创新的模块设计和受生物学启发的噪声空间机制，成功实现了角色一致性的统一生成和编辑，在保持身份一致性的同时确保了空间可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

*Zhenjie Mao,Yuhuan Yang,Chaofan Ma,Dongsheng Jiang,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SaFiRe框架解决指称图像分割中的歧义表达问题，通过模拟人类两阶段认知过程来处理对象干扰和类别隐式表达，并引入新基准aRefCOCO进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS方法主要处理简单表达式，无法有效应对现实世界中的指称歧义问题，特别是对象干扰表达和类别隐式表达这两种挑战性场景。

Method: 提出SaFiRe框架，模拟人类两阶段认知过程：先形成全局理解，再通过细节导向检查进行精炼。利用Mamba的扫描-更新特性支持多周期精炼，具有线性复杂度。

Result: 在标准数据集和提出的aRefCOCO基准上进行的广泛实验表明，SaFiRe优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: SaFiRe通过模拟人类认知过程有效解决了RIS中的指称歧义问题，在具有挑战性的现实场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: SparseUWSeg是一个用于水下图像语义分割的新框架，通过主动采样策略和混合标签传播方法，在稀疏点标注条件下显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像语义分割对生态监测至关重要，但获取密集专家标注成本高昂，而稀疏点标注虽然易于获取，但面临标注点选择和稀疏信息传播的挑战。

Method: 采用主动采样策略指导标注者选择最有价值的点，然后结合SAM2和超像素方法的混合方法传播稀疏标签。

Result: 在两个不同的水下数据集上，SparseUWSeg相比最先进方法提升了最多5%的mIoU，优于D+NN方法。

Conclusion: 主要贡献是设计并发布了一个简单有效的交互式标注工具，整合了算法，使生态学研究者能够利用基础模型和计算机视觉高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med是一个基于transformer的视觉概念可解释性框架，通过多概念可学习token联合预测和定位视觉概念，在医学应用中提供概念级定位图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念模型将概念视为数值属性，缺乏视觉定位能力，限制了在医疗等高风险场景的实用性。

Method: 使用多概念可学习token，通过专门的注意力层处理视觉和文本概念token，生成概念级定位图。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上，ViConEx-Med在概念检测和定位精度方面优于现有概念模型，与黑盒模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建基于视觉概念的内在可解释模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用物体前后表面和内部的超密集2D-3D对应关系来提升姿态估计精度的方法，通过分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)实现更准确高效的表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注物体前表面的3D坐标预测精度，忽略了后表面和内部结构的潜在价值。为了充分利用物体的完整表面和内部空间，本研究探索了更全面的3D坐标预测策略。

Method: 预测物体前后表面的3D坐标，并在其间密集采样3D坐标，创建超密集2D-3D对应关系。提出分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)来更准确高效地表示前后表面坐标。

Result: 在BOP网站的七个经典核心数据集上，该方法超越了现有的最先进方法，表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用物体完整表面和内部空间创建超密集对应关系，结合提出的HCCE编码方法，能够显著提升基于PnP算法的姿态估计精度。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了无人机视频文本匹配数据集DVTMD和文本条件多粒度对齐框架TCMA，在无人机视频文本检索任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视频数据快速增长，但现有数据集存在标注粗糙冗余的问题，限制了无人机领域文本-视频检索的发展。

Method: 构建了包含2864个视频和14320个细粒度标注的DVTMD数据集，提出了TCMA框架，整合全局视频-句子对齐、句子引导帧聚合和单词引导补丁对齐，并设计了单词和补丁选择模块以及文本自适应动态温度机制。

Result: 在DVTMD和CapERA数据集上建立了首个完整的无人机文本-视频检索基准，TCMA在文本到视频检索中达到45.5% R@1，视频到文本检索中达到42.8% R@1。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和TCMA框架有效解决了无人机视频文本检索问题，为相关应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

*Haohua Dong,Ana Manzano Rodríguez,Camille Guinaudeau,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出pseudo-balancing方法，通过在半监督学习中强制伪标签选择时的人口统计平衡，无需真实标注即可缓解人脸性别分类模型中的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型经常反映并放大训练数据中的人口统计偏见，导致在不同性别和种族子组中表现不均。

Method: 使用伪平衡策略，在伪标签选择时强制人口统计平衡，仅使用种族平衡数据集中的未标注图像，无需真实标注。在两种条件下评估：微调有偏见的性别分类器和使用故意不平衡的训练数据模拟偏见场景。

Result: 伪平衡方法在保持或提高准确性的同时持续改善公平性。总体准确率达到79.81%（比基线提高6.53%），性别准确率差距减少44.17%。在东亚子组中，基线差异超过49%，差距缩小至仅5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在没有标签监督的情况下，访问人口统计平衡或适度倾斜的未标注数据集也可以作为消除现有计算机视觉模型偏见的有力资源。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式关系学习框架，用于3D物体定位，将关系学习从二元扩展到n元，以全局匹配描述中的视觉关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法只建模成对物体关系，忽略了n元组合在多模态关系理解中的全局感知重要性，导致3D-语言对齐困难。

Method: 设计分组监督损失促进n元关系学习，在n元关系构建的场景图中使用具有混合注意力机制的多模态网络进一步定位目标。

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中表现优于现有最先进方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: n元关系学习能够有效提升3D物体定位性能，特别是在处理涉及多个空间关系的复杂描述时。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Conclusion: CerS-Path系统在宫颈专科病理诊断中具有显著优势，有望推动宫颈癌筛查和专科诊断转化。

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个标准化的质量控制工具，能够系统诊断和针对性增强合成数据集，推动数据驱动自动驾驶系统的未来发展。

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: AnomReason和AnomAgent为衡量和改进AIGC图像的语义合理性提供了基础，将发布代码、指标、数据和对齐模型以支持可复现研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

TL;DR: 提出一个改进3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景下效率的框架，通过新的致密化触发机制和保守剪枝策略，显著减少基元数量同时保持重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景下存在过拟合和重建膨胀问题，现有方法虽然提高了质量但显著增加了基元数量，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 用不透明度梯度作为渲染误差的轻量级代理替代位置梯度启发式，采用更保守的剪枝策略防止破坏性优化循环，结合标准深度相关损失提供几何指导

Result: 在3视图LLFF数据集上比FSGS紧凑40%以上（32k vs 57k基元），在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上减少约70%基元数量，重建指标仅有适度下降

Conclusion: 该方法在少样本视图合成的质量-效率帕累托边界上建立了新的最先进水平，实现了紧凑性和重建质量的有效平衡

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

TL;DR: VividAnimator是一个端到端的音频和稀疏手部姿态驱动的人体动画框架，通过预训练手部清晰度码本、双流音频感知模块和姿态校准技巧，解决了现有方法中头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频和姿态驱动的人体动画方法存在头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要原因是音频与头部运动关联性弱，以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 1. 预训练手部清晰度码本(HCC)编码高保真手部纹理先验；2. 双流音频感知模块(DSAA)分别建模唇部同步和自然头部姿态动态；3. 姿态校准技巧(PCT)通过放松刚性约束来优化姿态条件。

Result: 大量实验表明VividAnimator达到最先进性能，生成具有优越手部细节、手势真实性和身份一致性的视频，定量指标和定性评估均验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: VividAnimator通过创新的手部码本、双流音频建模和姿态校准技术，成功解决了音频姿态驱动动画中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的人体动画生成。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的方法通常只依赖透视视图或鸟瞰图特征，无法同时利用细粒度目标细节和空间结构化场景表示，限制了感知性能。

Method: 提出混合检测跟踪框架，结合PV和BEV特征，引入基础模型引导的BEV映射，通过新颖的蒸馏过程将DINOv2特征蒸馏到BEV表示中，使用可变形聚合整合特征。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准测试中实现最先进性能，证明了基础模型BEV映射在自动驾驶感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: DualViewDistill展示了结合PV和BEV特征的混合表示能够提升3D目标检测和跟踪性能，基础模型BEV映射为自动驾驶提供更可靠的感知能力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

TL;DR: SAM2LoRA是一种参数高效微调策略，通过将低秩适配器集成到图像编码器和掩码解码器中，使Segment Anything Model 2能够适应眼底图像分割任务，仅需不到5%的可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2虽然在低资源设置下能够快速推理，但其微调仍然具有挑战性。为了解决这个问题，需要开发一种参数高效的微调方法，使SAM2能够适应眼底图像分割任务。

Method: 在图像编码器和掩码解码器中集成低秩适配器，使用结合分割BCE、SoftDice和FocalTversky损失的复合损失函数进行网络优化。

Result: 在11个具有挑战性的眼底分割数据集上评估，SAM2LoRA在跨数据集训练条件下，在血管和视盘分割方面均表现出高性能，Dice分数分别达到0.86和0.93，AUC值分别达到0.98和0.99。

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA在显著减少训练开销的同时，实现了最先进的性能，为眼底图像分割提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

TL;DR: FactoredScenes是一个通过分解场景为层次化概念来合成真实3D场景的框架，利用房间结构和物体姿态变化生成难以与真实ScanNet场景区分的逼真室内场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景（如ScanNet）难以捕捉且数据有限，生成具有多样化物体姿态的真实场景仍然是一个开放且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入分解表示法，将场景分解为层次化组织的房间程序和物体姿态概念；学习可重用布局模式的函数库；使用大语言模型生成高级程序；学习程序条件模型来分层预测物体姿态；检索并放置3D物体。

Result: FactoredScenes生成了难以与真实ScanNet场景区分的逼真现实世界房间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解场景表示和程序化生成，能够有效合成逼真的3D室内场景，解决了现实场景数据稀缺和物体姿态多样化的挑战。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7

TL;DR: 提出Ortho-Fuse框架，通过光流估计在稀疏航拍图像间合成过渡图像，降低正射影像生成所需的重叠率要求，使AI驱动的作物健康监测系统在资源受限条件下更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影测量需要70-80%的图像重叠率才能保证几何配准精度，但AI系统在资源受限条件下难以达到这一要求，导致重建质量下降，影响农民对自主监测技术的信任度。

Method: 基于光流估计的框架，在连续航拍帧之间合成过渡图像，人为增强特征对应关系，改善几何重建质量。

Result: 实验验证显示最小重叠率要求降低了20%，提高了在低重叠条件下的正射影像生成可靠性。

Conclusion: Ortho-Fuse框架通过降低重叠率要求，有助于克服精准农业中AI驱动监测系统的采用障碍，促进技术集成。

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

Method: 提出PointMAC框架，使用元辅助学习策略，在测试时通过优化两个自监督辅助目标（模拟结构和传感器级不完整性）来自适应调整共享编码器，同时引入自适应λ校准机制来平衡主任务和辅助目标的梯度。

Result: 在合成、模拟和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，PointMAC通过为每个样本单独优化实现了最先进的点云补全质量。

Conclusion: PointMAC是首个将元辅助测试时自适应应用于点云补全的工作，能够有效提升模型对未知结构和传感器失真的鲁棒性，生成高质量补全结果。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了CNN在图像分类中存在的隐藏偏见问题，提出了两种方法来区分上下文信息和背景噪声，无需使用背景信息即可检测背景噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN作为黑盒模型难以确定哪些特征最具影响力，决策过程可能受到难以检测的背景信息偏见影响，需要识别这些隐藏偏见。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）将图像分割成随机打乱的非重叠小块；2）应用傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波器等图像变换来恢复CNN用于分类的背景噪声信息。

Result: 在六个不同数据集（自然、合成和混合数据集）上测试，该方法能有效区分上下文信息和背景噪声，并在无需背景信息的情况下检测背景噪声。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效识别CNN分类中的背景噪声偏见，有助于理解模型的决策过程并检测潜在的偏见问题。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait通过创新的中间3D热图表示，成功结合了2D和3D模态的优势，在计算效率和识别精度之间取得了良好平衡，为步态识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: 提出的结合特征空间顺序和渐进式匹配的方法能够有效提高图像特征匹配的效率和准确性，特别是在处理大量特征点时表现优异。

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合2D时间轮廓和3D SMPL特征的多模态多任务步态识别框架，通过统一transformer融合特征，同时进行身份识别和人体属性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前步态识别方法通常只关注2D或3D单一模态，无法充分捕捉人类行走模式的几何和动态复杂性。

Method: 使用多模态多任务框架，结合2D时间轮廓和3D SMPL特征，通过统一transformer融合特征，同时进行步态识别和年龄、BMI、性别等人体属性估计。

Result: 在BRIAR大规模数据集上（包含长距离和极端俯仰角等挑战性条件）的实验表明，该方法在步态识别和人体属性估计方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 多模态和多任务学习为现实场景中基于步态的人类理解提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR技术的快速发展，晕动症问题持续阻碍其广泛应用。现有研究主要关注多模态深度学习方法，但对基于视频特征预测晕动症的研究有限。

Method: 使用在ImageNet数据集上预训练的InceptionV3模型提取VR游戏视频的高级视觉特征，然后通过LSTM网络捕捉VR体验的时间动态特征来预测晕动症严重程度。

Result: 该方法实现了68.4%的晕动症严重程度分类准确率，超越了仅使用视频数据训练的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为VR开发者提供了评估和减轻虚拟环境中晕动症的实用工具，并为未来基于视频的时间建模研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG是一个模仿人类视觉推理的多模态检索增强生成框架，通过'什么-哪里-重加权'级联方法解决MLLMs在细粒度视觉问答中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中经常产生关于物体身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参照物。现有的检索增强生成方法缺乏局部细节和对细粒度交互的推理。

Method: 采用'什么-哪里-重加权'级联方法：首先通过开放词汇检测锚定候选参照物（什么），然后用SAM生成的掩码进行空间解析以恢复细粒度精度（哪里），最后通过局部和全局对齐的权衡进行自适应优先级排序（重加权）。通过掩码引导的微调将空间证据注入生成过程。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，这种人类级联方法提高了接地保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉，推动了多模态问答向可信推理发展。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG框架通过模仿人类视觉推理过程，显著改善了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中的性能，将接地从被动偏见转变为答案制定的显式约束。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion是一个单目SE(3)扩散框架，通过条件去噪扩散过程实现无标记、基于图像的机器人姿态估计，在DREAM和RoboKeyGen基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定尺度扰动生成训练姿态，缺乏多样性和视野内约束，限制了网络泛化能力。需要一种能够生成多样化且在相机视野内的训练姿态的方法。

Method: 框架包含两个过程：1) 可见性约束扩散过程，逐步扰动真实姿态为噪声变换，确保变换保持在相机视野内；2) 时间步感知反向过程，通过去噪网络迭代预测姿态，并按照粗到细程序进行姿态精炼。

Result: 在两个基准测试(DREAM和RoboKeyGen)上均取得改进，在最具挑战性的数据集上达到66.75的AUC，比现有最优方法提升32.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散过程生成多样化训练姿态，结合时间步感知精炼方案，实现了比直接预测更高的鲁棒性和准确性，显著提升了单目机器人姿态估计性能。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于表示的方法在处理一致性异常（在多个图像中重复出现的相似缺陷）时表现不佳，导致异常分类和分割性能下降。

Method: CoDeGraph算法构建图像级图结构，将图像作为节点，连接具有共享一致性异常模式的图像，利用社区检测技术过滤这些异常。基于极值理论提供理论支撑。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ViT-L-14-336骨干网络实现98.3%的AUROC，异常分割F1分数达到66.8%（提升4.2%），AP达到68.1%（提升5.4%）。使用DINOv2骨干网络进一步将分割F1提升至69.1%（提升6.5%），AP提升至71.9%（提升9.2%）。

Conclusion: CoDeGraph算法有效解决了零样本异常检测中的一致性异常问题，在不同骨干网络架构下均表现出鲁棒性，显著提升了异常分类和分割性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割标注存在标注者间差异性(IRV)问题，传统方法简单平均专家标签会丢弃临床不确定性信息，需要一种能利用专家分歧的新方法。

Method: 使用群体决策模拟框架，包括专家签名生成器(ESG)学习个体标注者风格，模拟咨询模块(SCM)从潜在空间智能采样生成最终分割结果。

Result: 在CBCT和MRI数据集上分别达到92.11%和90.72%的Dice分数，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声，为构建更稳健和可信的医疗AI系统提供了清晰路径。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型(VLM)存在严重幻觉问题，生成的回答虽然语言流畅但与图像内容无关。语言偏差是导致幻觉的主要原因。

Method: 通过自适应掩码最具影响力的图像token的注意力权重来降解视觉-语言感知，利用原始模型与降解后模型的输出分布差异进行解码。

Result: CMG显著减少了语言偏差，在幻觉特定基准测试中提升了不同VLM的性能，且能有效泛化。

Conclusion: CMG是一种无需训练的解码方法，能有效解决VLM的幻觉问题，强调视觉上下文感知而不损害模型能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

Motivation: 现有伪图像表示方法在处理非结构化点云时往往忽略点云的结构和语义细节，导致特征融合和判别性受限。

Method: 1. 全局-局部特征融合编码模块增强局部特征相关性并捕获全局上下文；2. 多分支特征提取网络捕获更多邻域信息并增强轮廓特征判别性；3. 深度特征引导注意力机制提升跨通道特征融合精度。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes验证集上分别达到69.83%和78.65%的准确率，平衡了高性能与实时能力。

Conclusion: DAGLFNet在LiDAR点云语义分割中表现出色，具有实时应用潜力。

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决微手势识别中现有方法的局限性：CNN难以捕捉长程依赖，Transformer计算成本高，而vanilla Mamba缺乏局部时空建模能力和运动感知设计。

Method: 提出MSF-Mamba模型，引入基于中心帧差分的运动感知状态融合模块来融合局部上下文相邻状态，还提出了多尺度版本MSF-Mamba+，支持多尺度运动感知状态融合和自适应尺度加权。

Result: 在两个公开微手势识别数据集上的实验表明，即使是轻量级版本MSF-Mamba也实现了最先进性能，优于现有的CNN、Transformer和SSM模型，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba通过运动感知局部时空建模有效捕捉微手势识别中的细微运动线索，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型确实具备自我精炼能力，这项研究为理解VLMs的学习机制提供了新的见解，有望启发未来相关研究。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.

generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D是一个基于多视角扩散模型的3D风格迁移方法，通过拼图操作解耦风格与内容，实现快速、视角一致的3D资产风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D风格迁移方法存在两个主要问题：依赖直接参考风格标记注入或2D扩散模型的分数蒸馏，导致每场景优化成本高，且风格与语义内容容易纠缠。

Method: 使用拼图操作（空间打乱和随机掩码参考图像块）来抑制对象语义并分离风格统计特征，通过参考到视角的交叉注意力将这些风格线索集成到多视角扩散模型中。

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，延迟显著降低，并能推广到掩码部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成。

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D提供了一种有效的3D风格迁移解决方案，成功解耦了风格与内容，实现了快速且视角一致的3D资产风格化。

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: VR-Thinker是一个思考式图像框架，通过视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口，让多模态奖励模型能够主动获取和更新视觉证据，在上下文限制内提高推理保真度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态奖励模型面临两个固有局限：(1)视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算，导致帧数减少和细粒度细节丢失；(2)所有视觉信息都打包到初始提示中，在思维链推理过程中加剧幻觉和遗忘问题。

Method: 采用强化微调流程：冷启动使用精选的视觉思维链数据蒸馏基本推理技能和操作格式化；选择所有维度判断都正确的样本进行拒绝采样微调；应用组相对策略优化来加强推理能力。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中达到最先进准确率：7B VR-Thinker在VideoGen Reward上达到80.5%，GenAI-Bench上82.3%，MJ-Bench-Video上75.6%，特别在长视频上表现优异。

Conclusion: 结果验证了思考式图像多模态奖励建模的有效性和前景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的查找表方法，通过自适应量化、不规则空洞卷积和U型级联结构来扩展CNN感受野，在保持相同空间复杂度的情况下提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法由于表大小组合爆炸导致卷积核感受野受限，需要在不增加表大小的情况下扩展CNN感受野。

Method: 学习最优格点向量量化器自适应分配量化分辨率，采用不规则空洞卷积和U型级联LUT结构捕获多级上下文信息。

Result: 有效平衡了速度、精度和内存效率，相比现有LUT方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多种创新技术成功扩展了CNN感受野，在固定表大小下提升了LUT驱动的快速CNN推理性能。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Motivation: 解决先前开放词汇分割和上下文分割方法在架构差异、学习目标和表示学习策略上的不一致问题，实现统一的多模态分割框架。

Method: 使用基础模型提取图像和多模态提示的表示，通过SegDecoder对齐这些表示、建模交互，并生成不同粒度的指定掩码。

Conclusion: COSINE成功统一了开放词汇分割和上下文分割，证明了多模态提示协同的有效性，为开世界分割提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: 将模式分析嵌入识别阶段，有效融合计算机视觉和语言建模，为智能交通和监控应用提供了更强的适应性。

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中缺失模态的不平衡会导致恶性循环：缺失率高的模态更新次数少，学习进度不一致，特征表示退化，进一步降低其贡献

Method: MCE包含两个协同组件：LCE通过多级因子动态平衡模态特定学习进度；RCE通过子集预测和跨模态补全任务提升特征语义和鲁棒性

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试上的综合评估表明，MCE在各种缺失配置下始终优于最先进方法

Conclusion: MCE有效解决了多模态学习中缺失模态的不平衡问题，通过动态平衡学习进度和增强特征表示实现了性能提升

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

Motivation: 冰川湖溃决洪水是高山地区罕见但破坏性强的灾害，现有研究受限于碎片化和单模态数据，缺乏用于预测的统一数据集。

Method: 整合三种互补数据源：Sentinel-2用于空间监测、NASA ITS_LIVE用于冰川运动学、MODIS用于地表温度记录。预处理包括云掩膜、质量过滤、归一化、时间插值、数据增强和循环编码，最后进行多模态数据协调。

Conclusion: GLOFNet通过解决类别不平衡、云污染和粗分辨率等挑战，为罕见灾害预测的多模态深度学习方法提供了结构化基准测试基础。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway

Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines

Motivation: 现有tokenizer在视觉理解与生成任务之间存在显著性能权衡，因为高层语义抽象与低层像素重建存在内在冲突。需要开发一个能同时胜任理解和生成任务的统一tokenizer。

Conclusion: UniFlow成功解决了视觉理解与生成任务的性能权衡问题，实现了统一建模的双赢结果，为通用视觉建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Conclusion: Diff-ABFlow框架通过扩散模型和帧-事件融合，克服了传统方法在退化场景中的局限性，为高速和低光环境下的光流估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: FSVG方法通过简单的特征选择机制，实现了视觉定位任务中准确性和效率的更好平衡。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ViSurf统一后训练范式，将监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RLVR)的优势整合到单阶段训练中，通过注入真实标签到RLVR轨迹中，同时提供外部监督和内部强化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练方法存在局限性：SFT导致次优性能，RLVR在处理超出模型知识范围的任务时表现不佳。需要一种能结合两者优势的统一方法。

Method: 推导SFT和RLVR目标建立ViSurf目标，在RLVR轨迹中注入真实标签实现同时监督和强化，并引入三种新的奖励控制策略来稳定优化训练过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ViSurf优于单独的SFT、RLVR以及两阶段SFT→RLVR方法。

Conclusion: ViSurf提供了一种有效的统一后训练范式，验证了其推导和设计原则的有效性。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

TL;DR: OmniQuality-R是一个统一奖励建模框架，将多任务质量推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，用于策略优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉评估方法通常局限于单一任务，需要解决多任务质量评估的统一框架问题。

Method: 通过拒绝采样构建推理增强的奖励建模数据集，应用Group Relative Policy Optimization进行后训练，结合标准差过滤和熵门控机制稳定训练。

Result: 在三个关键IQA任务（美学质量评估、技术质量评估和图文对齐）上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 该框架能够将多维推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，支持策略优化。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架，通过增强线性注意力机制的秩和焦点来解决其表达能力不足的问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时提升图分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性注意力模型由于低秩投影结构和过于均匀的注意力分布，导致表达能力显著下降，限制了节点表示的分类能力。

Method: 提出混合框架：1）在值矩阵上附加门控局部图网络分支以增强注意力图的秩；2）在注意力分数中引入可学习的对数幂函数来降低熵并锐化焦点。

Result: 在同质性和异质性图基准测试中，该方法实现了有竞争力的性能，同时保持了线性注意力的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了线性注意力的表达能力限制问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了图分类性能。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Motivation: 尽管基于扩散的生成模型在音频驱动的说话头部生成方面进展迅速，但生成具有细粒度运动控制的时间一致视频仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出运动自编码器构建结构化潜在空间，其中运动因子独立表示并近似正交化。在该解耦运动空间上应用基于最优传输的流匹配与transformer预测器，生成基于音频条件的时间平滑运动轨迹。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DEMO在视频真实感、唇音同步和运动保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 将细粒度运动解耦与基于流的生成建模相结合，为可控说话头部视频合成提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Motivation: 传统基于示例的角点案例分类方法不可扩展且缺乏数据覆盖视角，无法泛化到机器学习模型的训练数据，需要一种考虑底层数据分布的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于数据分布视角的机器学习方法，构建了有效的角点案例识别框架，并扩展了标准分布外检测基准。

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

Motivation: 利用大量未标记的真实人脸数据，学习鲁棒且可迁移的面部表示，以提升在各种人脸安全任务中的泛化性能。

Method: 提出3C学习目标：使用CRFR-P掩码策略实现区域一致性和连贯性，结合掩码图像建模和实例判别，通过自蒸馏机制建立局部到全局的对应关系。

Result: 在11个公共基准测试中，FS-VFM在跨数据集深度伪造检测、跨域人脸反欺骗和未见扩散模型面部取证等任务中，比多种视觉基础模型和特定任务方法表现更好。

Conclusion: FS-VFM提供了一个可扩展的自监督预训练框架，能够学习通用的人脸表示，FS-Adapter提供了高效的迁移学习方法，在人脸安全任务中实现了优异的性能-效率权衡。

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

Conclusion: 动作动态学习和跨时间交互对于动作理解研究具有重要意义，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够有效处理不同类型的模糊，通过可靠的模糊核估计和动态高斯致密化策略实现高质量动态高斯溅射

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR/AR系统需要智能适应用户行为以增强交互体验，这要求准确理解人类意图和预测未来情境行为（如注视方向和物体交互），但现有方法缺乏对驱动人-环境交互的底层认知过程的建模。

Method: 提出分层意图感知框架，基于历史人类动态和场景上下文，首先识别潜在交互目标，然后预测细粒度未来行为；使用动态图卷积网络(GCN)有效捕捉人-环境关系。

Result: 在具有挑战性的真实世界基准测试和实时VR环境中进行广泛实验，该方法在所有指标上均取得优越性能，能够实现预测用户行为和自适应虚拟环境的实际应用。

Conclusion: 该框架通过建模认知机制有效预测人类意图和情境行为，为主动式VR系统提供了实用解决方案，能够预见用户行为并相应调整虚拟环境。

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

### [118] [Uncovering Anomalous Events for Marine Environmental Monitoring via Visual Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10750)
*Laura Weihl,Nejc Novak,Stefan H. Bengtson,Malte Pedersen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AURA数据集，这是首个用于水下视觉异常检测的多标注者基准数据集，并评估了四种VAD模型在两种海洋场景中的表现，强调鲁棒帧选择策略的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下视频监测是评估海洋生物多样性的有前景策略，但大量无事件视频使人工检查极不实用，需要自动识别有趣或异常事件的方法。

Method: 引入AURA多标注者基准数据集，评估四种基于深度神经网络的水下视觉异常检测模型，采用鲁棒帧选择策略提取有意义的视频片段。

Result: 当前VAD模型的性能差异显著，对训练数据量和定义"正常"场景的视觉内容变异性高度敏感。软标签和共识标签具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 研究为支持科学探索和可扩展的生物多样性监测提供了实用方法，强调了VAD在水下视频分析中的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于人脸相似度度量的可解释方法，将全局相似度分解为局部补丁的贡献，无需后处理分析即可提供局部可加性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可靠的评估指标，后处理方法对模型实际推理过程的忠实度存在不确定性，这促使设计具有内在可解释决策过程的模型。

Method: 定义两个人脸图像的相似度为补丁级相似度得分的总和，将全局相似度分解为受限感受野的贡献。

Result: 在112x112人脸图像中使用小至28x28的补丁时仍能实现有竞争力的验证性能，使用56x56补丁时超越了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法提供了一种内在可解释的人脸相似度度量，通过局部可加性解释实现了竞争性性能。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的2.5D方法，将3D胸部CT表示为结构化图，通过谱图卷积处理轴向切片三元组，在保持临床部署兼容性的同时捕获切片间依赖关系。


<details>

Motivation: 随着CT检查量增加，需要自动化工具支持放射科医生。现有3D CNN方法难以捕获长距离依赖，而Vision Transformers需要大量领域特定预训练。

Method: 将3D CT体积表示为结构化图，轴向切片三元组作为节点，通过谱图卷积处理，能够推理切片间依赖关系。

Result: 在3个独立机构的数据集上训练和评估，实现了强大的跨数据集泛化能力，与最先进的视觉编码器相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持临床部署兼容性的同时，有效解决了3D胸部CT多标签分类的挑战，并展示了在放射学报告生成和腹部CT数据上的广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像合成质量受颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象影响，这些现象在不同水域表现为不同的风格变化。现有生成模型难以建模多样化水下环境的非均匀条件。

Method: 使用K-means聚类将数据集划分为风格特定域，采用分离编码器获取风格和内容的潜在空间，通过AdaIN集成这些表示并解码生成最终合成图像。每个风格聚类独立训练以保持域特定特征。

Result: 模型取得最先进性能：SSIM为0.9012，平均PSNR为32.5118 dB，FID为13.3728。

Conclusion: DISC-GAN框架成功实现了高质量的水下图像合成，通过风格-内容解耦和聚类特定训练策略有效处理了水下环境的多样性问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

TL;DR: 提出了imHead，一种新颖的隐式3D可变形模型，能够建模表达性3D头部化身并支持面部特征的局部编辑，通过引入区域特定潜在表示实现紧凑的身份空间和局部编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D可变形模型依赖严格拓扑结构和线性性质，难以表示复杂的全头形状。现有方法将潜在空间划分为局部组件，导致潜在尺寸过大。

Method: 保留单一紧凑身份空间，引入中间区域特定潜在表示来实现局部编辑。使用大规模4K个不同身份的数据集进行训练。

Result: 模型能够表示多样化的身份和表情，性能优于先前方法。提供了可解释的3D面部操作解决方案，支持用户进行局部编辑。

Conclusion: imHead在3D头部建模方面表现出强大的表达能力，同时提供直观的局部编辑功能，为大规模3D头部建模迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的公开分割标注对于图像处理领域至关重要，特别是对于大量目标的体积图像标注既耗时又具有挑战性。

Method: 三名独立标注者对Cell Tracking Challenge中的MDA231人类乳腺癌细胞序列进行全3D时间推移分割标注，并与CTC提供的自动标注进行比较。

Result: 创建的标注与CTC先前发布的跟踪标记一致，分割精度在标注者间变异性范围内，且比CTC的自动标注更好地反映了输入图像的复杂性。

Conclusion: 该数据集可用于细胞分割的测试和训练，以及分析高度动态物体的3D形状。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在提高胸部X光诊断准确性的同时，可能在人口统计学群体间存在性能差异，从而加剧医疗保健不平等。

Method: 扩展CNN-XGBoost管道以支持多标签分类，用XGBoost替换CNN的最后一层，并在DenseNet-121和ResNet-50等不同骨干网络上验证方法的通用性。

Result: 该方法在保持或提高整体预测性能的同时改善了子群体的公平性，与对抗训练、重加权、数据增强和主动学习等传统方法相比，能以更低的计算成本实现竞争性或更优的偏见减少。

Conclusion: 将XGBoost重训练与主动学习相结合，在所有人口统计学子群体中实现了最大的偏见减少，为临床放射学中公平深度学习部署提供了实用有效的路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Motivation: 现有基于transformer的3D人体网格恢复模型计算成本高且复杂，存在深度架构和冗余令牌问题

Method: 使用ECLM选择性合并对MPJPE影响最小的transformer层，Mask-ToMe合并对预测贡献小的背景令牌，并采用基于扩散的解码器利用时间上下文和姿态先验

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现2.3倍加速，性能略有提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了计算复杂度，在保持甚至提升性能的同时显著加速3D人体网格恢复

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型发展迅速，但其在开放世界条件下进行图像地理定位的能力尚未得到全面评估，而这一任务在现实生活中具有挑战性和实际需求。

Method: 构建包含810张全球分布图像的EarthWhere基准，分为WhereCountry（500个选择题，国家级别）和WhereStreet（310个街道级别任务，需要多步推理和可选网络搜索）。采用最终预测指标和中间推理链评分方法，包括人类验证的关键视觉线索和Shapley重新加权的思维评分。

Result: 评估了13个最先进的视觉语言模型，Gemini-2.5-Pro达到最佳平均准确率56.32%，最强的开源模型GLM-4.5V达到34.71%。研究发现网络搜索和推理在视觉线索有限时不能保证性能提升，模型存在区域偏见，某些区域得分比其他区域高42.7%。

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅显示了模型的潜力，也突显了在减轻偏见和实现稳健、细粒度定位方面存在的持续挑战。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

TL;DR: ToMCLIP是一个拓扑感知的多语言CLIP框架，通过拓扑保持约束对齐嵌入空间，解决了多语言视觉-语言模型中跨模态对齐偏向英语的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言视觉-语言模型虽然缓解了跨模态对齐偏向英语的问题，但只关注实例级对齐而忽略了共享嵌入空间的全局几何结构。

Method: 提出拓扑对齐损失，使用持久同调定义，并通过图稀疏化策略近似持久图，具有理论误差界限。

Result: 实验验证了该方法能增强多语言表示的结构一致性，在CIFAR-100上获得更高的零样本准确率，在xFlickr&CO上实现更强的多语言检索性能。

Conclusion: ToMCLIP不仅提升了多语言视觉-语言模型的性能，还为表示学习提供了一种通用的拓扑对齐方法。

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法通常局限于内容替换和简单风格，缺乏自由风格迁移能力，无法实现灵活和局部化的文本风格编辑。

Method: 设计特征注入模块利用扩散模型反演和自注意力有效传递风格特征；引入区域控制机制通过距离变化掩码实现精确空间控制；基于傅里叶变换的风格增强模块提升风格丰富度。

Result: 在场景文本风格转换方面取得优越性能，在视觉保真度和文本保持方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现灵活、高保真的场景文本风格转换，同时保持文本可读性和风格一致性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2是一个双语视觉语言模型，通过细粒度监督和文本模态内对比损失，在英语和中文上实现了先进的细粒度对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在细粒度视觉语言理解方面存在局限，特别是在非英语环境下，难以捕捉对象属性、空间关系和语言表达的细微差别，且双语理解能力有限。

Method: 采用区域-文本匹配和长文本建模等细粒度监督，结合多种判别性目标，并引入文本模态内对比损失来区分语义相似的描述。

Result: 在29个数据集和8个任务上的广泛实验表明，FG-CLIP 2在两种语言上都超越了现有方法，取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2通过精心设计的训练策略和新的中文多模态理解基准，显著提升了双语细粒度对齐能力，为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

TL;DR: DKPMV是一种仅使用多视角RGB图像进行6D位姿估计的管道，通过密集关键点级融合和三阶段渐进式位姿优化策略，在纹理缺失物体上超越了现有RGB方法和大多数RGB-D方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纹理缺失物体6D位姿估计中深度信息丢失的问题，当前多视角方法要么依赖深度数据，要么未能充分利用多视角几何线索，限制了性能。

Method: 设计三阶段渐进式位姿优化策略，利用密集多视角关键点几何信息；通过注意力聚合和对称感知训练增强关键点网络，提高预测精度并解决对称物体的模糊性问题。

Result: 在ROBI数据集上的大量实验表明，DKPMV优于最先进的多视角RGB方法，在大多数情况下甚至超过了RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: 仅使用RGB图像就能实现高质量的6D位姿估计，为工业机器人应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需校准的实例级不确定性指标，用于检测生成模型在逆问题重建中的分布偏移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型作为数据驱动先验在逆问题中表现出色，但当测试图像超出训练分布时可能产生幻觉特征。现有不确定性量化方法需要校准数据集、提供启发式估计或无法专门检测分布偏移

Method: 利用重建稳定性作为分布偏移的代理指标，假设分布内图像重建在随机测量变化下保持稳定，而分布外图像重建更不稳定

Result: 在MNIST数字断层重建实验中，仅用数字"0"训练的模型在所有十个数字上测试，分布外数字重建显示出更高的变异性和重建误差

Conclusion: 提出将生成先验与轻量级防护措施结合的策略，可在分布内情况下实现激进测量减少，同时在先验应用于分布外时自动发出警告

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

TL;DR: 提出IUT-Plug模块，通过图像理解树增强现有交错视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、对象身份和风格上下文漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图像-文本生成中难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格一致性，限制了在复杂多模态场景中的泛化能力

Method: 两阶段框架：动态IUT-Plug提取模块将视觉场景解析为层次符号结构；协调的叙事流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性

Result: 实验表明IUT-Plug不仅提高了现有基准的准确性，还有效缓解了三种关键上下文漂移形式

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过显式结构化推理显著改善了视觉语言模型在多模态问答场景中的性能

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

TL;DR: Chart-RVR是一个通过可验证奖励和组相对策略优化来微调大型视觉语言模型的框架，旨在提高图表推理的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图表推理任务上表现出色，但在分布外数据上表现不佳，且生成思维链时性能下降，限制了可解释性。

Method: 使用组相对策略优化(GRPO)结合三个自动可验证奖励：正确图表类型分类、忠实图表表格重建和过程一致性，对30亿参数LVLM进行微调。

Result: Chart-RVR在分布内和分布外数据集上均优于标准监督微调，在六个图表推理基准测试中达到最先进水平，超越了同等规模的所有现有模型。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR通过可验证奖励和GRPO训练出了可靠、可解释的图表推理模型，提高了思维链的可解释性，增强了信任和可靠性。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态视频理解中，模型容易过拟合强模态，导致弱模态贡献被抑制，需要解决模态不平衡问题。

Method: MM在多模态特征层面应用Mixup策略生成虚拟特征-标签对；B-MM在此基础上根据各模态对学习目标的贡献动态调整混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，这些方法能有效提升泛化性能和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的MM和B-MM方法成功缓解了多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，提高了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at
https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained

requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting

Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多实例图像生成中存在关键限制，难以实现对对象布局的精确控制以及保持多个不同主体的身份一致性。

Method: 提出了ContextGen框架，包含两个关键技术贡献：1）上下文布局锚定(CLA)机制，将复合布局图像整合到生成上下文中以稳固锚定对象位置；2）身份一致性注意力(ICA)机制，利用上下文参考图像确保多个实例的身份一致性。同时构建了IMIG-100K数据集。

Conclusion: ContextGen通过创新的CLA和ICA机制，结合新构建的数据集，有效解决了多实例图像生成中的布局控制和身份保持问题，为相关领域提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在复杂低对比度背景下难以聚焦前景区域，特别是当恶性肿瘤与正常器官相似时，上下文区分变得困难。

Method: 1. 前景感知模块放大背景与整个体积空间的差异；2. 基于小波变换的特征级频率增强模块提取判别性高频特征；3. 边缘约束模块保持分割边界的几何连续性。

Result: 在多个医学数据集上的实验显示，所有指标均表现出优越性能，特别是在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和精细结构识别方面。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了低对比度图像的分割效果，为更复杂多样的医学成像场景应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在弱点，现有方法要么资源密集，要么缺乏可解释的推理过程

Method: 使用从大型语言模型学习得到的神经符号概念树来增强VLM输出，采用波束搜索启发的推理过程

Result: 在四个组合性基准测试中，七个不同规模的开源VLM上，组合泛化性能提升5-10%

Conclusion: COCO-Tree方法有效提升了VLM的组合推理能力，同时提供了可解释的推理过程

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

Motivation: 现有VHPE方法难以平衡全局动态上下文和局部运动细节的建模，且存在二次复杂度问题。Mamba模型在长序列建模方面有潜力但仅限于1D数据。

Method: 提出全局时空Mamba进行6D选择性时空扫描和调制扫描合并来提取全局表示，以及基于窗口化时空扫描的局部细化Mamba来增强关键点运动的高频细节。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该模型优于最先进的VHPE方法，同时实现了更好的计算权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架成功扩展了Mamba模型，能够有效平衡全局和局部时空建模，为高分辨率视频人体姿态估计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

TL;DR: 提出GeoVLMath模型，通过文本描述辅助线构造而非图像编辑来解决几何问题，使用强化学习框架提升图文对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大视觉语言模型在解决复杂几何问题时，绘制辅助线存在困难，图像编辑模型难以保证几何精度，因此转向文本描述方式。

Method: 提出强化学习框架，通过跨模态奖励评估生成的辅助线描述与真实辅助线图的对齐程度，基于GRPO的强化学习阶段实现精确的图文对齐。

Result: 构建了AuxSolidMath数据集（3,018个真实考试几何问题），在3B和7B规模下，GeoVLMath在辅助线推理基准测试中表现优于开源和专有LVLM模型。

Conclusion: 文本描述辅助线构造的方法有效解决了LVLM在几何问题中的局限性，GeoVLMath模型在辅助线推理任务上取得了竞争优势。

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: GIR-Bench是一个全面的多模态基准测试，从三个互补角度评估统一模型：理解-生成一致性、推理驱动的文本到图像生成、以及多步推理编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社区缺乏严格的以推理为中心的基准来系统评估多模态模型中理解与生成之间的对齐关系及其在复杂视觉任务中的泛化潜力。

Method: 设计了三个子集：GIR-Bench-UGC评估理解-生成一致性，GIR-Bench-T2I评估需要逻辑约束和隐式知识的推理驱动图像生成，GIR-Bench-Edit评估多步推理编辑。每个子集都有专门设计的评估流程。

Result: 尽管统一模型在推理驱动的视觉任务中表现更好，但它们仍然表现出理解与生成之间的持续差距。

Conclusion: GIR-Bench提供了一个细粒度和可解释的评估框架，揭示了当前统一多模态模型在理解与生成对齐方面的局限性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Conclusion: Vlaser成功桥接了具身推理与VLA策略学习，为缓解互联网规模预训练数据与具身特定策略学习数据之间的领域偏移提供了新见解。

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

Motivation: 基础模型在零样本异常分割任务中表现出强大的泛化能力，但如何正确引导这些模型解决下游任务仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) Co-Feature点提示生成模块，利用CLIP和SAM协作生成正负点提示；2) 级联提示模块，使用混合提示与SAM轻量级解码器级联，优化分割结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，实现了最先进的零样本异常分割结果，在Visa数据集上F1-max和AP指标分别比现有最佳方法高出10.3%和7.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合了CLIP和SAM的优势，通过创新的提示生成和优化策略，在工业异常检测中实现了优异的零样本异常分割性能。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

Motivation: 喉癌影像研究缺乏标准化数据集，难以实现可复现的深度学习模型开发。

Method: 从TCIA收集6个数据集的1029个CT扫描，使用弱监督参数搜索框架提取喉部感兴趣区域。评估3D CNN、ResNet18/50/101和DenseNet121在早期vs晚期和T4 vs非T4分类任务上的性能，使用3D GradCAM进行模型可解释性分析。

Result: 3D CNN在早期vs晚期分类任务中表现最佳（AUC-0.881，F1-macro-0.821），ResNet18在T4 vs非T4分类中表现最佳（AUC-0.892，F1-macro-0.646）。可解释性分析显示非T4病例中模型更关注软骨周围区域，T4预测中显示局部激活。

Conclusion: LaryngealCT通过开源数据、预训练模型和集成可解释性工具，为AI驱动的喉癌研究提供了可复现的基础，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated
explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for

Motivation: 现有的文本引导扩散模型在真实人脸编辑任务中难以保持ID和结构一致性，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 使用ID-属性解耦反演技术，将人脸表征分解为ID和属性特征，作为反演和反向扩散过程的联合条件，实现独立控制。

Result: 方法支持仅使用文本提示完成复杂多属性人脸编辑任务，无需区域特定输入，速度与DDIM反演相当，实验证明其实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持ID一致性和结构一致性的同时，实现了精确的面部属性操作，为文本引导的人脸编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

Motivation: 推动视频目标分割在真实场景中的鲁棒性，超越精心设计的基准测试，应对更复杂和现实的挑战。

Method: 挑战赛包含三个赛道：传统VOS、Referring VOS和新增的MOSEv2。MOSEv2引入了更密集的小目标、频繁消失/重现事件、严重遮挡、恶劣天气和光照等挑战性场景。

Result: 挑战赛使用标准J、F、J&F指标评估VOS和RVOS，MOSEv2采用J&Ḟ作为主要排名指标以更好地评估跨尺度和消失情况的目标。

Conclusion: 总结了数据集和协议，突出顶级解决方案，提炼出LLM/MLLM组件和内存感知传播等新兴趋势，旨在为野外鲁棒、语言感知的视频分割指明未来方向。

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Motivation: 现有源自由目标检测方法主要针对传统检测模型如Faster R-CNN，缺乏对DETR等新型检测架构的专门适配，需要为DETR设计专门的源自由目标检测解决方案。

Method: 包含四个关键组件：基于目标性得分的样本重加权模块、基于匹配记忆库的对比学习模块、不确定性加权的查询融合特征蒸馏模块，以及改进的自训练流程。

Conclusion: FRANCK能够有效将源域预训练的DETR模型适配到目标域，具有增强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Method: 构建几何和文本基元的统一表示，使用预训练CNN提取视觉特征作为初始表示，采用基于Transformer的主干网络，并增强类型感知注意力机制来显式建模不同类型基元间的空间依赖关系。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在涉及文本标注的符号识别任务上优于现有方法，并在复杂CAD图纸上表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的结合文本标注的全景符号识别框架能够更全面地理解CAD图纸，通过联合建模几何和文本信息以及显式关系建模，显著提升了符号识别的性能。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法通常依赖当前场景上下文，低估了场景动态及其时间演化的重要性，限制了在复杂驾驶场景中做出自适应决策的能力。

Method: 提出SeerDrive框架，包含两个关键组件：(1)未来感知规划，将预测的BEV特征注入轨迹规划器；(2)迭代场景建模和车辆规划，通过协作优化同时改进未来场景预测和轨迹生成。

Result: 在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SeerDrive显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 未来自动驾驶车辆轨迹与环境动态演化密切相关，双向关系建模能够提升决策的适应性和准确性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪方法为多模态防御提供了有效解决方案，有助于多模态大语言模型在现实应用中的可靠和安全部署。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to

*Jiahui Lei,Kyle Genova,George Kopanas,Noah Snavely,Leonidas Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从真实世界视频中学习3D运动先验的方法，使用像素对齐的运动图表示和扩散模型来从单张图像预测未来3D场景运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张输入图像预测未来3D场景运动的挑战，需要学习语义和功能上有意义的3D运动先验。

Method: 提出像素对齐的运动图表示，从5万+真实视频创建大规模MoMap数据库，并训练扩散模型进行运动生成。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能生成合理且语义一致的3D场景运动。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅合成3D轨迹，还提出了新的2D视频合成流程：先生成MoMap，然后根据其扭曲图像并完成基于点的渲染。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro是一个处理纵向多模态医疗数据的框架，通过区域感知解耦和多时间尺度对齐，解决CXR序列冗余和与EHR数据时间不对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多模态数据（如EHR和连续CXR）对疾病进展建模至关重要，但面临两个挑战：连续CXR序列中的冗余（静态解剖区域主导临床有意义的变化）以及稀疏、不规则成像与连续EHR数据之间的时间不对齐。

Method: 首先，在连续CXR中解耦静态（解剖结构）和动态（病理进展）特征，优先考虑疾病相关变化。其次，通过局部（成对间隔级别）和全局（全序列）同步，将这些静态和动态CXR特征与异步EHR数据进行层次对齐。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的广泛实验表明，DiPro能有效提取时间临床动态，并在疾病进展识别和一般ICU预测任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DiPro框架通过解耦和对齐策略，成功解决了多模态医疗数据中的关键挑战，为疾病进展建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 提出SynTrans框架，通过从大型多模态模型转移多样化知识来增强现成的少样本学习器，显著提升少样本分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统少样本学习方法在利用语义知识时容易引入噪声和偏见，需要更有效的方法从大型多模态模型中转移互补知识

Method: 使用CLIP作为教师模型，通过无监督代理任务蒸馏语义对齐的视觉知识；训练免费的协同知识挖掘模块促进多模态模型协作；视觉-语义桥接模块实现双向知识转移；视觉权重生成器和语义权重重构器构建最优多模态分类器

Result: 在四个少样本学习数据集上的实验表明，即使搭配简单的少样本视觉编码器，SynTrans也显著优于当前最先进方法

Conclusion: SynTrans框架通过协同知识转移有效解决了少样本学习中的数据稀缺问题，为利用大型多模态模型提升少样本学习性能提供了新思路

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Yaqi Zhao,Xiaochen Wang,Li Dong,Wentao Zhang,Yuhui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中难以准确计数，研究发现仅扩大模型和数据规模无法解决此问题，提出通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法显著提升计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型是否能够通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确遵循文本提示中的计数指令，因为现有模型在计数方面表现不佳。

Method: 构建了两个合成计数基准数据集（GrayCount250和NaturalCount6），实证分析缩放假设，并提出通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法来控制数量。

Result: 缩放假设不成立：更大的模型和数据集无法改善计数准确性。提出的方法在GrayCount250上准确率从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6上从74.8%提升到86.3%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型主要依赖噪声初始化而非文本提示中的明确计数信息，噪声先验存在特定对象计数的偏差，通过注入计数感知布局信息可有效控制数量并实现跨设置的泛化。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了video-SALMONN S，首个能在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1FPS、360p）的流式音频-视觉LLM，通过测试时训练内存模块和提示相关内存读取器实现长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展处理长视频流，离线方法需要调整帧率，流式方法会丢失信息。需要开发能连续处理长视频且不丢失信息的解决方案。

Method: 引入测试时训练(TTT)内存模块持续更新token表示以捕获长程依赖，替换token合并；使用提示相关内存读取器从固定大小内存中选择性检索相关内容；采用Hessian-free共轭梯度优化TTT模块。

Result: 在长视频基准测试(Video-MME、LVBench、VideoEvalPro)上，能维持高质量理解，处理多达10k帧和1M token的多小时视频。8B参数模型在Video-MME长分割上达到74.2%总体和67.8%的准确率，优于离线和流式基线。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S是首个能在固定内存预算下处理超长视频的流式音频-视觉LLM，通过创新的内存管理机制解决了长视频处理的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

Motivation: 传统精液分析无法评估精子DNA碎片化这一关键男性生育参数，需要开发非破坏性的实时检测方法用于生殖医学临床诊断和治疗应用。

Method: 提出形态学辅助集成AI模型，结合图像处理技术和基于transformer的机器学习模型(GC-ViT)，通过相位对比图像预测精子DNA碎片化，并与纯视觉transformer模型和仅形态学模型进行基准测试。

Result: 所提出的框架能够达到60%的灵敏度和75%的特异性，显示出有前景的结果。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了生殖医学的重要进展，能够基于DNA完整性实现实时精子选择，适用于临床诊断和治疗应用。

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多流形证据融合网络(MMEFnet)，用于有效融合PolSAR协方差矩阵和多特征这两个互补视图，通过流形学习和证据理论实现更可靠、可解释的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统融合方法忽略了协方差矩阵和多特征位于不同流形上的几何结构差异，且未考虑不同视图的重要性差异和不确定性，导致预测不可靠。

Method: 将协方差矩阵建模在HPD流形上，多特征建模在Grassmann流形上，构建两个不同的核度量学习网络学习流形表示，然后使用可信多视图证据融合估计置信质量并量化不确定性，最后基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMEFnet成功将PolSAR流形学习和证据融合集成到统一架构中，实现了更可靠和可解释的多视图分类。

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

TL;DR: CoPRS是一个基于多模态思维链的位置感知模型，通过可微分的热图将语言推理连接到分割任务，提高了解释性和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器或表示文本位置，限制了可解释性和语义细节。

Method: 使用可学习集中令牌聚合图像和推理文本特征生成位置先验热图，通过轻量级解码器解码为精确掩码。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上达到或超过现有最佳性能，验证了热图质量与掩码质量之间的强关联。

Conclusion: 该范式成功连接了推理和分割，在推理驱动的集中性和掩码预测精度方面显示出优势。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO是一个新颖的跨模态对齐框架，通过抑制嵌入交互中的风格干扰，专注于语义信息对齐，显著提升了跨模态任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了风格等非语义信息的影响，导致信息偏差或丢失。需要分离语义和风格信息以实现更准确的对齐。

Method: 提出PICO框架，量化每个特征列表示语义信息的概率，并将其作为嵌入交互的权重。采用基于性能反馈的原型迭代构建方法来确保语义概率的可靠性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型骨干上的广泛实验表明，PICO优于现有最先进方法，性能提升达到5.2%-14.1%。

Conclusion: PICO通过有效抑制风格干扰，专注于语义信息对齐，显著提升了跨模态对齐任务的性能，证明了分离语义和风格信息的重要性。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 千亿级病理基础模型虽然性能优越，但计算成本巨大，难以实际应用。需要找到一种参数和数据高效的方法来获得类似性能。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，仅需目标癌症的1000张病理切片，将千亿级教师模型的能力迁移到大规模学生模型上。

Result: 蒸馏后的大规模模型不仅超越了同规模的最先进模型，在某些基准测试中甚至超过了千亿级教师模型和更大规模的模型，且具有更高的鲁棒性指数。

Conclusion: 该蒸馏方法是一种参数和数据高效的方式，可以在不产生过高计算负担的情况下，为癌症特定应用实现千亿级模型的性能水平。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在日常文化知识方面的鲁棒性，涵盖语言改写和视觉模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在全球部署，评估其对文化情境知识的理解能力变得至关重要。现有评估主要关注静态回忆或孤立视觉基础，未能回答VLMs是否具有稳健和可转移的文化理解能力。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集构建313个文化基础问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种对齐的多选题格式：文本基线、反转文本变体和VQA风格版本，包含4,916张图像和21,000多个多选题实例。

Result: BLEnD-Vis揭示了当前VLM文化知识的显著脆弱性；模型在语言改写下表现下降，虽然视觉线索通常有助于性能，但低跨模态一致性突显了在稳健整合文本和视觉理解方面的挑战，特别是对于资源较少的地区。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，暴露了局限性并指导开发更具文化能力的VLMs。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: 本文提出FlexAC框架，通过调节多模态大语言模型的联想推理强度，在忠实性和创造性之间实现灵活平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏调节联想推理强度的灵活性，限制了MLLMs在事实性和创造性场景中的适应性。

Method: FlexAC框架通过诱导幻觉引导的中间表示来编码联想方向，构建有效的联想引导向量，并自适应校准其强度以平衡创造性引导和输出稳定性。

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升高达5.8倍，在CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%，超越了现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexAC能够有效实现对MLLMs联想推理的灵活控制，在保持输出稳定性的同时显著提升创造性表现。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着儿童早期在线媒体消费的增长，需要数据驱动的工具来帮助教育工作者筛选适合年轻学习者的教育内容。

Method: 采用基于类别原型的监督对比学习方法，为每个类别学习原型，最小化类别原型与同类样本的距离，最大化与其他类别样本的距离。使用多模态transformer网络捕捉视觉和音频线索的交互。

Result: 在APPROVE数据集（193小时专家标注视频，19个类别）上，该方法优于YouTube-8M和COIN等基准方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效检测在线视频中的教育内容，为教育工作者提供筛选工具，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 该研究证明仅通过面部表情的动态成分就能识别个人身份，独立于静态面部外观。使用FLAME 3D模型分离面部形状和表情动态，在1,429人的对话视频数据集上达到61.14%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否能够仅通过面部表情的动态特征来识别个人身份，而不依赖静态面部外观特征。

Method: 使用FLAME 3D可变形模型分离面部形状和表情动态参数，仅保留表情和下颌系数。采用Conformer模型和监督对比学习进行1,429路分类。

Result: 在CANDOR数据集上达到61.14%的识别准确率，是随机猜测的458倍。引入漂移噪声比(DNR)量化形状-表情分离的可靠性。

Conclusion: 面部动态携带强烈的身份特征，不稳定的形状估计会损害动态识别性能。对话中的面部动态包含个体特异性签名。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

Conclusion: DTEA模型通过改进的跳跃连接框架有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

Conclusion: 基于LLM代理的自动化方法显著提高了SEM图像中尺度条检测和提取的效率和准确性，为科学图像分析提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

<details>

Motivation: 现有分类器编辑方法要么局限于错误修正，要么需要大量重训练成本，难以实现灵活编辑，特别是在图像分类领域研究有限。

Method: 引入Class Vectors，在潜在空间中解耦每个类别的适应过程，通过特征引导或权重空间映射来更新决策边界，利用向量的线性和正交性支持简单的类别算术操作。

Result: Class Vectors能有效捕捉类别的语义变化，在遗忘学习、环境适应、对抗防御和对抗触发优化等应用中表现出实用性。

Conclusion: Class Vectors为图像分类器提供了高效、灵活的概念编辑能力，克服了传统方法在编辑灵活性方面的限制。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

TL;DR: HaDola是一个人类不确定性感知的数据选择和自动标注框架，通过四阶段流程减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖，使视觉语言模型更准确且校准更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集存在人类不确定性（HU）——不同标注者置信度存在差异，但标准监督微调仅优化最频繁标签，忽略了HU分布。需要研究HU如何影响SFT训练以及如何有效利用HU。

Method: HaDola框架包含四个阶段：区分、自标注、错误触发和训练，通过迭代识别有害样本、优先选择信息丰富的样本，并从少量种子数据（5%）进行引导。

Result: 在VQAv2和VizWiz数据集上的广泛实验表明，HaDola使用更少的训练数据就能匹配或超越最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在监督微调中显式建模人类不确定性比单纯扩大数据集规模更有效，更好地利用HU比增加数据量更重要。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ΔEnergy的新型OOD检测分数，通过重新对齐视觉-语言模态来显著提升OOD检测性能，同时通过EBM方法改善协变量偏移下的OOD泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在真实下游任务中会同时遇到分布内数据和分布外数据，其中分布外数据包含协变量偏移和语义偏移。需要提升模型对协变量偏移OOD数据的泛化能力，同时有效检测开放集语义偏移OOD类别。

Method: 基于视觉-语言模态重新对齐时观察到的显著能量变化，提出ΔEnergy OOD分数。通过EBM（ΔEnergy下界最大化）方法同时提升OOD检测和泛化能力，并开发统一的微调框架。

Result: 在具有挑战性的OOD检测和泛化基准测试中表现出优越性，相比现有方法在AUROC指标上提升10%到25%。

Conclusion: ΔEnergy提供了一种更可靠的OOD检测方法，EBM方法理论证明不仅能增强OOD检测，还能产生领域一致的Hessian矩阵，作为OOD泛化的强指标。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署量、类别稳定性、预算限制和准确率要求，而非纯粹技术性能指标。零样本方法在低推理量和新类别场景下更具成本效益。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于草图的3D重建挑战，因为草图输入抽象稀疏，缺乏足够的语义和几何信息

Method: 引入语义桥接（草图到图像转换）来丰富稀疏草图表示，并加入对称约束作为几何先验来利用日常物体的结构规律性

Result: 在主流草图数据集上，该方法在Chamfer距离、Earth Mover距离和F-Score方面优于现有草图重建方法

Conclusion: 验证了所提出的语义桥接和对称感知设计的有效性

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

Method: 使用SAR影像，评估多种预处理（特别是斑点噪声抑制）、洪水制图和水深估计方法，通过集成预处理图像、洪水图和水深场来研究方法和超参数选择的影响。

imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SVG建模面临的三个挑战：数据集碎片化、方法跨任务可迁移性差、处理结构复杂性困难。

Method: 使用SVG特定特殊标记、基于子词的嵌入初始化和两阶段训练策略，从短静态SVG逐步过渡到长序列插图和复杂动画。

Result: 在SArena和现有基准测试中，InternSVG实现了显著性能提升，持续优于领先的开源和专有模型。

Conclusion: 统一建模方法能够促进正向迁移并提高整体性能，为SVG任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MMAP框架，通过多放大倍率表示和原型增强架构，同时解决空间转录组学中从H&E图像预测基因表达的两个关键挑战：局部特征粒度不足和全局空间上下文覆盖不充分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从H&E染色全切片图像预测空间基因表达存在显著模态差距，现有方法在局部特征提取粒度和全局空间上下文覆盖方面存在不足。

Method: MMAP框架采用多放大倍率表示增强局部特征粒度，学习潜在原型嵌入作为紧凑的切片级信息表示来改善全局上下文理解。

Result: 在多个评估指标（MAE、MSE、PCC）上，MMAP始终优于所有现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMAP通过同时解决局部特征粒度和全局上下文覆盖问题，显著提升了从组织学图像预测空间基因表达的性能。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在ControlNet中引入不确定性控制的方法，利用未标注域数据训练控制扩散模型，生成目标域的高质量标注数据，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet倾向于复制原始训练分布，限制了数据增强效果。需要利用未标注域数据来扩展模型能力，特别是在存在大域偏移的场景中（如不同OCT设备）。

Method: 在控制机制中引入不确定性概念，结合来自未标注数据集的不确定性控制和来自标注数据集的语义控制，训练能够生成目标域高不确定性标注数据的ControlNet。

Result: 在视网膜OCT实验中，该方法显著提升了Home-OCT设备数据的分割性能，无需额外监督。在交通场景实验中也验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导的方法能够实现任意域偏移而无需严格学习图像风格，为跨域数据增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Conclusion: 通过直接对齐图像与RL学习到的可泛化文本表示，可以消除对推理过程的依赖，在保持泛化性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为IQA模型的实用部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

Method: 强制2D高斯在延迟着色时生成多视角一致的材质图；通过跟踪多视角光度变化识别高反射区域；引入基于2DGS光线追踪的环境建模策略处理间接光照。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，该方法能忠实恢复光照和几何，在新视角合成中达到最先进的渲染质量。

Conclusion: 多视角一致材质推断与物理环境建模是高斯泼溅中学习准确反射的关键，能有效提升渲染质量。

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理工作流主要关注文本质量，忽略了视觉结构和样式对文档可读性和参与度的重要性。缺乏合适的奖励模型来指导生成具有更好结构和样式的文档。

Method: 构建了包含117K对文档的多领域数据集DocPair，涵盖32个领域和267种文档类型。使用Bradley-Terry损失训练DocReward模型，以文本质量无关的方式评估文档的专业性。

Result: DocReward在准确性上分别比GPT-4o和GPT-5高出30.6和19.4个百分点。在文档生成的外在评估中，DocReward的胜率达到60.8%，显著高于GPT-5的37.7%。

Conclusion: DocReward在评估文档结构和风格质量方面表现出色，能够有效指导生成代理产生更受人类偏好的文档，填补了现有代理工作流在视觉质量评估方面的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 解决内河水域海事态势感知中合作系统的脆弱性问题，通过结合非合作卫星图像来弥补AIS监控的局限性。

Method: 使用YOLO v11目标检测模型检测和表征船只，开发了包含4,550个实例的标注数据集，融合卫星图像和AIS轨迹数据。

Conclusion: 证明了非合作卫星传感与AIS融合的可行性，能够实现近实时船队盘点、异常检测和高质量内河水域监控数据生成。

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.

Conclusion: 通过视图对齐方法显著提升了3D高斯泼溅的几何表示能力，在保持高效渲染的同时实现了更准确的表面重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的表面法线积分方法，通过将问题重新定义为连续组件的相对尺度估计，大幅减少了优化变量数量，实现了比像素级方法快一个数量级的计算速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表面法线积分方法需要迭代全局优化来估计每个像素的深度，在处理大分辨率法线图时计算效率低下。

Method: 将法线积分重新定义为连续组件的相对尺度估计，包括准确估计连续组件的启发式方法、重新平衡优化项的策略以及迭代合并组件以进一步减小问题规模的技术。

Result: 在标准法线积分基准测试中达到最先进结果，仅需几秒钟，在大分辨率法线图上比像素级方法快一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法通过组件级优化显著提高了表面法线积分的计算效率，同时保持了重建质量。

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

*Ruiping Liu,Junwei Zheng,Yufan Chen,Zirui Wang,Kunyu Peng,Kailun Yang,Jiaming Zhang,Marc Pollefeys,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Situat3DChange是一个大规模3D数据集，支持三种情境感知变化理解任务，包含121K问答对、36K变化描述和17K重排指令。通过11K人类观察构建共享心智模型，提出SCReasoner方法进行高效点云比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D数据集和评估基准主要关注动态场景或动态情境的孤立方面，导致理解不完整。需要克服这些限制，建立更全面的动态环境理解能力。

Method: 利用11K人类观察构建数据集，整合自我中心和他者中心视角以及分类和坐标空间关系。提出SCReasoner方法，这是一种高效的3D多模态大语言模型方法，能够有效比较点云对，参数开销最小且无需语言解码器的额外标记。

Result: 在Situat3DChange任务上的全面评估突显了MLLMs在动态场景和情境理解方面的进展和局限性。数据缩放和跨域转移实验表明Situat3DChange作为训练数据集对MLLMs具有任务无关的有效性。

Conclusion: Situat3DChange数据集和SCReasoner方法为动态3D环境理解提供了重要进展，支持人机协作中的共享情境意识，并在多模态语言模型训练中展现出广泛适用性。

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LikePhys是一种无需训练的评估方法，通过区分物理有效和无效视频来评估视频扩散模型的直观物理理解能力，使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以在生成过程中将物理正确性与视觉外观分离，准确评估视频扩散模型的直观物理理解能力具有挑战性，这对构建通用物理合理世界模拟器至关重要。

Method: 使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代指标，在精心策划的有效-无效视频对数据集上区分物理有效和不可能的视频。

Result: 在涵盖四个物理领域的十二个场景基准测试中，提出的评估指标PPE与人类偏好高度一致，优于现有最佳评估基线。

Conclusion: 尽管当前模型在处理复杂混沌动力学方面仍有困难，但随着模型容量和推理设置的扩展，物理理解能力呈现明显改善趋势。

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmWalk是一个用于盲人和低视力人群户外安全导航的多模态模拟数据集，包含12万手动控制的行走轨迹和62K同步帧，涵盖RGB、深度和语义模态的55.9万张全景图像。还生成了包含6.9万个视觉问答对的基准测试mmWalkVQA，用于评估视觉语言模型在风险评估和导航任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲人和低视力人群在极端或复杂环境中行走辅助的挑战，由于缺乏整体场景理解，需要开发能够提供全面环境感知的导航系统。

Method: 构建mmWalk多模态数据集，包含多视角传感器和面向无障碍的特征；生成mmWalkVQA视觉问答基准测试；评估现有视觉语言模型的零样本和少样本性能；对模型进行微调并在真实世界数据集上验证。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在风险评估和导航任务上表现不佳；经过mmWalk微调的模型在真实世界数据集上显示出有效性，证明该数据集对推进多模态行走辅助具有价值。

Conclusion: mmWalk数据集能够有效提升多模态行走辅助系统的性能，特别是在处理户外复杂场景和无障碍导航方面，为盲人和低视力人群提供更好的行走支持。

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了DiT模型中的大规模激活现象，发现它们对局部细节合成至关重要，并提出了一种无需训练的自引导策略DG来增强细节保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型中存在大规模激活现象，但其功能尚未被充分理解，需要系统研究这些激活在视觉生成中的作用。

Method: 提出Detail Guidance (DG)策略，通过破坏大规模激活构建降质模型，并利用其引导原始网络进行更高质量的细节合成，可与CFG无缝集成。

Result: DG在各种预训练DiT模型（如SD3、SD3.5、Flux）上都能一致提升细粒度细节质量。

Conclusion: 大规模激活在局部细节合成中起关键作用，DG策略能有效增强DiT模型的细节保真度，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ODI-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型对全景图像的理解能力，并开发了Omni-CoT方法通过思维链推理提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在传统2D图像理解上表现出色，但对全景图像这种沉浸式环境的理解能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含2000张全景图像和4000个标注问答对的ODI-Bench基准，并提出Omni-CoT训练免费方法，通过文本和视觉线索的思维链推理来增强模型理解能力。

Result: 对20个代表性MLLM的测试表明，现有模型在全景图像理解上仍存在困难，而Omni-CoT方法能显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 全景图像理解是一个具有挑战性的任务，需要专门的方法来应对其独特的沉浸式特性，Omni-CoT为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

TL;DR: 通过幂律拟合预测达到特定ROC-AUC阈值所需的训练样本量，发现XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP相比ResNet-50基线能用更少标注样本达到强性能，仅需50个标注病例就能准确预测最终性能平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光分类至关重要但资源密集，通常需要大量标注数据。基础模型减轻了这种依赖，但所需标注样本数量仍不明确。

Method: 系统评估使用幂律拟合来预测达到特定ROC-AUC阈值所需的训练样本量，测试多种病理和基础模型。

Result: XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP相比ResNet-50基线能用显著更少的标注样本达到强性能，仅50个标注病例的学习曲线斜率就能准确预测最终性能平台。

Conclusion: 研究结果使从业者能够通过仅标注达到目标性能所需的基本样本来最小化标注成本。

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNAP是一个统一的交互式3D点云分割模型，支持点提示和文本提示，在室内、室外和航空等多种领域具有跨域泛化能力，在零样本基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前交互式3D分割方法局限于单一领域和单一交互方式的问题，避免多数据集训练导致的负迁移，实现跨域通用性。

Method: 在7个跨领域数据集上训练，采用域自适应归一化防止负迁移；对于文本提示分割，自动生成掩码提案并与CLIP文本查询嵌入匹配，支持全景和开放词汇分割。

Result: 在9个零样本空间提示基准测试中，8个达到最先进性能；在5个文本提示基准测试中均取得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 统一模型可以匹配或超越专门的领域特定方法，为可扩展的3D标注提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

Conclusion: 这些结果为高光谱作物制图的基础模型提供了系统评估，并指明了未来模型开发的方向，强调了模型架构对于跨地理区域和传感器平台强泛化能力的重要性。

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational
hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

TL;DR: MS-Mix是一个针对多模态情感分析的自适应、情感敏感的增强框架，通过情感感知样本选择、情感强度引导模块和情感对齐损失来解决传统Mixup在多模态场景中的标签模糊和语义不一致问题。


<details>

Result: 在三个基准数据集和六个最先进骨干网络上的广泛实验表明，MS-Mix持续优于现有方法，为鲁棒的多模态情感增强建立了新标准。

Conclusion: MS-Mix通过情感敏感的混合机制有效解决了多模态情感分析中的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归方法在训练视图和查询图像成像条件差异较大时泛化能力不足，因为其训练目标是在回归器权重中编码训练视图，本质上过拟合训练数据

Method: 将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，在数万个场景上预训练变换器，使其能够从映射图像泛化到未见过的查询图像

Result: 在多个挑战性重定位数据集上证明ACE-G方法显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了较低的计算开销

Conclusion: 通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示，并在大规模场景上预训练，可以有效提升视觉重定位方法的泛化能力

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

TL;DR: ExpVid是首个专门评估多模态大语言模型在科学实验视频理解能力的基准，通过三级任务层次（细粒度感知、程序理解、科学推理）系统测试模型性能，发现现有模型在细节区分、状态跟踪和科学推理方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽略了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长时程特性，无法准确评估MLLMs在科学实验视频理解方面的真实能力，需要开发更贴近实际科研场景的评估工具。

Method: 从同行评审视频出版物中构建ExpVid基准，采用三级任务层次结构，结合自动化生成和多学科专家验证的视觉中心标注流程，确保任务需要视觉基础。

Result: 评估了19个领先MLLMs，发现它们在粗粒度识别方面表现良好，但在细粒度细节区分、状态变化跟踪以及实验程序与科学结论关联方面表现不佳，专有模型与开源模型在高级推理方面存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了诊断工具，还为开发能够成为科学实验可信赖伙伴的MLLMs指明了发展路线图，揭示了当前模型在科学实验理解方面的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

TL;DR: LLF-LUT++是一个金字塔网络，通过拉普拉斯金字塔分解和重建整合全局和局部算子，在保持高性能的同时实现高分辨率图像的快速处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有照片增强方法要么注重性能但无法在边缘设备部署，要么注重计算效率但性能不足。需要一种既能快速处理高分辨率图像又能达到优异性能的方法。

Method: 使用图像自适应的3D LUT利用下采样图像的全局色调特征，结合两种权重融合策略实现粗略全局增强；设计空间频率变换器权重预测器提取权重；应用局部拉普拉斯滤波器自适应优化高频分量边缘细节。

Result: 在HDR+数据集上PSNR提升2.64 dB，4K分辨率图像在单GPU上仅需13毫秒处理时间，在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++通过精心设计的网络结构和变换器模型，成功实现了高性能和高效率的平衡，为照片增强提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

*Krittin Chaowakarn,Paramin Sangwongngam,Nang Htet Htet Aung,Chalie Charoenlarpnopparut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NV3D模型，通过从体素邻居获取局部特征（使用KNN和PCA计算法向量），结合两种采样策略可消除55%数据并保持性能，在KITTI数据集上显著提升了汽车和自行车检测的mAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法存在特征对齐困难或局部特征提取过于简化的问题，需要更有效的特征表示方法来处理复杂3D检测任务。

Method: 使用KNN和PCA计算体素法向量作为局部特征，提出法向量密度采样和FOV感知分箱采样两种策略，并应用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI验证集上，无采样的NV3D在汽车和自行车检测上分别达到86.60%和80.18% mAP，比基线Voxel R-CNN分别提升2.61%和4.23%；使用采样后仍能保持85.54% mAP，同时过滤掉约55%的体素。

Conclusion: NV3D通过法向量特征和高效采样策略，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算量，特别适用于具有空间形状的目标检测。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

*Pradyumna Yalandur Muralidhar,Yuxuan Xue,Xianghui Xie,Margaret Kostyrko,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhySIC是一个从单张RGB图像重建物理合理的人体-场景交互和接触的框架，能够恢复度量一致的SMPL-X人体网格、密集场景表面和顶点级接触图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理深度模糊、遮挡和物理不一致接触方面存在困难，需要从单张图像重建度量准确的人类及其周围场景，这对虚拟现实、机器人和全面3D场景理解至关重要。

Method: 从粗略的单目深度和人体估计开始，执行遮挡感知修复，融合可见深度与未缩放几何以构建稳健度量支架，合成缺失支撑表面，并通过置信度加权优化联合执行深度对齐、接触先验、互穿避免和2D重投影一致性。

Conclusion: PhySIC通过将单张图像转换为物理合理的3D人体-场景对，推进了可扩展的3D场景理解。

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

TL;DR: 提出了FACE框架，通过KL散度正则化增强非负矩阵分解，确保模型原始预测与基于概念的预测之间的一致性，从而提高概念解释的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动概念发现方法往往无法将提取的概念与模型真实决策过程对齐，损害了解释的忠实度。

Method: FACE框架在非负矩阵分解基础上加入KL散度正则化项，在概念学习过程中融入分类器监督，强制预测一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO和CelebA数据集上的系统评估表明，FACE在忠实度和稀疏性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACE通过理论保证和实验验证，能够提供更忠实的概念解释，促进学习概念空间中的局部线性性。

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Conclusion: 为机器人和具身AI中的开放集6D理解建立了新标准，展示了仅使用合成数据训练的框架在真实世界中的强大泛化性能。

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

*Boyang Zheng,Nanye Ma,Shengbang Tong,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出用表示自编码器(RAE)替代传统VAE作为扩散变换器(DiT)的潜在空间编码器，解决了VAE的局限性，实现了更好的生成质量和更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DiT使用的VAE编码器存在多个问题：过时的骨干网络、低维潜在空间限制信息容量、纯重建训练导致的弱表示，这些都限制了生成质量。

Method: 使用预训练的表示编码器(如DINO、SigLIP、MAE)配合训练的解码器构建RAE，分析高维潜在空间的挑战并提出理论解决方案，使用轻量级DDT头优化DiT。

Result: 在ImageNet上取得优异结果：256x256无引导FID 1.51，256x256和512x512有引导FID 1.13，收敛更快且无需辅助表示对齐损失。

Conclusion: RAE具有明显优势，应该成为扩散变换器训练的新标准配置。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

Conclusion: 这种新型混合方法在图像分类中具有更高效和鲁棒的潜力。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

TL;DR: DiT360是一个基于DiT的全景图像生成框架，通过混合训练视角和全景数据来解决全景图像生成中的几何保真度和真实感问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全景图像生成面临几何保真度和真实感不足的问题，主要原因是缺乏大规模高质量的真实世界全景数据，这与之前专注于模型设计的方法不同。

Method: 采用跨域转换和域内增强的关键模块，在VAE前图像级别通过视角图像引导和全景细化引入跨域知识，在VAE后token级别应用混合监督，包括循环填充、偏航损失和立方体损失。

Result: 在文本到全景、修复和外延任务上的大量实验表明，该方法在11个定量指标上实现了更好的边界一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据中心的视角和混合训练策略，有效提升了全景图像生成的几何保真度和真实感。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DiT360.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跟踪器和视频生成器解决密切相关的问题：前者分析运动，后者合成运动。这种联系使得预训练视频扩散模型能够执行零样本点跟踪。

Method: 在查询点放置独特颜色的标记，然后从中等噪声水平重新生成视频的其余部分，使标记在帧间传播。使用未编辑的初始帧作为负提示，确保标记在反事实生成中保持可见。

Result: 这种"涌现"跟踪方法优于先前的零样本方法，能够持续通过遮挡，性能与专门的自监督模型相当。

Conclusion: 预训练视频扩散模型可以通过简单的视觉提示实现有效的零样本点跟踪，展示了生成模型在分析任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Conclusion: Ev4DGS证明了仅使用事件流进行非刚性变形物体新视角渲染的可行性，为事件相机在动态场景渲染中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model

### [222] [CLoD-GS: Continuous Level-of-Detail via 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09997)
*Zhigang Cheng,Mingchao Sun,Yu Liu,Zengye Ge,Luyang Tang,Mu Xu,Yangyan Li,Peng Pan*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了CLoD-GS框架，将连续细节层次(LoD)机制集成到3D高斯泼溅表示中，通过可学习的距离相关衰减参数实现平滑的质量缩放，解决了传统离散LoD方法的存储开销和视觉伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散LoD方法需要存储多个模型副本且会产生视觉"弹出"伪影，而新兴的3D高斯泼溅技术的显式基元特性为实现连续LoD提供了理想基础。

Method: 为每个高斯基元引入可学习的距离相关衰减参数，动态调整其不透明度；采用虚拟距离缩放机制和从粗到细的训练策略，结合渲染点数量正则化。

Result: CLoD-GS从单一模型实现了平滑、质量可扩展的渲染，在广泛的性能目标下提供高保真结果，同时减少了基元数量和内存占用。

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了离散方法的存储开销和视觉伪影，证明了连续LoD在3D高斯泼溅中的可行性和优势。

Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer
graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving
visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels
(DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at
different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two
major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and
causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the
user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the
emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm:
Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality
scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems
of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a
continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method
introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian
primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity.
This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant
primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one
model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a
virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy
with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the
storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the
primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a
single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of
performance targets.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了共维模拟中的接触锁定限制，为真实世界织物的高分辨率模拟提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In this work we analyze and address a fundamental restriction that blocks the
reliable application of codimensional yarn-level and shell models with
thickness, to simulate real-world woven and knit fabrics. As discretizations
refine toward practical and accurate physical modeling, such models can
generate non-physical contact forces with stencil-neighboring elements in the
simulation mesh, leading to severe locking artifacts. While not well-documented
in the literature, this restriction has so far been addressed with two
alternatives with undesirable tradeoffs. One option is to restrict the mesh to
coarse resolutions, however, this eliminates the possibility of accurate (and
consistent) resolution simulations across real-world material variations. A
second alternative instead seeks to cull contact pairs that can create such
locking forces in the first place. This relaxes resolution restrictions but
compromise robustness. Culling can and will generate unacceptable and
unpredictable geometric intersections and tunneling that destroys weaving and
knitting structures and cause unrecoverable pull-throughs. We address these
challenges to simulating real-world materials with a new and practical
contact-processing model for thickened codimensional simulation, that removes
resolution restrictions, while guaranteeing contact-locking-free,
non-intersecting simulations. We demonstrate the application of our model
across a wide range of previously unavailable simulation scenarios, with
real-world material yarn and fabric parameters and patterns, challenging
simulation conditions and mesh resolutions, and both rod and shell models,
integrated with the IPC barrier.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GraphTracer是一个通过信息流分析重新定义失败归因的框架，它构建信息依赖图来显式捕捉代理如何参考和构建先前输出，通过依赖结构而非时间序列来定位根本原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在复杂任务中表现出色，但在多轮深度搜索场景中失败率很高。现有的时间归因方法难以准确诊断根本原因，特别是在错误跨多个代理传播时。现有方法无法考虑跨越代理的信息依赖关系。

Method: GraphTracer构建信息依赖图来显式捕捉代理如何参考和构建先前输出，通过依赖结构而非时间序列来定位根本原因。它还使用图感知的合成数据生成来针对关键节点，创建真实的失败场景。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试和生产系统集成中的评估表明，GraphTracer-8B相比最先进模型实现了高达18.18%的归因准确率提升，并在部署的多智能体框架中实现了4.8%到14.2%的性能改进。

Conclusion: GraphTracer为多智能体系统调试提供了一个强大的解决方案，通过信息流分析有效解决了多代理错误传播中的根本原因诊断问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models excel at complex tasks
through coordinated collaboration, yet they face high failure rates in
multi-turn deep search scenarios. Existing temporal attribution methods
struggle to accurately diagnose root causes, particularly when errors propagate
across multiple agents. Attempts to automate failure attribution by analyzing
action sequences remain ineffective due to their inability to account for
information dependencies that span agents. This paper identifies two core
challenges: \textit{(i) distinguishing symptoms from root causes in multi-agent
error propagation}, and \textit{(ii) tracing information dependencies beyond
temporal order}. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GraphTracer}, a
framework that redefines failure attribution through information flow analysis.
GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly
capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root
causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on
temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation
to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios. Evaluations on
the Who\&When benchmark and integration into production systems demonstrate
that GraphTracer-8B achieves up to 18.18\% higher attribution accuracy compared
to state-of-the-art models and enables 4.8\% to 14.2\% performance improvements
in deployed multi-agent frameworks, establishing a robust solution for
multi-agent system debugging.

TL;DR: 提出了D3MAS框架，通过分层协调机制解决多智能体系统中的知识冗余问题，显著提高推理准确性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多智能体系统存在严重的知识冗余问题，智能体在检索和推理过程中重复工作，缺乏最小充分信息共享机制

Method: 提出D3MAS框架，包含任务分解、协作推理和分布式内存三个协调层次，通过结构化消息传递在统一异构图中的跨层对齐

Result: 在四个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，D3MAS将推理准确率提高8.7%至15.6%，平均减少知识冗余46%

Conclusion: D3MAS通过结构设计而非显式优化有效解决了多智能体协作中的知识冗余问题，证明了分层协调框架的有效性

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models exhibit strong
capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, these systems suffer
from substantial knowledge redundancy. Agents duplicate efforts in retrieval
and reasoning processes. This inefficiency stems from a deeper issue: current
architectures lack mechanisms to ensure agents share minimal sufficient
information at each operational stage. Empirical analysis reveals an average
knowledge duplication rate of 47.3\% across agent communications. We propose
D3MAS (Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute), a hierarchical coordination
framework addressing redundancy through structural design rather than explicit
optimization. The framework organizes collaboration across three coordinated
layers. Task decomposition filters irrelevant sub-problems early. Collaborative
reasoning captures complementary inference paths across agents. Distributed
memory provides access to non-redundant knowledge. These layers coordinate
through structured message passing in a unified heterogeneous graph. This
cross-layer alignment ensures information remains aligned with actual task
needs. Experiments on four challenging datasets show that D3MAS consistently
improves reasoning accuracy by 8.7\% to 15.6\% and reduces knowledge redundancy
by 46\% on average.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、在推理时使用的VLM引导自适应负提示方法，通过视觉语言模型分析生成过程中的中间输出，自适应地引导生成远离传统视觉概念，促进新颖和令人惊讶的输出产生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真场景，但在生成真正新颖内容方面仍有困难。现有增强生成创造性的方法要么依赖图像特征插值（限制在预定义类别内），要么需要耗时的嵌入优化或模型微调过程。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型分析生成过程的中间输出，自适应地引导生成远离传统视觉概念。该方法无需训练，在推理时工作，可无缝集成到现有扩散管道中。

Result: 通过CLIP嵌入空间的统计指标评估，在创造性新颖性方面取得了一致的提升，计算开销可忽略。该方法不仅适用于生成单个对象，还能扩展到复杂场景，如生成连贯的创意对象集和在复杂组合提示中保持创造性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用的途径来产生超越文本描述限制的创意输出，在保持生成对象有效性的同时促进了创造性图像生成。

Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples
that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to
extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist
in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image
diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match
user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing
approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of
image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or
require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model
fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a
training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation
while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a
vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the
generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual
concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We
evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical
metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show
consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead.
Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our
approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of
creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional
prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines,
offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond
the constraints of textual descriptions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的优化框架，用于计算同时保持中轴结构和确保高质量中轴网格的中轴变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中轴结构（由相互连接的片、接缝和交点组成）为3D形状提供了自然的体积分解，但现有方法难以同时保持结构完整性和网格质量。

Method: 采用基于受限功率图（RPD）的结构感知、基于粒子的优化流程，通过球形二次误差度量（SQEM）投影约束中轴球体移动，并使用高斯核能量促进均匀空间分布。

Result: 与MATFP和MATTopo等方法相比，该方法产生了更清晰、更准确的中轴结构，网格质量显著提高。

Conclusion: 这是首个将结构感知集成到优化过程中的框架，产生了具有卓越几何保真度、拓扑正确性和明确结构分解的中轴网格。

Abstract: We propose a novel optimization framework for computing the medial axis
transform that simultaneously preserves the medial structure and ensures high
medial mesh quality. The medial structure, consisting of interconnected sheets,
seams, and junctions, provides a natural volumetric decomposition of a 3D
shape. Our method introduces a structure-aware, particle-based optimization
pipeline guided by the restricted power diagram (RPD), which partitions the
input volume into convex cells whose dual encodes the connectivity of the
medial mesh. Structure-awareness is enforced through a spherical quadratic
error metric (SQEM) projection that constrains the movement of medial spheres,
while a Gaussian kernel energy encourages an even spatial distribution.
Compared to feature-preserving methods such as MATFP and MATTopo, our approach
produces cleaner and more accurate medial structures with significantly
improved mesh quality. In contrast to voxel-based, point-cloud-based, and
variational methods, our framework is the first to integrate structural
awareness into the optimization process, yielding medial meshes with superior
geometric fidelity, topological correctness, and explicit structural
decomposition.

Motivation: 传统野火数据可视化过于简化，缺乏对生态和社会复杂性的关注，需要一种更伦理、更关系化的方法来呈现野火作为共享时间条件的本质。

Method: 结合植物启发的数据形式、基于事件的映射和叙事分层，将野火数据重新构想为有纹理的、受伤的档案。

Result: 创建了一个体现野火作为生态和社会纠缠活档案的可视化框架，强调其具身性、关系性和伦理维度。

Abstract: The Fire We Share proposes a care-centered, consequence-aware visualization
framework for engaging with wildfire data not as static metrics, but as living
archives of ecological and social entanglement. By combining plants-inspired
data forms, event-based mapping, and narrative layering, the project
foregrounds fire as a shared temporal condition-one that cuts across natural
cycles and human systems. Rather than simplifying wildfire data into digestible
visuals, The Fire We Share reimagines it as a textured, wounded
archive-embodied, relational, and radically ethical.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何在表示空间中"思考"，理解其推理过程的内在机制，超越表面形式分析。

Method: 使用几何框架建模推理过程，将逻辑推理视为表示空间中的流，通过自然演绎命题分离逻辑结构和语义，分析位置、速度和曲率等几何量。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究推理现象提供了概念基础和实践工具，为LLM行为的可解释性和形式分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

Method: 开发PULSE评估框架，包含用户反馈收集、用户满意度预测模型训练、人工评分与模型伪标签结合的结果计算。在OpenHands开源软件代理平台上部署，收集超过15,000用户的使用数据。

Conclusion: 研究为人类与LLM代理的评估提供了指导，识别了改进代理设计的机会，强调了基准驱动评估的局限性。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

Motivation: 现有的地球观测驱动表示主要编码物理和光谱模式，缺乏对城市功能和社会经济维度的捕捉，需要结合人类活动信息。

Method: 通过多模态对齐将AlphaEarth嵌入与POI文本表示对齐，在预训练AE基础上进行轻量级语义增强。

Result: 在伦敦地区，AETHER相比AE基线在土地利用分类F1得分提升7.2%，社会经济映射的KL散度降低23.6%。

Conclusion: AETHER通过耦合地球观测与人类中心语义，推进地理空间基础模型向整合物理形态和功能意义的通用城市表示发展。

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their

hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for

Method: 通过评估15个大语言模型在人类验证的情感智力测试上的表现，使用相同的场景搭配不同的用户档案，分析情感解读的系统性差异。

Result: 研究发现相同场景搭配不同用户档案会产生系统性的情感解读差异，多个高性能LLM中存在系统性偏见，优势群体获得更准确的情感理解，且在情感理解和支持性建议任务中存在显著的人口统计因素差异。

Conclusion: 记忆增强型AI面临关键挑战：为个性化设计的系统可能无意中强化社会不平等，个性化机制可能将社会等级嵌入模型的情感推理中。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

*Olivia Peiyu Wang,Tashvi Bansal,Ryan Bai,Emily M. Chui,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本、基于指令的干预方法，通过分步指令数据集和知识图谱验证，显著提升LLM的逻辑谬误分类能力，同时增强决策透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM存在关键推理缺陷，包括幻觉倾向和逻辑谬误分类准确性差，这源于其默认的快速直觉式系统1处理，而可靠推理需要深思熟虑的系统2方法。

Method: 引入新颖的分步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为一系列原子程序步骤（简单二元问题），并通过咨询相关谬误的关系知识图谱进行最终验证。

Result: 这种基于程序的规则干预显著提高了LLM的逻辑谬误分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号架构解决LLM推理缺陷提供了一条实用途径，同时增强了决策透明度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

*Pratik S. Sachdeva,Tom van Nuenen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过多轮辩论实验发现，不同LLM在道德推理中表现出显著的行为差异，GPT强调个人自主性而Claude和Gemini更注重共情对话，且辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感日常场景中的部署增加，需要理解它们在复杂道德推理中的价值取向。现有研究多关注单轮提示，但多轮对话中价值通过对话、修订和共识形成的过程尚不清楚。

Method: 使用LLM辩论方法，让GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash三个模型在1000个Reddit日常道德困境中集体分配责任，采用同步和轮询两种辩论格式测试顺序效应和裁决修订。

Result: GPT表现出强惯性（0.6-3.1%修订率），Claude和Gemini更灵活（28-41%）。GPT强调个人自主性和直接沟通，Claude和Gemini优先考虑共情对话。辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响，GPT和Gemini表现出高度从众性。

Conclusion: 多轮互动中的道德推理受到辩论格式和模型特定行为的强烈影响，技术社会对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于对话结构方式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了RIPRAG攻击框架，这是一个针对检索增强生成(RAG)系统的黑盒中毒攻击方法，使用强化学习优化中毒文档生成，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要针对简化的RAG架构进行白盒攻击，而实际场景中攻击者通常不了解RAG系统的内部组成和实现细节，且RAG系统包含多个组件。

Method: 使用强化学习(RL)优化中毒文档生成模型，将目标RAG系统视为黑盒，仅利用攻击是否成功的信息来训练生成器。

Result: 该方法能有效攻击大多数复杂RAG系统，攻击成功率(ASR)相比基线方法提升高达0.72。

Conclusion: 当前防御方法存在普遍缺陷，为LLM安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Qinglin Zeng,Ningyuan Liu,Stephen Fan,Ziliang Chen,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CE-Graph框架，将LLM工作流优化重新定义为分布问题，通过最小化期望失败质量来系统性地学习失败分布的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM工作流优化方法存在信息坍缩问题，将丰富的多步骤执行轨迹简化为成功/失败信号，无法建模失败分布结构。

Method: 引入失败签名空间(FSS)概念，通过反例池近似失败分布，识别密集失败模式，使用提议-验证机制进行有向图编辑来贪婪减少失败质量。

Result: 在数学、代码和问答基准测试中，CE-Graph以显著更低的成本实现了更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统可靠性源于系统性地学习和重塑失败分布的几何结构，而非简单地避免失败。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

TL;DR: 提出图论框架分离可信度与置信度，定义推理区域作为高置信度平衡子图，支持局部经典推理，并引入冲击更新模型信念变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信念系统通常存在全局不一致性，但局部推理仍然有效，需要一种能够容忍矛盾并在结构支持的地方激活经典逻辑的推理框架。

Method: 构建有向带符号加权图表示信念关系，通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，定义推理区域并开发近线性算法构建区域图谱，引入冲击更新模型信念变化。

Result: 在合成带符号图上验证了区域恢复能力、冲击下的稳定性以及运行时间，为容忍矛盾的推理提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为容忍矛盾的推理提供了原则性基础，能够在结构支持的地方精确激活经典逻辑，实现局部有效推理。

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

TL;DR: SwarmSys是一个受群体智能启发的分布式多智能体推理框架，通过探索者、工作者和验证者三个角色的迭代交互实现协调，无需全局监督即可支持动态任务分配和自组织收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体框架依赖固定角色或集中控制，限制了长时程推理的可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 集成自适应智能体和事件档案、基于嵌入的概率匹配以及信息素启发的强化机制，支持动态任务分配和自组织收敛。

Result: 在符号推理、研究综合和科学编程任务中，SwarmSys始终优于基线方法，提高了准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 群体启发的协调是扩展、稳健和自适应多智能体推理的有前景范式，协调扩展可能与模型扩展在推进LLM智能方面相媲美。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE是一个自监督预训练框架，通过掩码视觉建模和跨模态对比对齐，从无标签音视频流中学习同步感知和可转移的面部动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以从无标签数据中学习同步感知的面部动态，并实现跨不同下游任务的统一建模。

Method: 结合掩码视觉建模与跨模态对比对齐，使用三个提示令牌分别编码身份、语音同步面部动态和音频无关运动，通过对比学习实现音视频同步。

Result: 在四个不同任务家族中达到最先进性能，包括音视频流同步、面部表情识别、视觉语音识别和视觉配音。

Conclusion: 同步感知、分解的自监督预训练方法有效，能够为多种下游任务提供统一的接口。

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: StepFly是一个端到端的自动化故障排除指南框架，通过三阶段工作流解决TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解析、数据密集型查询和并行执行等关键挑战，在真实TSG上达到约94%的成功率，显著减少执行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模IT系统中的故障管理依赖故障排除指南(TSG)，但手动执行缓慢且容易出错。现有基于LLM的解决方案缺乏对TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解析、数据密集型查询和并行执行等关键挑战的专业支持。

Method: StepFly采用三阶段工作流：1) TSG Mentor工具协助SRE改进TSG质量；2) 离线预处理使用LLM从非结构化TSG中提取结构化执行DAG并创建专用查询准备插件(QPPs)；3) 在线执行使用DAG引导的调度器-执行器框架，支持并行执行独立步骤。

Result: 在真实TSG和事件上的实证评估显示，StepFly在GPT-4.1上达到约94%的成功率，优于基线方法，且时间和token消耗更少。对于可并行化的TSG，执行时间减少了32.9%到70.4%。

Conclusion: StepFly通过其创新的三阶段框架有效解决了TSG自动化中的关键挑战，显著提高了故障排除的效率和成功率，为大规模IT系统的自动化事件管理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

TL;DR: 提出了DixitWorld评估套件，包含动态多代理环境DixitArena和静态QA基准DixitBench，用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态溯因推理能力，揭示了生成创造性和判别理解之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对视觉语言模型多模态溯因推理能力的评估主要局限于静态、单代理任务，缺乏对动态、多代理场景下假设生成和选择能力的全面评估。

Method: 开发DixitWorld评估套件：DixitArena评估讲故事者生成隐晦线索和听众从干扰项中选择目标图像的能力；DixitBench隔离听众任务进行高效控制评估。

Result: 较小开源模型作为讲故事者更具创造性但线索区分度较低，较大专有模型整体表现更优特别是在听众角色；DixitBench与DixitArena听众结果强相关。

Conclusion: 多模态溯因推理中存在生成创造性和判别理解的关键权衡，这是开发更平衡、更强大视觉语言代理的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

Motivation: 确保角色身份在不同提示下的连贯性是扩散式文本到图像生成的基本限制问题。

Method: 基于冻结的扩散骨干网络，使用可组合的LoRA适配器，通过提示感知控制在推理时动态组合适配器。

Result: 在多场景叙事实验中，CharCom显著提升了角色保真度、语义对齐和时间连贯性，在拥挤场景中保持鲁棒性，并能以最小开销实现可扩展的多角色生成。

Conclusion: 该框架非常适合故事插图和动画等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

TL;DR: 提出PALU方法，通过性能感知长度更新实现简洁推理，将推理长度减少65%同时提升准确率15%，并能跨领域和模型规模适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有简洁推理方法依赖手工设计的启发式规则，难以平衡简洁性和性能，且无法跨领域和模型规模适应。

Method: 将简洁推理建模为约束优化问题，应用拉格朗日优化，并通过三个近似简化更新规则：离策略性能估计、拉格朗日乘子截断、分位数驱动的长度调整。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上，平均减少输出长度65%，提升准确率15%，在五个基准测试中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: PALU是一种实用有效的简洁推理方法，能够跨领域和模型规模适应。

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

TL;DR: 提出了SAFER框架，通过两阶段风险控制解决开放域问答中LLM输出的可信度问题，包含弃权感知采样和一致性过滤，提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性一致性预测方法假设所有实例的可接受答案都能通过有限采样获得，这在开放域问答场景中不现实，因为缺乏固定有限的解空间。

Method: SAFER框架：1) 在验证集上使用Clopper-Pearson精确方法校准采样预算；2) 应用一致性风险控制方法确定统计有效的置信度阈值，过滤不可靠候选答案。

Result: SAFER能够控制正确答案被排除的风险，兼容各种任务特定的准入标准和验证-测试分割比例，具有鲁棒性和高数据效率。

Conclusion: SAFER为开放域问答中的LLM输出提供了统计可信度保证，解决了现有方法在无限解空间场景中的局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM智能体在复杂多轮工具使用任务中面临的高质量训练数据稀缺问题，以及SFT方法容易过拟合、标准RL方法存在冷启动和训练不稳定的挑战。

Method: Environment Tuning范式：1）结构化课程编排学习过程；2）可操作的环境增强提供纠正反馈；3）细粒度进度奖励确保稳定高效探索。

Result: 仅使用BFCL基准的400个问题实例，不仅达到有竞争力的分布内性能，还表现出优越的分布外泛化能力，克服了SFT方法的性能崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 从基于静态轨迹的监督微调转向基于环境的动态探索，为训练更鲁棒和数据高效的智能体开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

*Manjiang Yu,Hongji Li,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PIXEL是一个位置感知的激活引导框架，通过双视图学习属性对齐子空间，使用几何约束目标自适应选择干预强度，无需全局超参数调优，实现LLM的可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法依赖粗糙启发式，缺乏对引导位置和干预强度的原则性指导，需要更可靠的行为控制来部署LLM。

Method: 从双视图（尾平均和末端标记）学习属性对齐子空间，通过约束几何目标选择干预强度，进行样本级正交残差校准和轻量级位置扫描识别注入点。

Result: 在多样化模型和评估范式下，PIXEL持续改善属性对齐，同时保持模型通用能力。

Conclusion: PIXEL为LLM可控生成提供了实用且原则性的方法，具有可靠的表示级保证。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出自适应双推理器(ADR)，通过快速思维和慢速思维两种推理模式的动态切换，在保持推理性能的同时显著降低计算成本和推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长推理模型(LRMs)在推理过程中因过度思考导致的计算成本增加和推理延迟问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 使用监督微调构建混合推理数据集；2) 引入熵引导混合策略优化(EHPO)强化学习框架，包含熵引导动态展开策略和难度感知惩罚机制。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，性能提升最高达6.1%，同时推理输出长度减少49.5%至59.3%。

Conclusion: ADR在推理性能和效率之间实现了有效平衡，是当前最优方法之一。

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

Method: 提出基于扰动的关键神经元因果识别方法，系统定位LLMs中的关键神经元。

Result: 发现：(1) LLMs包含超稀疏关键神经元集，破坏这些神经元可使720亿参数模型完全崩溃，困惑度增加20个数量级；(2) 关键神经元非均匀分布，集中在外层特别是MLP down_proj组件；(3) 性能退化呈现急剧相变而非渐进下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更鲁棒的模型架构和提高安全关键应用中的部署安全性提供了指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

Motivation: 多模态大推理模型在视觉语言推理中仍存在幻觉问题，表现为错误的推理链和视觉内容误解，这阻碍了其在高风险应用中的安全部署。

Method: 提出功能性头识别和类条件重缩放的两步插件：首先定位感知导向和推理导向的注意力头，然后调节这些头的贡献，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 在三个真实世界MLRM模型、六个基准测试和四个基线方法上的评估显示，该方法平均提升5%，最高提升15%，仅增加<1%的计算开销和9%的基线延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法完全模型无关，显著提升了现有多模态大推理模型的可靠性和可解释性，使其能够在高风险应用中安全部署。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create

fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 虽然医疗AI公平性的伦理论证已很充分，但包容性设计的经济和战略价值仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，证明包容性创新能创造超越合规要求的商业价值。

Method: 借鉴辅助技术发展成主流产业的案例，识别包容性创新驱动回报的四个机制，并开发了医疗AI包容性创新框架(HAIIF)评分系统来评估AI投资。

Conclusion: 渐进投资包容性设计的组织能获得市场扩展和持续竞争优势，而将包容性视为成本的组织将面临网络效应和数据优势积累带来的复合劣势。

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

Motivation: 解决LLM幻觉问题并提高部署可靠性，需要有效的置信度估计方法。

Method: 通过多模型、多数据集和多提示的综合实验，分析推理轨迹长度作为置信度估计器的性能，并研究其机制。

Result: 轨迹长度与口头置信度等零样本置信度估计器表现相当但互补，推理后训练显著改变了轨迹长度与准确率的关系，高熵或"分叉"标记在机制中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 推理后训练增强了不确定性量化能力，轨迹长度是大型推理模型的实用置信度度量标准。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在建模患者轨迹方面具有通用性，但面临电子健康记录数据长且噪声多的问题，在时序推理方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用多代理系统，工作代理按顺序处理可管理的数据块，将关键事件提取到共享长期记忆模块EHRMem中，管理代理综合工作代理总结和EHRMem中的时间线进行预测。

Result: 在基于五年电子健康记录数据的零样本一年肺癌风险预测任务中，Traj-CoA优于四类基线方法。分析显示该方法展现出临床对齐的时序推理能力。

Conclusion: Traj-CoA是建模复杂患者轨迹的稳健且可推广的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

Conclusion: 协作式多智能体方法能够显著提升医疗AI在整合临床工作流中的性能，提供可解释的决策路径，为真实医疗场景提供更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical

Motivation: 推理模型通过增加计算资源提升性能，但识别哪些推理路径可能成功是关键机会，可靠预测有效路径可大幅减少浪费的计算并提高整体效率。

Method: 引入Latent-Trajectory信号，通过测量推理开始和结束时内部表征的总体变化、中间步骤累积的变化以及这些变化向最终状态的推进程度，来预测解决方案的准确性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了推理时效率的实用策略，还从可解释性角度深入理解了推理过程在潜在空间中的表示和区分方式。

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM对学术论文的深度理解方面存在不足，要么问题设计过于表面化，要么评估指标不可靠。

Method: 通过激励驱动的对抗性标注过程构建ELAIPBench基准，包含三个难度级别的多选题，强调非平凡推理而非浅层检索。

Result: 最佳性能的LLM准确率仅为39.95%，前沿LLM配备思考模式或RAG系统未能改善结果，甚至因过度思考或噪声检索而降低准确率。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与真正理解学术论文之间存在显著差距。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

Conclusion: 提出的基于累积Jaccard指数的距离度量方法在RPS理论中具有重要价值，其自然的上权重特性和可调参数为决策者提供了更好的灵活性。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用进化算法优化大语言模型的方法（EA4LLM），首次成功训练了10亿参数的LLM，挑战了基于梯度优化是训练神经网络唯一可行方法的普遍假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于梯度的优化器对硬件要求严格，需要高并发、高内存的GPU，且要求所有神经网络操作可微分，排除了许多有前景的不可微分架构。

Method: 使用进化算法来优化大语言模型，从预训练阶段开始训练模型。

Result: 成功训练了10亿参数的LLM，并通过大量实验提供了关于进化算法如何有效优化神经网络的关键见解。

Conclusion: 该方法有显著潜力降低训练大语言模型的计算成本，使计算资源有限的群体能够参与深度学习研究。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体强化学习框架，协调领域专业智能体进行多模态文本到图像生成，通过复合奖励函数平衡语义相似度、视觉质量和内容多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态文本到图像生成中语义对齐和专业细节保持的困难，特别是在跨不同视觉领域时。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习框架，包含文本增强和图像生成两个耦合子系统，采用PPO算法训练，结合对比学习、双向注意力和迭代反馈机制。

Result: 在六个实验设置中显著丰富生成内容（词数增加1614%），ROUGE-1分数降低69.7%；Transformer融合方法获得最高综合得分0.521；多模态集成方法一致性中等（0.444-0.481）。

Conclusion: 协作式、专业化驱动的架构在推进可靠多模态生成系统方面具有潜力，但跨模态语义基础仍面临持续挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

Motivation: 虽然学生学习满意度已被广泛研究，但可解释机器学习和神经网络等现代技术尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用结合了提升方法和可解释性的自动分段线性回归(APLR)模型，并与几种最先进方法进行比较。

Result: APLR模型提供了最佳拟合，通过数值和视觉解释发现时间管理、专注力、帮助同学和线下课程参与度是最重要的正面影响因素。

Conclusion: 影响因素可在个体层面解释，使教育者能够根据学生特征定制教学指导。

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型和数学优化的混合框架，用于在线叫车平台的供需平衡问题，无需训练数据，通过LLM作为元优化器生成语义启发式来指导底层优化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法的两大问题：强化学习方法数据效率低、对现实动态建模过于简化、难以强制执行操作约束；分解在线优化方法依赖手动设计的高层目标，缺乏对底层路由动态的感知。

Method: 提出动态分层系统：LLM作为元优化器生成语义启发式，底层优化器负责约束执行和实时决策，通过和谐搜索驱动的闭环进化过程迭代优化LLM提示。

Result: 基于纽约和芝加哥出租车数据集的实验表明，相比最先进基线方法平均提升16%的性能。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了在线叫车平台的供需平衡问题，结合了LLM的语义理解和数学优化的约束执行能力，实现了训练免费且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UCAS是一种模型无关的强化学习方法，通过利用模型内部不确定性信号来改进信用分配，解决了RLVR中粗粒度优势信号导致探索效率低和熵崩溃的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR算法（如GRPO）对所有token广播统一优势信号，忽略了推理过程中不确定的高风险决策的关键作用，导致探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。

Method: UCAS采用两阶段机制：首先根据模型的整体自信度调节响应级优势，然后基于原始logit确定性应用token级惩罚。这种双重机制鼓励探索产生正确答案的高不确定性路径，同时惩罚过度自信但错误的推理。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准上的广泛实验表明，UCAS在多个模型规模（包括1.5B和7B）上显著优于强RLVR基线，不仅获得更高奖励，还促进更大的推理多样性并成功缓解熵崩溃。

Conclusion: UCAS通过不确定性感知的优势塑造有效平衡了探索-利用权衡，显著提升了强化学习在语言模型推理能力增强方面的效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试无法全面评估音频和视觉模态之间的协同推理能力，往往忽视其中一个模态或以逻辑不一致的方式整合它们。

Method: 构建了包含1000个高质量问答对的基准测试，每个问答对都有逐步推理轨迹，来自628个多样化视频，涵盖13种精心设计的问题类型。

Result: 多个MLLM在OmniVideoBench上的评估显示，模型性能与人类推理之间存在显著差距，开源模型明显落后于闭源模型。

Conclusion: OmniVideoBench将公开发布，以促进开发具有更强、更通用推理能力的MLLM，突显了真正音视频推理的内在难度。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 传统推理演算基于二元归结，限制了多子句之间的推理协同作用。虽然2018年提出的CSE框架建立了动态多子句推理理论，但其算法实现尚未形式化。

Method: 开发了扩展三角方法(ETM)，在三角几何框架内统一多种矛盾构建策略，包括标准扩展方法，支持灵活的子句交互和动态协同。

Result: ETM作为多个高性能定理证明器(CSE、CSE-E、CSI-E、CSI-Enig)的核心算法，在标准一阶基准测试(TPTP问题集和CASC 2018-2015)中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: ETM通过连接理论抽象和操作实现，将矛盾分离范式推进为通用、可扩展且具有实际竞争力的自动推理模型，为逻辑推理和定理证明的未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将自然语言问题翻译为符号语言时，只关注语义相似度，忽视了不同符号语言类型本身对特定逻辑推理问题的适用性差异。

Method: 利用LLMs自适应选择最适合的符号语言（一阶逻辑、逻辑编程或布尔可满足性），然后将自然语言问题翻译为目标符号语言表达式，并使用相应的逻辑求解器得出最终答案。

Result: 在基准测试中，自适应选择方法显著优于单一符号语言翻译和随机选择方法。在混合数据集上达到96%准确率，比一阶逻辑翻译的次高准确率提升25%。

Conclusion: 不同自然语言逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法，自适应选择目标符号语言能显著提升LLMs的逻辑推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个框架来评估大型语言模型是否具备真正的战略思维能力，通过分析信念形成、行动评估和选择行为，发现在特定推理深度下前沿模型能表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为，并展现出元推理和新型启发式规则形成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在均衡策略或推理深度方面的表现，但对其是否具备真正的战略思维能力（包括信念形成、行动评估和基于信念的选择）仍缺乏探索。

Method: 开发了一个框架来在静态完全信息博弈中分离信念、评估和选择，通过分析模型的显性选择和推理轨迹，并引入新的无上下文博弈来排除记忆模仿的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在目标推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为；无约束时会自我限制推理深度，并对人类和合成对手形成差异化推测；在复杂性增加时，显式递归让位于内部生成的稳定、模型特定的启发式选择规则。

Conclusion: 信念一致性、元推理和新型启发式形成可以从语言建模目标中共同涌现，为研究人工代理的战略认知提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在数学自动形式化中难以识别和利用前提知识的挑战，传统检索方法因非正式陈述复杂且上下文有限而效果不佳

Method: 引入DRIFT框架，将非正式数学陈述分解为更易处理的子组件，从Mathlib等库中针对性检索前提，并获取示例定理辅助形式化

Result: 在多个基准测试中一致改进前提检索，ProofNet上F1分数相比DPR基线几乎翻倍，在ConNF基准上GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1分别提升37.14%和42.25%

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化中检索效果高度依赖模型特定知识边界，需要与模型能力对齐的自适应检索策略

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Motivation: 研究具身AI中出现的神经症行为模式，这些行为虽然内部逻辑一致但与现实环境不匹配，可能导致系统性能下降和安全风险。

Method: 在网格导航系统中识别多种神经症模式，开发轻量级在线检测器和可重用逃逸策略，并使用遗传编程进行破坏性测试，通过演化世界和扰动来最大化法律压力和神经症评分。

Result: 成功识别了12种神经症模式，开发了有效的检测和逃逸机制，并展示了即使在完全可见性下，习得的厌恶成本仍能导致持久的恐惧回避行为。

Conclusion: 局部修复不足以解决全局故障，需要通过破坏性测试暴露系统弱点，要求架构层面的修订而不仅仅是症状级别的修补。

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

*Daoyu Wang,Mingyue Cheng,Qi Liu,Shuo Yu,Zirui Liu,Ze Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PaperArena基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在跨论文推理和多工具协调方面的能力，发现当前最先进的代理系统仅达到38.78%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要局限于单篇论文内的无工具任务，缺乏真实研究场景中跨论文推理和多工具协调的基准测试。

Method: 构建了模块化可扩展的平台，提供多模态解析、上下文检索和程序化计算等工具，让代理通过推理和工具交互整合多篇论文信息来回答研究问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使最先进的LLM代理系统平均准确率仅为38.78%，在困难子集上更是降至18.47%，且所有测试代理都存在工具使用效率低下的问题。

Conclusion: PaperArena揭示了当前科学发现代理能力的显著不足，为开发更强大的科学发现代理提供了评估基准和发展方向。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

*SHengjie Ma,Chenlong Deng,Jiaxin Mao,Jiadeng Huang,Teng Wang,Junjie Wu,Changwang Zhang,Jun wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Proof-of-Use (PoU)框架来解决检索增强生成(RAG)代理中的工具调用黑客问题，通过证据基础的强化学习确保检索证据与最终答案之间的可验证因果联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现强化学习训练的RAG代理存在工具调用黑客失败模式，即代理通过发出表面正确的工具调用来夸大奖励信号，而不真正利用检索证据，导致模式崩溃和虚假基础。

Method: 提出Proof-of-Use (PoU)框架，通过统一的逐步合约结合语法引用验证、基于扰动的敏感性奖励和答案-证据对齐目标，确保工具使用既可解释又功能基础。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，PoU在事实准确性、证据忠实度和工具路由平衡方面持续优于DeepResearch基线，涵盖域内、域外和工具分布外设置。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在RL训练代理中不仅需要基于任务结果，还需要基于检索信息的因果使用进行基础化，为可信的检索增强推理提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化混合检索框架，通过知识图谱、深度图表示和语义搜索的集成，解决企业异构系统中复杂查询的检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于关键词搜索或静态嵌入的方法无法处理需要跨文档上下文推理和多跳推理的复杂查询，企业需要更智能的知识检索方案。

Method: 构建统一知识图谱，集成KBLam模型、DeepGraph表示和嵌入驱动的语义搜索，通过查询分析动态选择最优检索策略，支持结构化和非结构化数据源。

Result: 在大规模Git仓库上的实验表明，统一推理层相比独立GPT检索管道将答案相关性提高了80%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过图构建、混合推理和交互式可视化的结合，为企业环境提供了可扩展、可解释和以用户为中心的智能知识助手基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在语义理解方面表现出色，但在精确时空理解方面存在不足，特别是忽视了视频中的物理信息（如多对象布局和运动），这限制了在具身智能和VR等高精度应用中的使用。

Method: 基于可验证奖励的强化学习能力，引入图基群相对策略优化方法，在思维过程中引导模型推断场景的时空拓扑结构，并构建了包含20.5万个问答对的STV-205k数据集来支持训练。

Result: Video-STR在多个基准测试中取得最先进结果，在STI-Bench上比基础模型提升了13%，证明了方法和数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: Video-STR通过图基强化学习方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型在精确时空推理方面的局限性，为高精度应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

Motivation: 重新审视最简单的模型权重直接插值方法，探索其在推理轨迹上的动态行为，为性能-成本权衡提供原则性指导。

Method: 采用模型权重直接插值的简单方法，通过观察推理轨迹的三阶段演化范式，进行战略性模型插值。

Result: 战略性插值模型在效率和效果上均超越了复杂的模型融合基线方法，并通过消融研究验证了发现。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了模型插值的内在机制，为构建具有精确目标推理能力的模型提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在制造系统中，识别故障原因对维持和提高生产效率至关重要。知识库需要明确结构化系统知识和故障知识，并包含足够长的故障因果链。

Method: 构建诊断知识本体，提出基于功能-行为-结构(FBS)模型的维护记录积累方法。

Result: 使用该方法积累的维护记录进行故障原因推断，与专家列举的候选原因集有更好的一致性，特别是在相关案例少、使用词汇不同的困难情况下。

Conclusion: 未来需要开发针对这些维护记录的推断方法，构建用户界面，并在更大更复杂的系统上进行验证。该方法利用设计阶段对目标的理解和知识来支持维护阶段的知识积累和问题解决，有望成为整个工程链知识共享的基础。

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在法律环境中的部署面临透明度挑战，黑盒问题影响公平性、问责制和信任，需要符合法律要求的解释方法。

Method: 分析不同解释策略的优缺点，评估其在法律推理中的适用性，强调论证框架能够捕捉法律的可废止性、可争议性和价值敏感性。

Result: 论证框架为可解释法律AI提供了特别稳健的基础，能够满足法律领域透明度的技术和规范要求。

Conclusion: 计算论证最适合满足法律领域透明度的技术和规范要求，但仍需解决偏见缓解、司法环境实证验证等开放挑战。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Method: 基于先前建立的多层次智能体经济模型，采用仿真方法比较中美在不同机制（AI协作、网络效应、AI自主生产）下的宏观经济产出演变。

Result: 当AI作为独立生产实体时，社会产出增长率远超传统人力劳动模式；中国在智能体人口扩张和技术追赶速度上显示出明显加速潜力，有望实现技术趋同甚至部分超越。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

TL;DR: ARIA是一个基于规范驱动、人机协作的自动化可解释数据分析框架，通过自然语言规范定义分析目标，自动生成可执行代码并验证计算，实现透明文档化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据的快速增长导致分析能力与研究意图之间存在差距，现有AI分析工具要么偏向自动化而牺牲透明度，要么依赖手动脚本阻碍可扩展性和可重复性。

Method: ARIA集成六个互操作层（命令、上下文、代码、数据、编排和AI模块），采用文档中心化工作流统一人类推理和机器执行，通过自然语言规范驱动分析过程。

Result: 在波士顿房价案例中，ARIA发现了25个关键特征并确定XGBoost为最佳模型（R平方=0.93），过拟合最小。跨领域评估显示ARIA在性能、可解释性和效率方面优于现有系统。

Conclusion: ARIA通过将AI研究原则与科学原则结合在规范驱动架构中，为透明、协作和可重复的科学发现建立了新范式。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理在规划问题时需要回答如何做的问题来减少不确定性和填补知识空白，但这类问题的开放性使得AI代理难以有效提问，AI专家也难以给出支持高效规划的答案。

Method: 引入How2记忆代理框架，在Plancraft（Minecraft制作环境）中评估，使用在不同抽象层次回答的教师模型，从可执行动作序列到高级子目标描述。

Result: 终身学习代理从抽象化且与当前状态解耦的答案中获益最大。

Conclusion: How2为基于LLM的代理提供了一种通过在交互环境中提问来随时间提升规划能力的方法。

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了批评驱动推理对齐（CDRA）方法，将LLM对齐从标量奖励匹配重构为结构化推理过程，通过DeepPref基准和Pers-GenPRM模型解决用户深层偏好推断和防御性推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法推断用户的深层隐含偏好（包括未陈述的目标、语义上下文和风险容忍度），且缺乏应对现实世界模糊性的防御性推理能力，导致响应肤浅、脆弱和短视。

Method: 1）引入DeepPref基准数据集（3000个偏好查询对，涵盖20个主题）；2）提出个性化生成过程奖励模型（Pers-GenPRM），将奖励建模重构为个性化推理任务；3）通过批评驱动策略对齐进行过程级在线强化学习。

Result: 实验证明CDRA在发现和适应用户真实偏好方面表现优异，同时执行稳健的推理。

Conclusion: CDRA通过结构化推理过程有效解决了LLM个性化对齐中的认知差距问题，实现了更好的用户偏好推断和防御性推理能力。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

Method: 分析7种代表性AI对齐技术和7种故障模式，研究它们之间的重叠关系

Result: 发现不同对齐技术的故障模式存在不同程度的重叠，这对深度防御策略的有效性产生了影响

Conclusion: 深度防御策略的有效性取决于对齐技术故障模式的相关性，研究结果有助于理解当前风险水平和确定未来AI对齐研究的优先级

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

Conclusion: 基于图的程序表示为可靠和可泛化的执行提供了强大的中间抽象层。

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Conclusion: AAS为从"经验时代"迈向"模拟时代"提供了基础支撑，通过生成高质量模拟数据推动教育系统理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Conclusion: 该框架、基准和指标为开发本体论忠实的技能分解系统提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出维度级奖励模型(DRM)，通过置信度、相关性和连贯性三个维度评估推理过程质量，弥补了结果监督RL和过程级奖励模型的不足，提升LLM的多步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结果监督强化学习只奖励最终正确答案，存在稀疏奖励和传播错误推理的问题；过程级奖励模型虽然提供更密集的反馈，但缺乏泛化性和可解释性，需要任务特定的推理过程分割。

Method: 提出维度级奖励模型(DRM)，从三个基本维度评估推理过程：置信度用于不确定性校准，相关性用于语义对齐，连贯性用于逻辑一致性。这些维度无需真实答案即可进行可解释的评估。

Result: 实验结果表明DRM提供有效的监督信号，指导LLM优化并增强其推理能力。DRM监督训练在数学、问答、代码执行和谜题等开放领域任务上均取得一致提升，包括分布内和分布外任务。

Conclusion: 多维度的推理过程监督可以提升LLM在训练分布之外的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

Motivation: 现有方法将演绎推理和溯因推理孤立处理，而这两种推理范式具有明显的协同潜力——演绎可以验证假设，溯因可以发现更深层的逻辑模式。

Method: 使用掩码扩散模型捕获查询和结论之间的双向关系，引入自反去噪过程迭代生成和验证候选假设，并提出逻辑探索强化学习方法同时掩码查询和结论。

Result: 在多个基准知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，DARK在演绎和溯因推理任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 统一的推理方法具有显著优势，DARK框架成功地将演绎和溯因推理结合起来，展示了协同推理的有效性。

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI

for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CC-Gen基准生成器和CAP-CPT方法，用于解决LLM代理系统中政策文档内部化的问题，通过可控复杂度评估和政策分类持续预训练来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理系统的发展，政策文档快速膨胀导致计算开销增加，需要开发将政策文档嵌入模型先验的内部化方法，但现有提示压缩方法难以处理代理政策文档的多层次复杂性和深度推理需求。

Method: 引入CC-Gen基准生成器，提供四个可控复杂度级别；提出CAP-CPT方法，自动解析政策文档提取关键规范，分为事实性、行为性和条件性类别，通过自回归预训练损失实现政策内部化。

Result: CAP-CPT在所有设置下都优于SFT基线，在Qwen-3-32B上提升高达41%和22%，在CC-Gen上实现97.3%的提示长度减少，并在tau-Bench上仅需少量SFT数据即可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 复杂政策规范对工作流程构成主要推理挑战，CAP-CPT通过针对性数据合成和分类感知预训练有效减轻数据和推理负担，显著提升政策内部化效果。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

Motivation: 当前AI研究发表速度快但缺乏科学标准，导致政策制定者难以制定有效的治理机制，面临监管捕获和风险优先级不确定的问题。

Method: 通过借鉴其他科学领域的可重复性危机经验，提出采用预注册、提高统计功效和发表负面结果等可重复性协议。

Result: 分析表明加强可重复性协议可以帮助改善AI风险共识，为政策制定提供更可靠的科学基础。

Conclusion: 政策制定者应将可重复性协议作为AI治理的核心工具，要求AI研究达到更高的科学标准，同时保持治理的响应性。

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流失模型多为黑盒，缺乏对流失原因、干预时机和高风险客户群体的洞察，需要从单纯预测转向基于可解释证据的个性化保留策略。

Method: 集成可解释AI量化特征贡献、生存分析建模流失风险时间、RFM分析按交易行为细分客户的三组件框架。

Result: 能够识别流失驱动因素、估计干预窗口、优先处理需要针对性行动的高风险客户群体。

Conclusion: 该框架支持减少客户流失和增强客户忠诚度的策略，将预测与可解释的保留策略设计相结合。

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances,
general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges,
including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic
guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

TL;DR: 提出一个集成CCTV监控视频与多源数据的统一框架，用于实时城市交通预测，在CityFlowV2数据集上达到98.46%的准确率，能够有效发现交通序列模式并生成拥堵预警。


<details>

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法（如有限元法）在复杂声学材料波传播模拟中计算成本高昂，特别是在大规模或实时场景下。需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用基于Stable Diffusion和ControlNet的深度学习方法，将解表示为图像，利用GPU并行化同时处理多个模拟，无需复杂仿真软件和显式方程求解。

Result: 方法能够大幅减少计算时间，扩散步骤可在推理时调整以平衡速度和质量，适合早期研究阶段的快速探索。

Conclusion: 基于深度学习的方法在早期研究阶段特别有用，此时快速探索比绝对精度更重要，为声学材料设计提供了高效的计算工具。

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出GradFix方法，通过近似新模型的梯度符号结构来跨预训练模型迁移任务向量，仅需少量标注样本即可实现知识迁移，无需额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当发布新的基础模型时，即使相同任务已在先前版本中解决，实践者通常需要重复完整微调。任务向量虽然能捕获模型如何适应特定任务，但由于参数空间不对齐，往往无法在不同预训练模型间成功迁移。

Method: GradFix方法通过计算目标模型的少量梯度来近似理想的梯度符号结构，然后根据该结构对源任务向量进行掩码处理，产生与目标损失地形局部对齐的更新，从而将任务向量重新基于新的预训练。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中表现出显著性能提升，始终优于朴素的任务向量相加和少样本微调方法。

Conclusion: 该方法的关键在于新模型的梯度符号结构，通过理论保证确保一阶下降，提供了一种高效的任务向量跨模型迁移解决方案。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NOvA实验需要将探测器中的原始命中点匹配到源粒子并识别粒子类型，传统方法使用聚类和CNN，但由于探测器结构，数据以稀疏的XZ和YZ二维图像形式呈现，而非3D表示。

Method: 提出点集神经网络，在稀疏矩阵上操作，通过混合两个视图信息的操作来处理数据。

Result: 模型内存使用比先前方法减少90%以上，AUC得分达到96.8%，高于两个视图独立处理时的85.4%。

Conclusion: 点集神经网络在处理NOvA实验稀疏探测器数据方面比传统CNN方法更高效且性能更好。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

TL;DR: 提出了谱各向异性高斯扩散(SAGD)，通过引入各向异性噪声算子来构建扩散模型的归纳偏置，在多个视觉数据集上优于标准扩散模型，并能选择性忽略特定频带的已知损坏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型(DPMs)虽然取得了强大的生成性能，但其归纳偏置大多隐含。本研究旨在将归纳偏置明确构建到扩散模型的训练和采样过程中，以更好地适应目标数据分布。

Method: 引入各向异性噪声算子，用结构化的频率对角协方差替换各向同性前向协方差。该算子统一了带通掩码和幂律加权，允许强调或抑制指定频带，同时保持前向过程的高斯性。推导了各向异性协方差的得分关系。

Result: 经验证明，诱导的各向异性在多个视觉数据集上优于标准扩散模型，并实现了选择性忽略：在特定频带中忽略已知损坏的同时进行学习。

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在DPMs中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而有原则的调控手段。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的损失函数log-B和log-BW，用于电化学阻抗谱数据的等效电路模型拟合。通过大规模数据集评估，发现X2损失函数在拟合质量上表现最佳，而log-B在计算效率和MAPE方面有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电化学阻抗谱数据使用等效电路模型进行建模，通过非线性最小二乘拟合获得参数。现有损失函数在收敛性、计算效率和拟合质量方面存在局限性，需要开发更优的损失函数。

Method: 从EIS的Bode表示推导出两种新损失函数log-B和log-BW。使用生成的大规模EIS数据集，评估新损失函数与现有损失函数在R2分数、卡方值、计算效率和MAPE等方面的性能。

Result: 统计比较表明，损失函数的选择影响收敛性、计算效率、拟合质量和MAPE。X2损失函数在多个拟合质量指标上表现最佳，而log-B虽然拟合质量略低，但计算速度快约1.4倍，且对大多数电路元件产生更低的MAPE。

Conclusion: 当拟合质量是主要目标时，X2损失函数是最佳选择；对于大规模最小二乘拟合应用（如机器学习模型训练），log-B是一个强大的替代方案，在计算效率和MAPE方面具有优势。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法相对于最先进方法的优越性

Conclusion: SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏方案，有效解决了跨模态哈希中的语义兼容性问题，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前LLM推理系统将引擎和查询独立处理导致资源效率低下，虽然已有避免冗余计算和提升GPU利用率的提案，但缺乏高效的KV缓存卸载和通信机制。

Method: LMCache提取并存储现代LLM引擎生成的KV缓存，支持缓存卸载（跨查询前缀重用）和预填充-解码解耦（跨引擎缓存传输），采用批处理数据移动、计算与I/O流水线等优化技术。

Result: 评估显示LMCache与vLLM结合在各种工作负载下实现高达15倍的吞吐量提升，已被企业推理系统广泛采用。

Conclusion: LMCache通过高效的KV缓存共享机制显著提升了LLM推理系统的资源效率，其模块化设计和控制API为未来KV缓存解决方案提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source
code of LMCache is at: https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Motivation: 在高维混杂因素存在的情况下，双机器学习中因果估计的准确性依赖于条件期望函数估计器的性能，传统方法仅调整模型嵌入存在局限性

Method: 利用在历史数据上训练的生成模型进行预测，将LLM生成的猜测作为预测因子纳入估计过程

Result: 在在线珠宝拍卖的小型数据集案例研究中，包含LLM生成的预测因子可以提高估计效率

Conclusion: 生成模型的历史知识和推理能力有助于克服因果推断中的维度诅咒问题

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential
equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic
design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 研究不仅影响神经网络训练实践，还建立了关键学习期与热启动训练研究之间的重要联系，为改进训练方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护了原始数据隐私，但固定隐私预算的差分隐私方法在模型收敛时会引入过多噪声，影响模型性能。需要探索自适应方法来平衡隐私保护和模型准确性。

Method: 使用Laplace和Gaussian机制实现自适应隐私预算，在Gaussian机制中引入自适应裁剪方法，动态更新梯度敏感性而非使用固定值。基于SelecEval模拟器进行扩展实验。

Result: 在200轮训练中，通过不同隐私预算、IID和非IID数据集以及不同客户端选择策略的实验表明，自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪有助于在保护隐私的同时维持模型准确率。

Conclusion: 自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪是有效的技术，能够在联邦学习环境中更好地平衡隐私保护和模型性能，但实验轮数有限，需要进一步验证。

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PDE解析解稀少且网格求解器在高维情况下成本高昂，需要评估无网格神经求解器的性能和适用性。

Method: 在统一协议下比较PINNs、DRM和WANs三种方法，应用于泊松问题（最高5D）和薛定谔方程（1D/2D），并扩展到KH变换下的激光驱动薛定谔方程。

Result: 所有方法在强制边界条件和正交正则化下都能达到10^-6到10^-9的低L2误差。PINNs在精度和激发谱恢复方面最可靠；DRM在稳态问题上提供最佳精度-运行时间权衡；WAN在有效使用弱形式约束时具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 物理引导的神经求解器是解决复杂PDE的可信、可扩展工具，论文提供了方法选择指南并提出了时间相关公式、自适应采样等扩展方向。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kelp是一个新颖的流式风险检测插件框架，通过建模LM生成过程中的潜在状态动态变化，实现实时风险检测，相比后处理检测方法性能更高且延迟更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护措施多为后处理检测，可能在检测到不安全内容前就已暴露，且延迟限制使其倾向于使用轻量级模型，限制了检测准确性。

Method: 提出Kelp框架，利用Streaming Latent Dynamics Head建模生成序列中风险的时间演化，引入Anchored Temporal Consistency损失强制单调危害预测，并构建StreamGuardBench基准进行严格评估。

Result: 在各种模型和数据集上，Kelp始终优于最先进的后处理防护措施和现有插件探针（平均F1提高15.61%），仅使用20M参数且每token延迟增加不到0.5毫秒。

Conclusion: Kelp提供了一个高效、准确的流式风险检测解决方案，能够在LM生成过程中实时识别有害内容，显著提升了防护效果和效率。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Motivation: 深度神经网络规模增大需要压缩技术，但直接应用压缩方法会导致严重的精度下降，需要一种平滑过渡的方法来缓解这个问题。

Method: VCON方法在微调期间并行执行原始模型和压缩模型，逐步减少原始模型的贡献，同时逐步增加压缩模型的贡献，实现平滑过渡。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，VCON结合多种压缩策略均带来一致改进，典型增益超过3%，某些配置的精度提升达到20%。

Conclusion: VCON提供了一个可推广的方法，可应用于现有的压缩技术，在多个基准测试中均显示出一致的性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态特征排除策略往往无法防止偏见，因为隐藏的依赖关系会影响模型预测。需要一种能够自适应选择特征并集成公平性考虑的方法。

Method: 构建强化学习框架，使用多组件奖励函数，定义特征子集的动作空间，并与集成学习相结合，让智能体根据预测性能和公平性奖励自适应选择特征。

Result: 该方法提供了一种灵活且可泛化的特征选择方式，特别适用于预测因子相关且偏见可能无意中重新出现的环境。

Conclusion: 强化学习框架能够动态平衡泛化能力、准确性和公平性，相比传统的预处理调整或后处理校正机制更具优势。

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

Conclusion: 提出的群体自适应对抗训练策略有效提升了假新闻检测模型在面对多样化对抗攻击时的鲁棒性，同时保持了良好的检测性能。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏统计保证，或依赖于易被违反的强假设，需要一种能严格控制错误发现率的训练数据识别方法。

Method: 使用已知未见数据计算每个数据点的p值，构建测试集数据使用比例的保守估计器来缩放p值，然后通过数据依赖阈值选择训练数据集。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的实验表明，PTDI能严格控制错误发现率，并实现更高的检测能力。

Conclusion: PTDI提供了一种具有严格统计保证的训练数据识别方法，在版权诉讼、隐私审计和公平评估中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了在保护数据隐私的前提下进行分布式聚类分析。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文向量有效表示模型能力，实现了高性能且可扩展的模型路由，解决了现有方法的可扩展性限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

### [332] [ARROW: An Adaptive Rollout and Routing Method for Global Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09734)
*Jindong Tian,Yifei Ding,Ronghui Xu,Hao Miao,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ARROW方法，一种自适应滚动多尺度时间路由的全球天气预报方法，通过多时间尺度建模和自适应滚动调度解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的天气预报方法通常基于固定短时间间隔建模，依赖朴素自回归进行长期预测，存在两个关键问题：无法充分建模全球天气系统的空间和多尺度时间依赖关系；滚动策略难以平衡误差累积与精细大气变化捕捉。

Method: 构建多间隔预测模型，使用共享-私有专家混合机制捕获不同时间尺度的共享模式和特定特征，采用环形位置编码准确表示地球的纬度结构；开发基于强化学习的自适应滚动调度器，根据当前天气状态选择最合适的时间间隔进行预测。

Result: 实验结果表明ARROW在全球天气预报中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARROW为全球天气预报领域建立了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

*Qianyou Sun,Jiexin Zheng,Bohan Jin,Lihua Chen,Yijie Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InterCorpRel-LLM框架，结合图神经网络和大型语言模型，用于识别企业间供应和竞争关系，在供应关系识别任务上显著优于GPT-5等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业间关系识别对金融分析和公司治理至关重要，但现有方法面临数据规模大、稀疏性和上下文依赖等挑战。图方法缺乏语义深度，LLM难以表示关系依赖。

Method: 提出跨模态框架InterCorpRel-LLM，集成GNN与LLM，使用FactSet供应链专有数据集，设计三个训练任务：公司图匹配、行业分类和供应关系预测。

Result: 在供应关系识别任务上，F-score达到0.8543，显著优于GPT-5的0.2287，仅使用7B参数骨干网络和轻量训练。模型还能零样本泛化到竞争者识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析师和策略师提供了强大的工具，能够映射和推理复杂的企业网络，增强动态市场中的决策制定和风险管理能力。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习从形容词列表构建自下而上的人格模型，与Big Five模型对比分析Reddit评论，发现Big Five模型更具描述力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证词汇假说，测试机器学习能否替代传统心理学理论来构建人格模型。

Method: 使用经典形容词列表通过机器学习构建人格模型，与Big Five模型对比分析100万条Reddit评论。

Result: Big Five模型（特别是宜人性、尽责性和神经质）对在线社区描述力更强、更可解释；机器学习聚类未能提供有意义的区分，未能恢复外向性特质，缺乏心理测量一致性。

Conclusion: Big Five模型具有稳健性，人格的语义结构具有情境依赖性；机器学习可用于检验现有心理学理论的生态效度，但可能无法替代它们。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

*Atharv Goel,Sharat Agarwal,Saket Anand,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出NCAL-R框架，利用深度网络的几何规律性来提升主动学习的可靠性，通过类均值对齐扰动和特征波动评分来对抗噪声标签和数据分布偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在标签噪声或数据分布偏移时可靠性下降，因为不确定性、多样性等启发式方法会放大错误标签或冗余样本的影响。

Method: NCAL-R引入两个互补信号：类均值对齐扰动评分（量化样本对类间几何结构的稳定/扭曲程度）和特征波动评分（捕捉训练过程中表征的时间不稳定性）。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上的实验表明，NCAL-R始终优于标准主动学习基线，在合成标签噪声下具有更高的准确性和更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入样本选择决策可以使主动学习对标注错误和分布偏移更具鲁棒性，是实现真实世界标注管道可信部署的关键一步。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

TL;DR: ProtoMM是一个新颖的自监督学习框架，通过共享原型字典将异质模态锚定在共同嵌入空间中，避免了对比学习方法的局限性，在生物信号多模态建模中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方法依赖CLIP风格的对比目标，容易过拟合到易于对齐的特征，并将有效的跨模态关系误分类为负样本，导致碎片化和不可泛化的嵌入。

Method: 引入共享原型字典，通过将表示聚类到共享原型周围而非显式负采样，在共同嵌入空间中捕获跨模态的互补信息。

Result: ProtoMM在Pulse Motion基础模型中优于仅对比学习和先前的多模态SSL方法，实现了最先进的性能，并提供更好的特征可解释性。

Conclusion: ProtoMM通过共享原型字典提供了一种连贯的"共同语言"，能够更好地捕捉生理信号中的系统级动态，解决了传统对比学习方法在多模态时间序列建模中的局限性。

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图Transformer在异构图上存在两个主要问题：二次计算复杂度限制了可扩展性；无法有效建模异构语义，导致语义混合。

Method: 引入槽感知结构编码器，将异构特征投影到独立槽中并通过槽归一化和保留融合对齐分布；用保留机制编码器替代自注意力，实现线性时间复杂度的依赖建模；使用异构保留编码器联合捕获局部结构信号和全局异构语义。

Result: 在四个真实世界异构图数据集上的实验表明，HeSRN在节点分类任务上持续优于最先进的异构图神经网络和图Transformer基线，以显著更低的计算复杂度实现更优的准确率。

Conclusion: HeSRN通过解耦异构语义和线性复杂度的保留机制，有效解决了图Transformer在异构图上的可扩展性和语义建模问题，为异构图表示学习提供了高效且表达力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索在几何任务（如学习原子间势能）中，等变性（equivariance）如何影响模型在不同规模下的表现，特别是验证对称性等归纳偏置在规模化时的重要性。

Method: 采用经验研究方法，在不同规模的数据、参数和计算资源下，比较等变性和非等变性架构的性能，分析其缩放行为。

Result: 发现等变性架构比非等变性架构缩放更好，且高阶表示对应更优的缩放指数。数据和模型大小应同步缩放以实现计算最优。

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，在规模化时不应让模型自行发现对称性等基本归纳偏置，因为这些偏置改变了任务的内在难度和缩放规律。

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

Method: 通过In-Context Learning理论框架，在AR(p)数据假设下分析线性自注意力模型的性能极限，包括理论推导和实验验证。

Result: 理论证明：(1)线性自注意力模型无法获得比经典线性模型更低的期望MSE；(2)当上下文长度趋近无穷时，LSA渐近恢复最优线性预测器；(3)在思维链推理下，预测会指数级坍缩到均值。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的根本理论限制，建议研究社区重新审视复杂架构的直接应用，并设计更有效的预测架构。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 该研究为更安全的智能体系统提供了实用模板，通过在规划阶段进行风险干预，实现了对LLM智能体的可控监督和安全防护。

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

TL;DR: 提出了Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB)方法，结合时间延迟信息瓶颈和扩散模型，在分子科学中实现高效表示学习和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维分子科学中，数据收集昂贵且重要事件罕见，需要压缩到低维流形以支持下游生成任务。

Method: 结合时间延迟信息瓶颈和扩散模型，通过联合训练目标平衡表示学习和生成目标，能够整合不同温度轨迹信息。

Result: 在多个分子任务上进行了基准测试，展示了探索训练集外物理条件的潜力。

Conclusion: D-SPIB提供了一种灵活架构，能够同时优化表示学习和生成目标，在分子科学中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的傅里叶神经算子FNOtD，通过整合时空信息来增强海洋PDE求解的物理保真度和长期预测稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经算子在海洋预报中存在长期预测不稳定和物理规律遵循不足的问题，特别是在高频过程建模方面。

Method: 将标准FNO改进为FNOtD，通过整合时间傅里叶模态和内化色散关系来学习海洋PDE的解算子。

Result: FNOtD显著提高了长期预测稳定性，在挑战性高频环境下与基础物理动力学保持更好的一致性，计算成本远低于最先进的数值海洋模型。

Conclusion: 在积分核训练中整合时空信息能够有效捕捉多尺度波传播，提升海洋动力学学习效果，为高分辨率海洋预测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

*Lianghuan Huang,Yingshan Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了在视觉Transformer中，可解码性和因果性之间的系统性不匹配：中间层对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，而最终层对象token支持准确解码但功能惰性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机制可解释性研究面临的一个持续挑战是区分两个常被混淆的概念：可解码性（从隐藏状态恢复信息的能力）和因果性（这些状态对输出的功能影响程度）。

Method: 使用激活修补技术测试空间和CLS token的因果作用，通过移植干净-损坏图像对之间的激活；同时训练线性探针评估不同深度的计数信息可解码性。

Result: 发现中间层对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，最终层对象token支持准确解码但功能惰性；CLS token在中间层变得可解码但仅在最终层获得因果能力。

Conclusion: 可解码性和因果性反映了表征的互补维度——存在什么信息与使用什么信息——它们的分歧可以揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的提升训练框架，通过将深度神经网络训练转化为高维约束优化问题，解决了传统梯度下降方法面临的梯度消失/爆炸、非光滑激活函数处理困难等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的深度神经网络训练方法面临梯度消失/爆炸、非光滑激活函数处理困难以及顺序结构限制并行化等问题，需要替代性训练方法。

Method: 采用提升训练策略，将嵌套优化问题转化为高维约束优化问题，使用惩罚项替代直接约束，并利用Bregman距离等凸优化工具实现分布式优化。

Result: 数值实验表明，在标准成像任务中，提升Bregman方法相比传统训练具有更好的有效性和稳定性，特别适用于使用近端激活函数的架构。

Conclusion: 提升训练框架为深度神经网络训练提供了有效的替代方案，能够处理非光滑激活函数、改善训练条件，并支持分布式优化。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续时间动力系统中近奇异行为的正则化问题，同时保持系统的守恒定律，为机器学习中的物理信息神经网络和其他潜在流架构提供稳定性。

Method: 引入平滑单调映射t↦τ(t)的时间提升方法，在提升坐标中使轨迹全局光滑，连接解析正则性理论与表示学习方法。

Result: 在提升坐标中，如环面T^3上的不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程等轨迹变得全局光滑，能够稳定物理信息神经网络和潜在流架构。

Conclusion: 时间提升框架将解析正则性理论与刚性或湍流过程的表示学习方法联系起来，作为连续时间归一化或时间扭曲算子发挥作用。

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

TL;DR: 该论文系统探索了神经网络中梯度下降方法的规范选择，提出了新的MuonMax优化器变体，并将其与模型动量(Momo)结合，显著提高了超参数鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定义神经网络中的最速下降方法需要为每层选择规范、跨层聚合规范的方式以及是否使用归一化，现有方法如Adam和Muon存在超参数敏感性问题。

Method: 系统探索跨层规范聚合的不同替代方案，将Adam和Muon形式化为非欧几里得梯度下降类型，推导新的Muon优化器变体，并与模型动量(Momo)结合。

Result: Muon对学习率选择敏感，而新的MuonMax变体显著更鲁棒；与Momo结合的Muon变体对超参数调整更鲁棒，通常获得更好的验证分数。

Conclusion: 对于新任务，建议使用Momo与MuonMax组合，以节省昂贵的超参数调整成本。

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法（如PC、NOTEARS等）存在无法确定因果方向、仅限于线性关联、对忠实性假设敏感以及搜索效率低等问题，而大语言模型虽然推理能力强但不适合表格数据。

Method: 采用Mamba架构，整合局部因果分数、条件独立性检验和关系属性等多种证据，在合成数据和10个真实生物数据集上训练，捕捉线性和非线性因果机制。

Conclusion: CALM成功将语言模型的模式识别能力应用于表格数据，为准确且可泛化的因果发现迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

TL;DR: ProxRouter是一种非参数化查询路由器，通过指数倾斜聚合机制平衡偏差和方差，提高对异常查询的路由鲁棒性，同时保持正常查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化路由器需要重新训练和维护，非参数化路由器虽然无需训练，但在处理异常查询时泛化能力不足，且训练集多样性有限且更新成本高。

Method: 使用指数倾斜聚合机制来平衡非参数化路由器中的偏差和方差，提高对异常查询的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明ProxRouter在保持正常查询性能的同时，显著提升了异常查询的路由效果，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ProxRouter通过创新的聚合机制有效解决了非参数化路由器在处理异常查询时的泛化问题，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

Motivation: 现有网页导航基准未能充分评估AI代理在子任务（如日期选择器操作、容器滚动等短时交互）上的能力，而这些子任务对于复杂网页导航至关重要。

Method: 使用Web ARChive文件创建沙盒化的动态网页交互环境，探索监督微调（SFT）和基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）两种训练方法。

Result: SFT模型在基准测试中达到48.8%成功率，RLVR在SFT基础上进一步提升至52.8%，优于许多前沿模型。最高观察到的成功率为64.8%。

Conclusion: 掌握网页子任务对于稳健的网页规划和导航至关重要，这是现有基准测试未充分评估的能力。

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

Result: ParBaLS EPIG在多个数据集上对固定预算和贝叶斯逻辑回归表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯决策理论为主动学习提供了统一框架，ParBaLS EPIG是有效的批量选择方法。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了TAWRMAC框架，通过整合时序匿名游走、内存增强和邻居共现嵌入，解决了现有连续时间动态图表示学习方法的三个关键挑战：嵌入陈旧、邻居相关性缺失和结构动态捕捉不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续时间动态图学习方法存在三个主要问题：仅依赖节点特定内存导致嵌入陈旧；未能显式捕捉节点邻居间的相关性；无法充分捕捉演化图的结构动态，特别是在缺乏丰富链接属性的情况下。

Method: TAWRMAC框架整合了时序匿名游走重启机制、内存增强和邻居共现嵌入。使用内存增强的GNN和固定时间编码提升嵌入稳定性，通过显式捕捉邻居相关性改进上下文表示，时序匿名游走重启机制能区分重复交互和形成新连接的节点。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAWRMAC在动态链接预测和节点分类任务中，在转导和归纳设置下，使用三种不同负采样策略时，始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TAWRMAC通过提供稳定、可泛化和上下文感知的嵌入，推进了连续时间动态图学习的技术水平，在动态链接预测和节点分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文研究在重尾噪声下的稳健非参数回归，使用Huber回归作为示例，提出了基于预测误差而非泛化误差的学习性度量方法，解决了无界假设空间和弱矩假设下的分析挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稳健损失的泛化误差界限不能真实反映样本外性能，且在无界函数空间和重尾噪声下，标准浓度工具失效，需要新的分析框架来量化稳健学习。

Method: 引入概率有效假设空间，建立将超额稳健风险与L2预测误差联系起来的新比较定理，在再生核希尔伯特空间中分析Tikhonov正则化风险最小化。

Result: 在无一致有界性和重尾噪声条件下，为RKHS中的Huber回归推导了明确的有限样本误差界限和收敛速率，阐明了由尺度参数σ引起的稳健性-偏差权衡。

Conclusion: 预测误差而非超额泛化风险应作为分析稳健学习的基本视角，研究提供了原则性的调参规则，并可推广到其他稳健损失函数。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于条件变分自编码器的概率误差校正框架，用于北极海冰浓度的季节性预测，能够生成大样本调整预测，改善校准性和减少误差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的北极海冰浓度季节性预测系统存在系统性偏差和复杂时空误差，传统确定性后处理方法无法充分量化不确定性，而决策制定需要适当的概率信息特别是极端事件的可能性

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器模型构建观测条件分布映射，基于有偏差的模型预测生成大量调整后的预测样本

Result: 调整后的预测在校准性、与观测分布的接近程度以及误差方面均优于基于气候平均的调整预测

Conclusion: 该概率误差校正框架能够有效改善北极海冰浓度季节性预测的质量，为决策提供更可靠的不确定性信息

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

*Yubo Li,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Chain-of-Influence (CoI)框架，通过显式建模临床变量间随时间传播的影响关系，提供可解释的时间序列预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法显式建模临床变量间的时间依赖性影响传播，缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用多级注意力架构：时间注意力层识别关键时间点，跨特征注意力层建模特征间的定向影响，构建时间展开的影响图

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集和慢性肾病队列上，CoI在预测准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能揭示有临床意义的患者特异性疾病进展模式

Conclusion: CoI框架提供了前所未有的透明度，能够追踪影响路径，为临床决策提供可解释的时间序列分析

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

*Hung Phan,Son Le Vu,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2J是一个通过提示增强框架来改进LLM从PyTorch到JAX代码翻译的方法，通过构建修复后的数据集和结构化指导，显著提升了翻译质量、运行效率和错误修复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PyTorch和JAX虽然都基于Python，但在核心设计、执行语义和生态系统成熟度上存在显著差异，且JAX相对较新，公开代码资源有限，现有评估方法在跨框架基准测试方面存在不足。

Method: 构建两阶段流程：(1)使用GPT-4o-mini从TorchLeet和CodeParrot数据集中生成初始JAX代码；(2)专业开发者迭代修复生成代码，构建包含常见错误和修复的精选数据集；(3)基于修复数据构建增强提示来指导轻量级LLM。

Result: T2J显著提升了GPT-4o-mini的性能：CodeBLEU提升10%，T2J FixCost Score提升50%，T2J CodeTrans Score提升1.33分(0-4分制)，T2J Comparison Score提升100%，生成代码运行速度比基线快2.5倍。

Conclusion: T2J框架通过系统化的数据收集、人工修复和提示增强，有效解决了PyTorch到JAX代码翻译的挑战，为跨框架代码转换提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer中Layer Normalization的不同放置位置进行了系统性研究，分析了前向传播（隐藏状态）和后向传播（梯度）的稳定性，为Transformer训练稳定性提供了理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer被广泛使用，但其训练过程可能不稳定。Layer Normalization作为标准组件能提高稳定性，但其放置位置往往缺乏理论依据，需要系统研究不同放置方式对训练稳定性的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析研究不同Layer Normalization放置位置下Transformer的前向稳定性和后向稳定性，推导隐藏状态增长的显式边界，分析Layer Normalization对梯度反向传播的影响，并指导残差连接步长的缩放。

Result: 理论分析揭示了不同Layer Normalization放置位置的训练动态，数值结果验证了理论发现。适当的残差步长缩放可以进一步提高稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: 该研究框架为检查新架构修改下Transformer稳定性提供了原则性方法，为未来设计提供指导。Layer Normalization的合理放置和残差步长缩放对训练稳定性至关重要。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive
biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based
generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from
large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

Abstract: Excess alcohol consumption leads to serious health risks and severe
consequences for both individuals and their communities. To advocate for
healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch
application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,

TL;DR: AutoGD是一种自动调整学习率的梯度下降方法，无需用户手动调参，能够自动决定何时增加或减少学习率，并在多种优化任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度下降等优化方法的性能高度依赖于学习率的选择，但手动调整学习率需要大量用户调参工作。当这些方法作为其他算法的内循环时，期望用户调整学习率是不现实的。

Method: 提出AutoGD方法，自动确定在给定迭代中是否增加或减少学习率。该方法无需知道平滑度常数，能够恢复梯度下降的最优速率（最多相差一个常数）。

Result: 在传统问题和变分推断优化任务上的实验表明，该方法性能强劲，其扩展版本AutoBFGS和AutoLBFGS也表现良好。

Conclusion: AutoGD解决了梯度下降方法中学习率调参的难题，为自动化优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

*Naman Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了复数卷积神经网络(CVCNNs)在音频信号处理中的应用，重点研究如何保留和利用实值网络中常被忽略的相位信息。通过理论分析和三个阶段的实验验证，证明了复数架构的表达能力和相位作为音频处理中有用特征的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实值神经网络在处理音频信号时往往忽略相位信息，而相位在音频处理中具有重要价值。本研究旨在探索复数神经网络如何更好地保留和利用相位信息，提升音频处理任务的性能。

Method: 提出复数卷积神经网络的理论框架，包括复数卷积、池化层、Wirtinger微分和各种复数激活函数。采用复数批归一化和权重初始化方案确保训练稳定性。通过三个阶段实验：在图像数据集上基准测试、基于MFCC的音频分类、以及使用GNN建模相位信息的实验。

Result: 在图像数据集上，CVCNNs与实值CNN表现相当；在音频分类中，CVCNNs在实值MFCC上略优于实值CNN；通过GNN建模相位信息在二元和多类流派分类中都带来了可测量的性能提升。

Conclusion: 复数架构具有强大的表达能力，相位是音频处理中有意义且可利用的特征。虽然当前方法（特别是cardioid激活函数）显示出潜力，但未来需要相位感知设计的进一步改进来充分发挥复数表示在神经网络中的潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MemPromptTSS框架，通过引入持久提示记忆来解决时间序列多粒度分割中提示信号影响范围有限的问题，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割方法中的提示机制只能在局部上下文起作用，提示的影响会快速消失，无法在整个序列中指导预测。需要一种能让提示影响持久化的方法。

Method: 使用记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为记忆令牌存储在记忆库中，使每个新预测不仅能基于局部线索，还能基于所有迭代中积累的提示，确保其影响在整个序列中持续存在。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验显示，MemPromptTSS在单次迭代推理中比最佳基线在单粒度和多粒度分割上分别提升了23%和85%的准确率，在迭代推理中每次迭代平均增益为2.66个百分点，优于PromptTSS的1.19。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对于提示引导的分割至关重要，MemPromptTSS为实际应用提供了一个实用有效的框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

Motivation: 边缘-云推测解码中，边缘-云链路的有限带宽限制了草稿令牌分布的高效压缩，这是加速推理的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出SQS-SD框架，包含K-SQS（固定top-K截断）和C-SQS（通过在线符合预测自适应调整保留令牌集）两种方法，利用分布稀疏性进行压缩。

Result: 实证结果表明，两种方法在互补的操作机制下都能改善端到端延迟和拒绝率。

Conclusion: 信息论分析指导下的SQS-SD框架有效解决了边缘-云推测解码中的带宽限制问题，通过分布稀疏化实现了高效的令牌分布压缩。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

Motivation: 传统不完全多视图谱聚类方法需要在特征提取后执行K-means算法生成聚类结果，且未有效利用样本连通性信息。

Method: 对提取的特征施加非负约束直接获得聚类结果，基于谱聚类结果构建连通性矩阵，并最小化基于连通性矩阵的自表示残差。使用乘法更新迭代算法求解优化问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CRG_IMSC优于最先进的聚类方法，实验证明了算法的收敛性。

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC有效解决了不完全多视图谱聚类的缺陷，实现了更好的聚类性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

Conclusion: FPO为基于流匹配的视觉-语言-动作模型提供了稳定可扩展的在线强化学习微调方法，消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

TL;DR: 本文提出GeminiNet，一种统一神经网络方法，从函数调用图(FCGs)和进程调用图(PCGs)学习联合嵌入，通过双图卷积分支和自适应门控机制平衡静态和动态视图的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多专注于单一类型的图表示，而函数调用图和进程交互图的联合建模尚未充分探索，这为软件系统的多视角分析提供了机会。

Method: 构建FCGs和PCGs的训练流程，提出GeminiNet使用双图卷积分支和自适应门控机制来学习联合嵌入。

Result: 在635个Windows可执行文件数据集上，联合嵌入模型优于单图模型。

Conclusion: 联合建模FCGs和PCGs能够提供更深入的软件系统多视角分析，GeminiNet方法有效整合了静态和动态视图。

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化方法，通过精确Lipschitz证书和Wasserstein分布攻击来提供更紧的上界保证，在ReLU网络上实现精确可处理的WDRO问题表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于全局Lipschitz连续性或强对偶性的WDRO方法存在上界过松或计算成本过高的问题，需要更精确和高效的方法。

Method: 采用原始方法，引入精确Lipschitz证书来收紧WDRO上界，并提出Wasserstein分布攻击直接构造最坏情况分布候选，利用ReLU网络在激活单元上的分段仿射结构。

Result: 在广泛评估中，该方法在保持与最先进基线竞争性的鲁棒准确率的同时，提供了比现有方法更紧的证书。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化中实现了更紧的上界保证和灵活的攻防能力，为ReLU网络提供了精确可处理的WDRO问题解决方案。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: BITE是一个双向时频金字塔网络，通过多流协同、金字塔时频注意力和双向自适应卷积，解决了EEG识别模型跨范式泛化能力差的问题，在多个脑机接口任务中实现了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG识别模型由于数据集特定约束和个体变异性，在跨范式泛化方面表现不佳，需要开发一种能够克服这些限制的统一架构。

Method: 提出BITE端到端统一架构，包含对齐的时频流保持时间同步、PTFA多尺度特征增强、BiTCN双向自适应卷积捕获前向/后向神经动态。

Result: 在四个不同范式（BCICIV-2A/2B、HGD、SD-SSVEP）上实现最先进性能，在受试者内准确性和跨受试者泛化方面均表现出色，兼具计算效率。

Conclusion: 范式对齐的频谱-时间处理对于可靠的脑机接口系统至关重要，BITE验证了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

TL;DR: STAT是一种新的微调策略，通过利用更强LLM的元认知能力作为教师，创建技能列表并跟踪学生模型的缺失技能，然后通过重新加权现有训练样本(STAT-Sel)或合成新样本(STAT-Syn)来针对性训练，显著提升数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调在训练数据与预训练数据相似时往往效果有限，存在"饱和"现象，需要更有效的训练策略来突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 使用更强LLM作为教师：1)创建任务所需技能列表并标注数据点的技能需求；2)监控学生回答，建立缺失技能档案；3)通过STAT-Sel(重新加权现有样本)或STAT-Syn(合成新样本)构建修改后的训练集。

Result: 在MATH数据集上提升达7.5%，而SFT仅提供有限增益；在分布外基准测试(AIME24/25, AMC23等)上平均提升4.6%；与GRPO强化学习互补，能进一步增加收益。

Conclusion: 技能导向的自适应训练应该广泛改进当前训练流程，STAT方法为解决模型技能缺失问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 无人机搭载视觉语言模型为实时多模态推理提供了有前景的解决方案，但由于机载资源有限和网络条件动态变化，确保推理准确性和通信效率仍面临挑战。

Method: 设计了分层优化框架：ARPO算法用于在精度约束下进行资源分配，LLaRA方法利用大语言模型离线优化强化学习的奖励设计，实现自适应无人机轨迹优化。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决无人机视觉问答系统中的准确性与效率平衡问题提供了有效的优化框架，特别是在资源受限的动态网络环境中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要大量环境交互，计算成本高，特别是在复杂环境中。PPOPT旨在通过预训练提高训练效率，减少环境交互需求。

Method: 采用新型策略神经网络架构，中间部分为预训练网络，两端为全连接网络。在具有相似物理特性的环境中预训练部分网络，以利用可转移的物理特征知识。

Result: PPOPT在小样本训练中优于经典PPO算法，在奖励获取和训练稳定性方面表现更好。虽然不如DYNA DDPG等基于模型的方法，但无模型特性使其训练时间显著减少。

Conclusion: PPOPT通过预训练有效提高了强化学习在物理环境中的训练效率，特别适合计算资源有限或环境交互成本高的场景。

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Motivation: 解决小规模和类别不平衡生物医学数据集中深度学习模型优化不稳定和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 使用软最大不确定性作为连续难度度量，构建四阶段课程学习（简单到极难），将FOSSIL集成到卷积和基于transformer的架构中，用于Mpox皮肤病变诊断。

Result: 在所有设置下，FOSSIL显著提高了判别能力（AUC = 0.9573）、校准能力（ECE = 0.053）以及在真实世界扰动下的鲁棒性，优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: FOSSIL是一个可泛化、数据高效且可解释的框架，适用于医学成像中数据稀缺情况下的难度感知学习。

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的方法往往忽略实际稳定性约束，并且在处理不同箱子尺寸时泛化能力有限。为了解决这些限制，需要开发一个能够同时处理多种箱子尺寸并考虑支撑和重量约束的框架。

Method: 提出了O4M-SP框架，采用加权奖励函数结合装载率和高度差指标，促进更平坦的装箱配置。同时结合裁剪策略梯度优化和定制的策略漂移方法，避免策略熵崩溃，在关键决策节点鼓励探索。

Conclusion: O4M-SP是一个有效的三维装箱问题解决方案，能够同时处理多种箱子尺寸和实际稳定性约束，在泛化能力和实际应用性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

Conclusion: Translution成功结合了自注意力和卷积的优势，在保持性能的同时通过α-Translution解决了参数过多的问题，在多个任务上表现优于自注意力。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

Conclusion: 目标性扩展和解耦优化对于高效稳健的领域自适应持续预训练至关重要，为CPT提供了新的原则。

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

Motivation: 循环注意力变换器在复杂推理任务中优于标准变换器，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索，需要从损失景观几何角度解释这一现象。

Method: 扩展河流-山谷景观模型，区分U形山谷和V形山谷，基于循环注意力的递归架构提出其具有向河流-V形山谷的景观级归纳偏置，并开发SHIFT分阶段训练框架。

Result: 理论推导证明循环注意力模型在损失收敛方面表现更好，能够学习更复杂的模式，SHIFT框架能够加速训练过程并达到可比性能。

Conclusion: 循环注意力变换器的优势源于其景观级归纳偏置，SHIFT框架为高效训练循环注意力模型提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

Motivation: 解释为何表达能力更强的GNNs通常具有更高的泛化误差，为表达能力和泛化之间的权衡提供理论解释。

Method: 通过WL着色算法分析，将表达能力和泛化性能联系起来，证明等价类数量与Rademacher复杂度的直接关系。

Result: 发现表达能力增加导致复杂度升高，从而削弱泛化保证；同时证明Rademacher复杂度在不同样本的着色计数扰动下具有稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了GNNs表达能力和泛化的研究，为理解表达能力增强往往以泛化性能为代价提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

### [387] [PANTHER: Generative Pretraining Beyond Language for Sequential User Behavior Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10102)
*Guilin Li,Yun Zhang,Xiuyuan Chen,Chengqi Li,Bo Wang,Linghe Kong,Wenjia Wang,Weiran Huang,Matthias Hwai Yong Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PANTHER是一个混合生成-判别框架，将生成式预训练扩展到用户行为建模，通过结构化标记化、序列模式识别和统一用户画像嵌入，在微信支付中实现了25.6%的下次交易预测提升和38.6%的欺诈检测召回率改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能封装广泛的世界知识，但在建模用户交互历史中的行为知识方面存在局限。用户行为构成一个独特模态，每个动作都包含时间、上下文等多维属性，建模这些高基数序列具有挑战性。

Method: 提出PANTHER框架：1) 结构化标记化将多维交易属性压缩为可解释词汇；2) 序列模式识别模块建模周期性交易模式；3) 统一用户画像嵌入融合静态人口统计和动态交易历史；4) 通过离线缓存预训练嵌入实现实时可扩展性。

Result: 在微信支付中完全部署，下次交易预测HitRate@1提升25.6%，欺诈检测召回率相对改进38.6%。在公共基准上的跨域评估显示强泛化能力，比transformer基线提升高达21%的HitRate@1。

Conclusion: PANTHER被确立为一个可扩展、高性能的工业级序列用户行为建模框架，成功将生成式预训练应用于用户行为领域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Lighter-X框架，通过压缩稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵，将GNN推荐系统的参数复杂度从O(n×d)降低到O(h×d)，显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统（如LightGCN）需要为每个节点维护大小为d的嵌入，参数复杂度为O(n×d)，在大规模图应用中面临可扩展性挑战。

Method: 分析原始结构和参数冗余，提出高效的压缩方案，包括稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵的压缩，采用解耦框架优化训练过程。

Result: 在大规模交互图上，仅使用LightGCN 1%的参数就能达到相当甚至更好的性能。

Conclusion: Lighter-X是一个高效且模块化的框架，能够显著减少参数大小和计算复杂度，同时保持理论保证和实证性能，实现大规模实际部署。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好驱动的知识蒸馏框架，结合LLMs和GNNs的优势进行少样本节点分类，通过GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器和节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器实现高效知识传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs依赖人工标注标签且难以处理复杂多样的局部拓扑结构，LLMs在少样本学习上表现良好但存在可扩展性问题，需要结合两者的互补优势。

Method: 使用GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器促进从LLMs到教师GNNs的预测蒸馏，以及节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器为每个节点识别最合适的教师GNN，实现从教师GNNs到学生GNN的定制化知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界文本属性图上的大量实验验证了该框架在少样本节点分类中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的偏好驱动知识蒸馏框架成功结合了LLMs和GNNs的互补优势，在少样本节点分类任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip是一个新颖的KV缓存重用框架，通过小辅助LLM指导的令牌选择和共享前缀等技术，在RAG系统中同时实现快速首令牌时间和高质量生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存重用方法在RAG场景下面临基本权衡：前缀缓存需要相同前缀但RAG中很少出现，直接预计算会因缺少跨块注意力和重复注意力下沉而牺牲质量。

Method: 集成三种技术：(1)辅助模型指导的令牌选择用于选择性KV缓存重计算，(2)共享前缀消除冗余注意力下沉，(3)分组策略在部分KV缓存更新时保持局部连贯性。

Result: 在NIAH和LongBench上分别保留94.8%和85.0%的全注意力性能，比APE和CacheBlend在NIAH上分别高出25.2%和35.1%，同时将LLM推理预填充时间加速达1.92倍。

Conclusion: CacheClip为RAG系统中的效率-质量权衡提供了实用解决方案，实现了快速首令牌时间和高质量生成的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通道置换方法依赖手工设计的质量指标，无法准确捕捉剪枝对模型性能的真实影响，需要更智能的优化方法。

Method: 提出可学习通道置换(LCP)，利用Sinkhorn归一化将离散置换矩阵转换为可微分的软置换矩阵；采用高效的块级通道置换策略减少可学习参数和计算复杂度。

Result: 在LLaMA系列、Qwen和OPT模型上的大量实验表明，PermLLM在优化N:M稀疏模型方面实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: PermLLM能够自适应优化通道置换，有效缓解剪枝引起的误差，为N:M稀疏模型提供了有效的后训练优化方案。

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究深度学习天气预报模型对对抗攻击的脆弱性，特别是在热带气旋轨迹预测中，上游预报的微小扰动可能改变下游轨迹预测结果。

Method: 提出Cyc-Attack方法：预训练可微分代理模型近似TC检测器输出；使用偏度感知损失函数和核膨胀策略解决类别不平衡；采用距离梯度加权和正则化确保物理一致性。

Conclusion: Cyc-Attack有效克服了传统攻击方法的局限性，为深度学习天气预报模型的安全性评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Conclusion: FIRE通过频域分解提供数学抽象，为不同类型时间序列实现可解释且鲁棒的预测，解决了现有方法的黑盒问题和理论理解不足的挑战。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for

embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

TL;DR: 统计哥德尔机（SGM）是首个用于递归自我修改的统计安全层，用统计置信度测试取代形式证明，在选定置信水平下认证改进后才允许修改，同时分配全局错误预算来限制累积风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归自我修改在AutoML、神经架构搜索和自适应优化中日益重要，但现有框架无法确保此类修改的安全性。哥德尔机虽然提供原则性保障，但在随机高维环境中形式证明不可行。

Method: SGM使用统计置信度测试（e值、Hoeffding界）替代证明要求，提出确认触发谐波支出（CTHS）方法，将支出索引到确认事件而非轮次，在保持族有效性的同时将错误预算集中在有希望的修改上。

Result: 在监督学习、强化学习和黑盒优化的实验中，SGM在CIFAR-100上认证了真实增益，在ImageNet-100上拒绝了虚假改进，并在RL和优化基准上展示了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SGM为学习系统中持续、风险感知的自我修改提供了基础性基础设施。

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式尺度卷积网络(PSCNet)，用于将低分辨率SMAP土壤水分产品与高时间分辨率ERA5-Land变量结合，实现时空降尺度，在青藏高原获得了10公里空间分辨率和3小时时间分辨率的无缝土壤水分产品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决土壤水分时空降尺度中由于地表辅助因子不完整导致的时间尺度反演困难问题，提高土壤水分监测的时空分辨率。

Method: 设计PSCNet网络，包含多频时间融合模块(MFTF)捕捉时间动态，以及定制的挤压激励(SE)块保留空间细节，结合ERA5-Land高时间分辨率变量进行降尺度处理。

Result: 在青藏高原验证中，PSCNet表现出最佳性能：卫星产品验证R值0.881，优于其他方法；站点验证R指标稳定前三；时间泛化验证相对误差控制在6%以内；时空动态和可视化验证显示优秀的时间敏感性和空间细节。

Conclusion: PSCNet通过有效建模土壤水分数据中复杂的时空关系，为时空降尺度提供了一个有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

TL;DR: MPPReasoner是一个用于分子性质预测的多模态大语言模型，结合分子图像和SMILES字符串，通过两阶段训练策略实现化学推理能力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有分子性质预测方法存在可解释性差、跨任务泛化能力弱、缺乏化学推理能力等问题，需要开发能提供化学洞察力的新方法。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct构建，整合分子图像和SMILES字符串；采用两阶段训练：使用16,000条高质量推理轨迹进行监督微调，然后通过基于原则的强化学习进行优化。

Result: 在8个数据集上的实验显示，MPPReasoner在分布内和分布外任务上分别比最佳基线方法提升7.91%和4.53%，表现出优异的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: MPPReasoner显著提升了分子性质预测的性能和可解释性，为化学家提供了有价值的化学推理路径，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor
cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities.
Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their
decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially
enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车辆路径问题的深度模型通常针对单一规模训练和评估，这严重限制了它们在不同问题规模间的泛化能力，阻碍了实际应用

Method: 设计任务间正则化方案保留小规模问题的知识，任务内正则化方案模仿最新期望行为，并利用经验回放机制回顾先前训练过的规模实例

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在各种问题规模上（包括训练中未见过的规模）都取得了显著优于现有深度模型的性能

Conclusion: 所提出的持续学习框架有效提升了车辆路径问题深度模型的泛化能力，关键设计组件展现出协同效应

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

*Nikolaus Salvatore,Hao Wang,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs在长上下文中出现"中间信息丢失"现象，这与人类记忆的首因效应和近因效应类似。研究发现这不是简单的信息丢失缺陷，而是预训练中不同信息检索需求适应的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在长上下文中性能下降的原因，理解"中间信息丢失"现象背后的机制，以及这与人类记忆模式的相似性。

Method: 从零开始训练GPT-2和Llama变体模型，使用模拟长时记忆和短时记忆需求的简单人类记忆范式，并扩展到序列补全任务。

Result: 发现U形性能曲线确实出现在训练中，近因效应与训练数据中的短时记忆需求直接对应，首因效应由均匀的长时记忆需求诱导，并受自回归特性和注意力汇形成的影响。

Conclusion: 信息检索需求、模型架构和训练过程中的结构注意力动态共同导致了LLMs中观察到的位置偏差。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

TL;DR: VivaBench是一个多轮临床推理基准测试，评估LLM在不确定性下的迭代诊断推理能力，发现当前模型在需要主动探索信息时性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基准测试主要评估知识回忆，而临床推理是假设驱动的迭代过程，需要从有限信息中逐步完善诊断。

Method: 构建1762个医生策划的临床小插曲，模拟医学培训中的口试场景，要求AI代理主动探查相关发现、选择适当检查并在多步骤中综合信息。

Result: 当前LLM在不确定性下进行迭代诊断推理时性能显著下降，识别出四种常见认知错误模式：初始假设固着、不当检查排序、过早诊断闭合、关键条件筛查失败。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估对话式医学AI系统提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前LLM在不确定性下推理和决策的根本局限性。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

TL;DR: ECHO是一个基于提示的框架，通过后见之明优化将强化学习中的后见之明经验回放技术应用于语言模型智能体，从失败的交互中生成优化的替代轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型智能体在新环境中部署时样本效率低下，这在交互成本高的环境中（如与人类交互或重置物理系统）严重阻碍了其实用性。现有架构虽然包含经验存储和反思机制，但未能充分利用语言模型生成或推理完整反事实轨迹的能力。

Method: ECHO包含两个组件：后见之明规则（使用语言模型识别相关子目标并生成优化轨迹）和更新规则（在内存中维护压缩的轨迹表示）。该框架从失败的尝试中为可实现的替代目标生成优化轨迹，从而从未成功的交互中创建合成正例。

Result: 在XMiniGrid（基于文本的导航和规划基准）和PeopleJoinQA（协作信息收集企业模拟）上的评估显示，ECHO比普通语言智能体基线性能提升高达80%；在XMiniGrid中，它还优于Reflexion和AWM等复杂智能体架构，通过更有效地利用过去经验实现了对新环境的更快适应。

Conclusion: ECHO框架通过后见之明优化显著提高了语言模型智能体的样本效率和适应性，证明了从失败交互中生成合成正例的有效性。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络在稠密图上效率低，常用的图稀疏化方法会丢失多尺度信息，需要一种能同时捕捉局部和长程交互的方法。

Method: 使用图元框架将图划分为不相交子图，通过异构消息传递架构学习多视图表示，该架构受非交换算子理论启发，具有更强的表达能力。

Result: 在分子性质预测和宇宙学参数推断两个科学领域的应用中，多视图图元模型比单图基线表现更好。

Conclusion: 多视图图元框架能有效捕捉多尺度交互信息，在科学计算应用中展现出优越性能和通用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

Motivation: 抗抑郁药物不依从现象普遍存在，导致复发、住院、自杀风险增加和巨额可避免成本。现有方法要么具有侵入性（血清检测、神经影像），要么基于代理指标且不准确（药片计数、药房续药）。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的模型分析来自消费级可穿戴设备或非接触式无线传感器的睡眠数据，推断抗抑郁药物的摄入情况。

Result: 在包含62,000个夜晚、超过20,000名参与者（1,800名抗抑郁药物使用者）的六个数据集中，该生物标志物实现了AUROC = 0.84，能够跨药物类别泛化，随剂量变化而扩展，并对伴随的精神药物保持稳健。纵向监测捕获了现实世界中的用药启动、减量和遗漏情况。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了客观、可扩展的依从性监测，具有改善抑郁症护理和预后的潜力。

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

Motivation: 多组均值估计与经典多臂赌博机不同，需要均匀准确估计所有组的均值，而非仅识别最佳臂。这使得探索无关算法既自然又有效。

Method: 使用Hanson-Wright不等式加强次高斯方差集中性结果，设计探索无关的非自适应和自适应算法，并扩展到上下文赌博机设置。

Result: 建立了比现有结果更紧的遗憾界，识别了严格次高斯分布类别提供更尖锐的保证，提出了利用侧信息的可证明保证算法。

Conclusion: 探索无关分配是多组均值估计的原则性高效方法，在实验设计、个性化等需要准确多组推断的领域有应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

TL;DR: NMF-LAB是一种新的监督学习方法，通过将分类问题重新定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，直接从协变量映射到标签，无需外部分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的非负矩阵分解方法是无监督的，无法直接利用类别标签。现有的监督扩展方法通常通过惩罚项或图约束来整合标签，但仍需要外部分类器。

Method: 将标签矩阵Y作为观测值进行因子分解，而协变量A作为给定的解释变量。这种方法直接产生从协变量到标签的概率映射，支持半监督学习，并能无缝整合基于核的相似性。

Result: 在从基准数据集到大规模MNIST数据集的各种实验中，NMF-LAB实现了有竞争力的预测准确性，对噪声或不完整标签具有鲁棒性，能够扩展到高维问题，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过在三因子NMF框架内统一回归和分类，NMF-LAB为现代分类任务提供了一种新颖、概率化和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

TL;DR: TreeDiff是一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的双空间扩散框架，用于可控图生成。它通过宏步扩展、双空间去噪和双空间验证器设计，在推理时实现高效可控的图生成，在分子生成基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图生成中缺乏对期望属性的控制，导致质量不稳定且难以融入新目标。推理时引导方法虽然无需重新训练，但本质上仍是局部、启发式且可控性有限。

Method: 提出TreeDiff框架：1）宏步扩展策略，将多个去噪更新分组为单次转移；2）双空间去噪机制，结合潜在空间高效去噪和图空间轻量离散校正；3）双空间验证器，从部分去噪图预测长期奖励。

Result: 在2D和3D分子生成基准测试中，无论无条件还是有条件设置，TreeDiff都实现了最先进性能。特别地，TreeDiff在推理时间扩展性方面表现优异：随着计算资源增加持续改进，而现有方法在有限资源下早期就达到平台期。

Conclusion: TreeDiff通过MCTS引导的双空间扩散框架，有效解决了图生成中的可控性问题，在保持计算可处理性的同时扩展了搜索空间，为可控图生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

*Sara Dragutinović,Andrew M. Saxe,Aaditya K. Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了transformer在上下文学习中的算法机制，发现在分类任务中transformer仍然通过梯度下降学习，但在核特征空间中进行，且softmax transformer具有上下文自适应学习率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解transformer如何仅通过输入提示中的示例学习新概念（上下文学习），现有理论研究主要基于简化假设，关注线性自注意力和连续回归任务，而transformer通常在离散复杂任务上训练，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 将现有理论研究扩展到分类设置，研究非线性（特别是softmax）激活的transformer，分析其在上下文学习中的算法机制。

Result: 发现transformer在分类任务中仍然通过梯度下降学习，但在核特征空间中进行，softmax transformer具有上下文自适应学习率，表现出更强的上下文适应性。

Conclusion: 这些理论发现增强了在更现实设置下理解上下文学习算法的理论基础，推动了我们对transformer学习机制的理解，并为向更大模型的理论延伸奠定了基础。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

TL;DR: HiLoMoE是一个分层LoRA MoE框架，通过参数高效的方式实现整体扩展，结合垂直和水平扩展的优势，在CTR预测任务中实现了更好的性能-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度模型在CTR预测中垂直扩展的序列计算效率问题，以及水平扩展的MoE方法难以捕捉推荐任务层次结构的问题，探索两种扩展方向的互补优势。

Method: 采用分层LoRA MoE框架，使用轻量级rank-1专家进行参数高效的水平扩展，堆叠多个MoE层实现层次化路由，基于前层分数而非输出进行并行路由，采用三阶段训练框架确保稳定优化和专家多样性。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，HiLoMoE实现了更好的性能-效率权衡，相比非MoE基线平均AUC提升0.20%，FLOPs减少18.5%。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE通过结合垂直和水平扩展的优势，在参数高效的方式下实现了整体扩展，为CTR预测任务提供了更好的性能-效率权衡解决方案。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多任务学习框架MTL-FSL，通过特征相似性拉普拉斯图来建模阿尔茨海默病数据中特征之间的时变相关性，提高了预测准确性和生物可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多任务学习框架未能考虑阿尔茨海默病纵向数据中特征相关性的时变特性，这限制了模型的预测性能和生物学解释能力。

Method: 提出了特征相似性拉普拉斯惩罚项来显式建模特征间的时变关系，同时考虑任务间的时间平滑性和特征间的动态相关性，使用ADMM算法求解非光滑优化问题。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验表明，MTL-FSL框架达到了最先进的性能，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: MTL-FSL框架通过建模特征间的时变相关性，显著提升了阿尔茨海默病预测的准确性和模型的可解释性，为神经退行性疾病研究提供了有效的计算工具。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

### [415] [Reverse Supervision at Scale: Exponential Search Meets the Economics of Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10446)
*Masoud Makrehchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了一种反向监督策略，证明即使计算速度大幅提升，机器学习仍然需要初始的人类监督来定义目标、类别和提供代表性标注样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在计算速度大幅提升（如量子计算或大规模并行硬件）的背景下，是否能够通过反向监督策略完全消除对人工标注的依赖。

Method: 分析了一种反向监督策略：在大型未标注数据集B上搜索标注方案，以最小化小型标注数据集A上的误差。搜索空间为2^n，复杂度呈指数级。

Result: 即使计算速度有常数倍的显著提升，也无法避免对信息性标注或先验知识的需求。机器学习流程仍然需要初始的人类贡献。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可以作为标签放大器，利用小规模人工标注核心进行扩展，但人类仍需保持监督作用。极端计算速度只能减少执行时间，不能减少学习的基本监督需求。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物运动模拟器在行为研究中具有重要价值，但现有方法难以在未知真实世界转移模型的情况下，既重现真实轨迹又支持奖励驱动的优化。多动物模拟中高自由度的运动特性使问题变得不适定。

Method: 使用深度强化学习和反事实模拟框架，将不完整转移模型中的运动变量估计为RL动作，并采用基于距离的伪奖励来对齐和比较网络空间与物理空间的状态。

Result: 在人工代理、果蝇、蝾螈和蚕蛾上的验证表明，该方法比标准模仿学习和RL方法具有更高的物种特定行为再现性和奖励获取能力，并能预测新实验环境中的反事实行为。

Conclusion: 该方法能够模拟和阐明复杂的多动物行为，支持多个体建模以实现灵活的假设轨迹生成，展示了在生物行为研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LightSAE的参数高效嵌入模块，通过共享-辅助嵌入框架分解嵌入为共享基础组件和通道特定辅助组件，利用低秩因子化和共享门控组件池来提升多变量时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多变量时间序列预测方法普遍使用共享嵌入层，对所有通道进行相同处理，造成表示瓶颈，掩盖了有价值的通道特定信息。

Method: 引入共享-辅助嵌入(SAE)框架，将嵌入分解为捕获共同模式的共享基础组件和建模独特偏差的通道特定辅助组件，并利用低秩因子化和共享门控组件池实现参数高效的LightSAE模块。

Result: 在9个物联网相关数据集和4个骨干架构上的广泛实验表明，LightSAE仅增加4.0%参数即可实现高达22.8%的MSE改进。

Conclusion: LightSAE通过有效建模通道特定信息，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测性能，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的部署受到内存和延迟瓶颈的限制，需要灵活的量化技术来平衡准确性和效率。现有方法需要支持多精度推理以适应不同的运行时约束。

Method: 提出AnyBCQ方法，将权重表示为带缩放因子的二进制位平面，支持位平面级计算和渐进精度扩展机制，同时设计了专用内核来支持动态精度选择。

Conclusion: AnyBCQ通过算法灵活性与硬件效率的对齐，为多精度LLM部署提供了实用基础，能够满足多样化的服务级别目标。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于锚点的最大差异(AMD)方法，用于相对相似性测试，通过同时学习假设和核函数来解决传统方法中核选择与假设指定顺序的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于核的相对相似性测试方法存在核选择与假设指定顺序的挑战：先指定假设后总能找到使假设被拒绝的核，这导致测试定义不明确。

Method: 提出AMD方法，在深度核空间中定义相对相似性为(U,P)和(U,Q)距离的最大差异。测试分为两个阶段：第一阶段估计AMD并推断潜在假设，第二阶段评估统计显著性。

Result: 通过理论验证和基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AMD方法能够同时学习假设和核函数，有效解决了相对相似性测试中的核选择问题，提供了统一的测试框架。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种梯度增强自训练PINN方法(gST-PINN)，通过基于梯度的伪点自学习算法解决传统PINNs精度有限、训练缓慢、缺乏标记数据等问题，在多个PDE问题上表现优于标准PINN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在求解偏微分方程时面临精度有限、训练动态缓慢、缺乏标记数据和多物理场交互处理不足等挑战，需要开发更有效的方法来克服这些问题。

Method: 提出梯度增强自训练PINN(gST-PINN)方法，引入基于梯度的伪点自学习算法，能够在不依赖标记数据的情况下有效求解PDEs，该方法泛化了PINN和梯度增强PINN(gPINN)。

Result: 在三个不同类型PDE问题上的测试表明，gST-PINN显著优于标准PINN。例如，Burgers方程的MSE达到10^-3量级，扩散-吸附方程达到10^-4量级，而gST-PINN继续下降至10^-5量级，表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: gST-PINN在所有情况下都优于标准PINN方法，即使在PDE解不可用的情况下也能有效工作，特别适用于容易出现低精度和收敛问题的场景，尤其是在缺乏标记数据的情况下。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著提升了LLM规划器的性能，在真实世界闭环基准测试中展示了更好的规划质量和人类相似性。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

Conclusion: f-influence框架为数据清理和模型行为归因提供了可靠的影响力估计工具，解决了现有方法的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics

Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 当前强化学习基准无法有效评估大语言模型的进展，作者提出Oracle性能差距指标和诊断套件来量化训练集与测试集性能差异，发现现有基准存在泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习基准无法可靠区分模型进展，因为训练集和测试集上的性能差异很小，无法反映真实的泛化能力。

Method: 引入诊断套件和Oracle性能差距(OPG)指标，通过压力测试分析模型在分布偏移、难度变化和反事实场景下的表现。

Result: 发现尽管基准分数很高，但现有RL方法在泛化方面存在严重问题，无法应对分布偏移和不同难度级别。

Conclusion: 当前基准不足以评估泛化能力，提出三个核心原则来设计更可靠的基准：足够难度、平衡评估和分布鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Motivation: 强化学习中数据的序列性质破坏了经典泛化界的独立性假设，需要克服这一挑战来获得有意义的泛化保证。

Method: 推导了考虑马尔可夫依赖性的PAC-Bayesian泛化界，开发了PB-SAC算法在训练过程中优化该界来指导探索。

Result: 该界为非策略算法如Soft Actor-Critic提供了非平凡的置信证书，在连续控制任务中保持了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为强化学习提供了实用的泛化保证，同时通过指导探索保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了MFAM模型，通过频率分解和多实例学习框架解决帕金森病严重程度评估中特征特异性不足和症状时间稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用时间序列模型缺乏病理特异性特征提取能力，且帕金森病症状的时间稀疏性导致关键诊断特征容易被传统聚合方法稀释。

Method: 使用频率分解模块增强特征特异性，引入基于注意力的多实例学习框架自适应聚焦最具诊断价值的稀疏片段。

Result: 在公开PADS数据集和私有数据集上的实验表明，MFAM在处理复杂临床时间序列方面优于通用时间序列模型。

Conclusion: MFAM为帕金森病严重程度的自动化评估提供了一个有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于共识的联邦和去中心化学习策略在存在异构本地数据或任务分布时统计上不是最优的，现有的多任务或个性化策略要么需要精确的任务关系先验知识，要么完全非参数化。

Method: 通过高斯马尔可夫随机场建模任务关系，使用未知精度矩阵，开发了一种联合学习任务关系和局部模型的策略，使智能体能够根据各自数据分布自组织。

Result: 理论分析量化了学习到的任务关系的质量，数值实验证明了该方法的实际有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在需要精确先验知识的参数化方法和完全非参数化方法之间取得了平衡，能够有效处理异构数据环境下的联邦学习问题。

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary
material.

### [431] [Compositional Symmetry as Compression: Lie Pseudogroup Structure in Algorithmic Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10586)
*Giulio Ruffini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于组合对称性的智能体建模框架，认为自然感官流可以通过有限参数李伪群在低维流形上的局部作用来描述，并证明了准确的世界跟踪会施加结构和动力学约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从算法（Kolmogorov）视角出发，智能体是使用生成程序来跟踪和压缩感官流的程序。论文旨在为深度模型中的组合性提供几何解释，并建立对称性在智能体建模中的理论基础。

Method: 将智能体建模为与感官流耦合的通用神经动力系统，分析世界跟踪对智能体施加的结构约束（本构方程和读出的等变性）和动力学约束（对称性诱导守恒量和低维不变流形）。

Result: 证明了对称性会导致智能体动力学中的守恒量（Noether风格标签），并将轨迹限制在低维不变流形上，这些流形在缓慢漂移时保持低维性，形成与伪群组合分解对齐的层次结构。

Conclusion: 提出了一个基于对称性的自包含预测编码版本，其中高层仅接收沿对称方向的粗粒度残差变换（预测误差坐标），为深度模型中的组合性提供了几何解释。

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

Method: 基于解耦表示学习和特征融合的EEG数据生成框架，通过特征匹配融合模块整合跨试验特征，结合轻量级特征提取和重建流程

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集上的实验表明，FusionGen显著优于现有增强技术，分类准确率有显著提升

Conclusion: FusionGen框架能有效解决EEG数据稀缺问题，提高脑机接口模型的泛化能力和实用性

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建学习模型时经常需要评估大量中间模型（如特征选择、模型结构搜索、参数调优等），这些中间模型的评估结果会影响后续模型探索决策。虽然先验知识可以提供初步质量估计，但真实性能只有在评估后才知道。

Method: 将中间模型探索问题形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的通用预算分配问题。

Result: 提出了一个理论框架来解决有限预算下如何最优分配资源来探索中间模型空间的问题。

Conclusion: 该工作为模型构建过程中的中间模型评估提供了一个形式化的预算分配框架，有助于在有限资源下做出更优的模型探索决策。

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

Conclusion: EDGAN模型在表达能力和简洁性之间取得了良好平衡，显著优于传统GAN变体，为股票价格预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Method: 提出SDG-L框架，结合LSTM特征提取器，专门设计用于更好地利用充放电过程中的辅助剖面信息，通过半参数深度高斯过程回归对时间序列电池状态数据进行建模。

Conclusion: SDG-L框架能够有效利用电池状态信息进行容量预测，在锂离子电池容量预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpMIA是一种基于神经网络隐式偏置的成员推理攻击方法，通过KKT最优性条件识别训练样本，无需依赖参考模型，在现实场景中优于传统黑盒和白盒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒成员推理攻击依赖不现实的假设：攻击者知道训练超参数、非训练样本与训练数据同分布、评估集中训练数据比例已知。这些假设在实际中很少成立，导致攻击性能显著下降。

Method: 利用神经网络的最大间隔隐式偏置理论，通过KKT最优性条件找到梯度最能重构模型参数的样本，从而识别训练样本。这是一种白盒攻击方法，需要访问模型权重。

Result: 在仅提供模型权重和训练数据超集的现实场景中，ImpMIA相比传统黑盒和白盒攻击方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ImpMIA通过利用神经网络的隐式偏置，摆脱了对参考模型和不现实假设的依赖，在现实成员推理攻击场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结合注意力机制的LSTM模型，用于提高孟加拉国温度和降雨预测精度。该模型在1901-2023年数据集上表现优异，优于XGBoost、简单LSTM和GRU等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 温度预测：测试MSE 0.2411，MAE 0.3860°C，R² 0.9834，NRMSE 0.0370；降雨预测：MSE 1283.67mm²，MAE 22.91mm，R² 0.9639，NRMSE 0.0354。在模拟气候趋势下MSE仅增加20%，区域变化下性能下降50%，均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该模型显著提高了预测精度，增强了对气候变化物理过程的理解，为孟加拉国气候敏感部门提供了有价值的预测工具。

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非线性上下文赌博机中的随机探索算法缺乏统一的理论框架，本文旨在建立集成采样作为可证明且实用的随机探索方法。

Method: 通过最大似然估计在随机扰动数据上维护多个奖励模型参数估计器，开发了GLM-ES和Neural-ES两种算法及其随时版本。

Result: 证明了GLM-ES的遗憾界为O(d^{3/2}√T + d^{9/2})，Neural-ES的遗憾界为O(˜d√T)，其中d是特征维度，˜d是神经正切核矩阵的有效维度。

Conclusion: 集成采样是非线性上下文赌博机中一种可证明且实用的随机探索方法，理论分析解决了非线性模型特有的挑战，实验验证了算法的强性能。

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs)方法，通过渐进式深度扩展训练策略，为不同复杂度的数据集找到最优网络深度，大幅减少模型大小和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常以全深度训练，但对于低复杂度数据集会造成计算浪费、能耗过高和内存占用过大，难以在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 采用类似NAS的渐进式深度扩展训练策略，从浅层网络开始训练，随着早期模块收敛逐步增加深度，直到达到目标精度，只保留最优深度。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度分别减少了98.64%和96.44%的内存占用，同时保持了99.31%和96.08%的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs方法能够根据数据集复杂度自动确定最优网络深度，显著降低训练和推理成本，提高计算效率，便于在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF微调扩散模型时训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题，提供了理论界限并通过实验验证高随机性SDE训练能缩小差距并提升ODE采样质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF微调扩散模型时，训练使用随机SDE采样器以鼓励探索，而推理使用确定性ODE采样器以提高效率和稳定性，这种不匹配导致奖励差距，引发对推理时输出质量的担忧。

Method: 采用广义去噪扩散隐式模型(gDDIM)框架支持任意高水平的随机性，保持数据边际分布；通过大规模文本到图像模型实验，使用DDPO和MixGRPO方法验证理论结果。

Result: 理论分析表明奖励差距存在非空界限，实验验证奖励差距在训练过程中持续缩小，使用更高随机性的SDE训练时ODE采样质量得到改善。

Conclusion: 训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距可通过理论分析量化，高随机性SDE训练能有效缩小该差距并提升推理时ODE采样的输出质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Conclusion: OmniGNN通过创新的行业节点设计和多关系动态建模，有效解决了宏观经济冲击下的消息传播问题，提升了股票预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个统一的优化框架，揭示了现有优化器之间的内在联系，并开发了具有竞争力的新方法，为深度学习优化提供了新的理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: BioOSS能够有效模拟神经处理中的波状传播动态，为生物启发的深度学习架构提供了新的方向

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在制度转换环境下，如何通过制度条件的生成场景和凸CVaR分配器来改善投资组合决策，特别是在危机期间更好地捕捉资产间的联动关系。

Method: 提出MARCD方法：(1)通过高斯隐马尔可夫模型推断潜在制度；(2)使用尾部加权目标和制度专业化混合专家去噪器训练扩散模型；(3)将生成场景输入考虑换手率的CVaR对偶二次规划进行分配。

Result: 在2005-2025年流动性多资产ETF的严格前向测试中，MARCD表现优于标准分配器，2020-2025年样本外测试中夏普比率1.23（基准1.02），最大回撤9.3%（基准14.1%），夏普提升在5%水平显著。

Conclusion: MARCD提供了一个从尾部忠实场景建模到受治理投资组合决策的可复现桥梁，显著改善了回撤控制，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the

Motivation: 由于隐私问题，数据提供者通常在共享前对数据集进行匿名化处理，但不同的掩码配置会产生不同效用的掩码数据集，因此需要高效确定最优掩码配置。

Method: 提出基于迭代比例拟合的联合分布估计器，利用有限数据摘要或无数据来估计特征-标签联合分布，支持多种特征-标签相关性量化方法。

Result: 实验评估显示，AEGIS识别最优掩码配置的速度比基线方法快一个数量级，且产生的掩码数据集在下游ML任务中达到与基线方法相当的预测性能。

Conclusion: AEGIS框架能够高效识别最优掩码配置，在保护隐私的同时保持数据集效用，适用于原始数据因隐私限制而无法访问的场景。

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了GLANCE框架，通过轻量级路由器选择性调用LLM来优化GNN预测，在异构节点上实现显著性能提升，同时保持整体性能最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-GNN融合策略在所有节点上统一应用，仅获得微小性能提升。作者认为这是因为聚合指标掩盖了LLM何时真正提供帮助，阻碍了新策略的开发。

Method: 提出GLANCE框架，使用轻量级路由器基于每个节点的廉价信号决定是否查询LLM。路由器通过优势目标训练，比较调用LLM与仅依赖GNN的效用。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GLANCE在节点子组间实现最佳性能平衡，在异构节点上获得显著提升（高达+13%），同时达到整体性能最优。

Conclusion: 研究强调了自适应、节点感知的GNN-LLM架构的价值，选择性调用LLM可在大型图上实现可扩展部署，而不会产生高计算成本。

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

Motivation: 连续状态扩散模型已有充分的理论研究，但离散状态扩散模型（在文本、序列和组合结构应用中至关重要）的理论理解严重不足，现有分析都假设了分数估计误差界限而没有研究样本复杂度。

Method: 提出了一个原则性的离散状态扩散理论框架，将分数估计误差分解为统计、近似、优化和裁剪四个组成部分。

Result: 获得了 $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ 的样本复杂度界限，证明了离散状态扩散模型的理论可处理性和实际相关性。

Conclusion: 该分析填补了文献中的基本空白，为离散状态扩散模型的高效训练提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习策略在单独训练时可能达到次优性能，因为缓存替换和预取策略之间存在双向依赖关系，需要联合训练。

Method: 提出了两种开发共享特征表示的方法：基于联合编码器的方法和基于对比学习的嵌入方法。

Result: 两种方法都展示了有前景的初步结果。

Conclusion: 为未来在这一方向的研究制定了议程，强调了联合训练缓存策略的重要性。

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Motivation: 发布机器学习模型时存在隐私泄露风险，需要一种原则性的方法来量化这种风险，并开发有效的防御机制。

Method: 基于信息泄露上界推导出梯度唯一性度量，并设计了一种基于监控梯度唯一性的简单防御方法。

Result: 该防御方法在隐私保护方面与经典方法DP-SGD相当，但在测试准确率方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性提供了一种直观的隐私审计方式，其数学推导具有普适性，为模型发布时的隐私保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Motivation: 现有基于VAE的时间序列异常检测方法存在单窗口特征限制和长期时频信息利用不足的问题，需要改进以提升检测性能。

Method: 提出LPCVAE模型：1) 使用LSTM捕获超越窗口的长期依赖关系；2) 采用Product-of-Experts机制进行自适应分布级概率融合，减轻时频信息损失。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将长期时间和频率表示与自适应融合相结合，为时间序列异常检测提供了稳健高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究表明，更强的模型并不总是最优的教师，存在教师输出与学生可学习性不匹配的问题。

Method: PerSyn采用"路由然后生成"范式：首先通过查询级路由器为每个提示分配最优教师，考虑学生可学习性和教师响应质量；然后各教师仅为分配的提示生成数据。

Result: 在不同模型系列和规模上的广泛实验表明，PerSyn在指令调优和数学推理设置中始终优于或与所有基线方法相当。

Conclusion: PerSyn验证了其有效性，并为未来研究提供了额外见解。

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理论框架，将经典信息论扩展到有限结构化系统，重新定义冗余为信息组织的基本属性而非低效。该框架将冗余表达为信息散度的统一家族，揭示了传统度量之间的几何联系，并预测冗余存在上下界，形成平衡压缩与耦合的最优均衡点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典通信理论强调最小化冗余以实现传输效率，但现实世界中的有限结构化系统（如机器学习）在冗余均衡点附近达到最大稳定性和泛化能力，需要重新理解冗余的作用。

Method: 构建理论框架，将冗余定义为信息散度的统一家族，统一互信息、卡方依赖性和谱冗余等经典度量。通过几何原理揭示这些度量间的内在联系，并理论推导冗余的上下界。

Result: 理论预测冗余存在最优均衡点，实验通过掩码自编码器验证了这一原理：模型在特定冗余水平下达到最佳泛化性能，表明冗余是可测量和可调的量。

Conclusion: 冗余作为可测量和可调的量，连接了通信的渐近世界和学习的有限世界，在有限结构化系统中扮演着平衡压缩与耦合的关键角色。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

Motivation: RLVR训练中常出现策略熵崩溃，导致策略过于确定性，阻碍探索并限制推理性能。传统熵正则化方法对固定系数敏感，在不同任务和模型间不稳定。

Method: 提出自适应熵正则化(AER)框架，包含三个组件：难度感知系数分配、初始锚定目标熵和动态全局系数调整，动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER始终优于基线方法，提高了推理准确性和探索能力。

Conclusion: AER通过自适应熵正则化有效解决了RLVR训练中的熵崩溃问题，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

Motivation: 解决MoE模型中专家模块带来的显著计算和内存开销问题，这些模块是模型大小和推理成本的主要贡献者。

Method: 提出PMQ（预加载混合精度量化）通过线性规划优化比特分配，平衡专家重要性和量化误差；OTP（在线任意剪枝）使用Gumbel-Softmax采样动态选择专家子集。

Result: 在DeepSeek-VL2上实现6.2倍权重减少，平均2.57比特，五个多模态基准测试中仅损失1.7%精度；OTP减少专家激活超过20%，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: MC#通过PMQ的静态比特宽度优化和OTP的动态路由相结合，实现了极端的压缩效果，为基于MoE的高效模型部署展示了强大潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应边界机制能有效提升奖励模型的性能，更好地将大语言模型与人类偏好对齐。

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

### [467] [Not All Bits Are Equal: Scale-Dependent Memory Optimization Strategies for Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10964)
*Junhyuck Kim,Ethan Ewer,Taehong Moon,Jongho Park,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 4-bit量化在非推理模型中是最佳选择，但在推理模型中失效，因为KV缓存会主导内存使用。研究发现存在规模依赖的权衡：小模型应优先模型容量，大模型应优先生成长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理模型与普通模型在内存优化策略上的差异，特别是4-bit量化在推理模型中的适用性问题。

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA-Diamond数据集上进行1700个推理场景的系统性实验，分析不同规模模型的内存分配策略。

Result: 发现8B参数是临界点：小于此规模的模型通过分配更多内存给权重获得更好精度，大于此规模的模型通过分配内存给更长生成长度获得更好精度。

Conclusion: 推理模型的部署优化需要与非推理模型完全不同的策略，内存优化不能是规模无关的。

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Blade是一种无导数贝叶斯反演方法，利用扩散模型作为数据驱动的先验，通过粒子群交互产生准确且校准良好的后验分布，适用于非线性前向模型的黑盒访问场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多科学和工程应用中，计算前向模型导数在计算和实际应用上都很困难，因此需要无导数的贝叶斯反演方法。

Method: Blade利用基于扩散模型的数据驱动先验，通过交互粒子群进行无导数贝叶斯反演，能够处理仅允许黑盒访问的非线性前向模型。

Result: 理论分析建立了非渐近收敛性，表征了前向模型和先验估计误差的影响。实证表明Blade在各种反问题（包括高度非线性流体动力学）上优于现有无导数贝叶斯反演方法。

Conclusion: Blade是一种有效的无导数贝叶斯反演方法，能够处理非线性黑盒前向模型，并在理论和实证上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种信息几何框架来量化表示效率，证明了Barlow Twins方法在特定假设下能达到最优表示效率（η=1）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习取得了显著成功，但缺乏统一的理论框架来理解和比较不同SSL范式的效率。

Method: 引入信息几何框架，定义表示效率η为学习表示空间的有效内在维度与环境维度的比率，有效维度来自编码器诱导的统计流形上Fisher信息矩阵的光谱特性。

Result: 理论分析证明Barlow Twins通过将表示的互相关矩阵推向单位矩阵，从而诱导各向同性的FIM，实现最优表示效率（η=1）。

Conclusion: 为理解Barlow Twins的有效性提供了严格的理论基础，并为分析SSL算法提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为不可转移示例（NEs）的训练无关、数据无关的输入侧使用控制机制，通过将输入重新编码到模型特定的低敏感子空间来保护数据，确保授权模型性能同时降低非授权模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么扰动数据使其不可学习，要么重新训练模型以抑制迁移，但都无法控制未知模型的推理，且通常需要控制训练过程。需要一种能在模型级别平衡效用与保护的机制。

Method: 将输入重新编码到模型特定的低敏感子空间，保持授权模型的输出同时通过子空间错位降低非授权模型的性能。使用Hoffman-Wielandt不等式将性能下降与谱差异联系起来。

Result: 经验证明，NEs在各种视觉骨干网络和最先进的视觉语言模型上保持性能，而非目标模型即使尝试重建也会性能崩溃。

Conclusion: NEs是一种实用的方法，既能保持预期数据效用，又能防止未经授权的利用，为数据保护提供了有效的输入侧控制机制。

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

TL;DR: InstructUE是一个基于指令感知的用户嵌入基础模型，使用多编码器架构和对比自回归训练框架，通过LLM生成通用且指令感知的用户表示，在用户预测、营销和推荐等场景中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户表示建模方法在跨领域泛化性和对噪声行为信号的敏感性方面存在不足，需要开发更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习模型。

Method: 提出多编码器架构处理六种异构数据源，采用对比自回归训练框架，结合自回归学习捕获语言空间知识，对比学习对齐用户-文本嵌入，增强指令感知和噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 在真实世界应用中，InstructUE在用户预测、营销和推荐等多个领域显著优于现有方法，能够有效实现特定场景下的指令引导去噪。

Conclusion: 指令感知的用户建模能够有效实现特定场景下的指令引导用户信息去噪，为更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

TL;DR: 提出了EasyCore框架，通过选择低平均输入梯度范数(AIGN)的“简单”样本来构建核心集，显著提升模型对抗性鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择算法主要关注清洁准确率，无法有效保持对抗性鲁棒性，需要从数据中心视角理解哪些样本对学习鲁棒特征最关键

Method: 将样本的对抗脆弱性与硬度联系起来，用训练过程中的平均输入梯度范数(AIGN)量化硬度，仅保留低AIGN的简单样本进行训练

Result: 在标准训练和TRADES对抗训练下，EasyCore相比现有核心集方法分别实现了7%和5%的对抗准确率提升

Conclusion: AIGN是模型无关的数据集属性，EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心方法，可显著改善对抗性鲁棒性

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的保形预测方法分别应用于多元时间序列和静态图，但要么忽略底层图拓扑，要么忽视时间动态性，需要开发能够同时处理图结构和时间动态的预测不确定性量化方法。

Method: 基于保形预测的顺序预测区域框架，利用图结构捕获节点间成对依赖关系，提供用户指定的覆盖保证。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，该框架保持期望的经验覆盖度，同时相比现有方法显著缩小预测区域（最多减少80%）。

Conclusion: 该框架为图时间序列提供了有效的预测不确定性量化方法，通过利用图结构显著提高了预测精度。

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成过程中会累积误差，特别是在应用任意引导来调整样本属性时，这会破坏样本保真度，出现离流形现象。

Method: 使用时间预测器估计每个时间步与期望数据流形的偏差，设计TAG引导机制在生成过程中将样本吸引回期望流形。

Result: TAG方法能在每个时间步产生与期望流形紧密对齐的样本，在各种下游任务中显著提高生成质量。

Conclusion: TAG是一种通用解决方案，能有效解决扩散模型中的离流形问题，提升生成样本的质量和保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Result: 在BIDMC数据集上实验表明，该方法对合成噪声和真实运动伪影具有强鲁棒性，优于传统滤波和现有神经模型

Conclusion: 该方法能有效恢复PPG信号同时保持心率准确性，展示了在可穿戴医疗系统中实际部署的潜力

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Motivation: 多智能体系统和强化学习能增强大语言模型的能力，但将在线策略强化学习应用于多智能体系统仍存在算法和系统层面的挑战，如标准GRPO分组假设失效和训练栈支持不足。

Method: AT-GRPO包括：(i) 针对多智能体系统定制的智能体和轮次分组强化学习算法；(ii) 支持单策略和多策略模型的训练系统。

Result: 在长期规划任务中，准确率从14.0-47.0%提升到96.0-99.5%；编码任务平均提升3.87-7.62%；数学任务平均提升9.0-17.93%。

Conclusion: AT-GRPO有效解决了多智能体系统中强化学习的挑战，在多个任务类型上取得了显著性能提升，证明了该方法的价值。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and

Motivation: 边缘设备计算资源有限且面临分布偏移，现有测试时自适应方法依赖梯度优化或批处理，不适合资源受限的边缘场景。梯度自由方法存在学习能力有限、缺乏灵活性或架构约束等问题。

Method: 使用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)在潜在主子空间进行前向坐标优化，通过更新紧凑的低维向量来增强输出置信度并使潜在表示更接近源潜在分布，模型参数保持冻结。

Conclusion: TED为边缘设备提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，在ZYNQ-7020平台上的成功部署证明了其在真实世界边缘应用中的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，CDRL4AD在准确性和根因分析方面优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 模型分析验证了超参数敏感性和时间复杂性，案例研究显示该方法能帮助人类专家诊断异常的根本原因

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

Result: 实验结果显示PhysioME在各种模态缺失场景下实现了高度一致性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: PhysioME有潜力成为支持临床决策的可靠工具，特别是在现实世界数据不完整的情况下。

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

Motivation: 挑战当前依赖大型通用LLM（如GPT-4）作为VRP问题启发式设计器的范式，证明经过精心微调的小型专用LLM可以生成超越专家设计的高性能组件。

Method: 提出RFTHGS框架，使用多层级课程奖励函数逐步引导LLM生成可编译、可执行且性能优越的交叉算子，并采用算子缓存机制防止抄袭和促进多样性。

Conclusion: 专用小型LLM经过适当微调可以超越大型通用模型和专家设计，为组合优化问题提供更高效的启发式设计解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such

TL;DR: 提出MLCM-KD框架，通过双向知识蒸馏解决热成像面部关键点检测中的模态差异问题，实现高效准确的热成像FLD模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像面部关键点检测在恶劣光照条件下很重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索。传统跨模态方法计算昂贵或产生结构伪影，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出多级跨模态知识蒸馏(MLCM-KD)框架，包含双向注入知识蒸馏(DIKD)，通过闭环监督强制学生学习与教师语义对齐的模态不变特征。

Result: 在公开热成像FLD基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于先前方法，同时大幅降低计算开销。

Conclusion: MLCM-KD框架成功解决了RGB与热成像数据之间的模态差距问题，实现了鲁棒且深刻的知识转移，为热成像面部关键点检测提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

Motivation: 模型性能在分布偏移下下降的主要原因是模型依赖与预测目标没有直接因果关系的特征。

Result: 在真实世界分布外基准测试中，TACT始终显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过因果修剪方法可以有效识别和去除非因果特征，显著提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Conclusion: 通过平衡核的多样性和个体测试功效，提出的方法显著提升了多核聚合测试的性能，为复杂结构化数据的核测试提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

Result: LSTM获得最佳性能（F1: 0.688，在81%数据集上排名前二），Informer提供竞争性精度（F1: 0.683）且训练速度快30%，经典方法在简单合成数据上完美预测但真实数据F1分数差2-3倍。预测质量主导检测性能。

Conclusion: 为复杂模式推荐LSTM，效率关键部署推荐Informer，资源受限的简单周期数据推荐经典方法，为基于预测的异常检测研究建立了基准。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

Conclusion: 学习算法是涌现计算的主要决定因素，基于奖励的优化能自主发现复杂动态机制，为设计自适应AI系统提供指导原则。

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

TL;DR: 提出了ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型进行纯低精度训练，解决了极端多标签分类中线性分类头计算和内存需求高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XMC方法主要依赖FP16-FP32混合精度训练，存在不稳定、内存使用效率低和计算开销大的问题，而现有低精度方法通常仍为分类层保留更高精度。

Method: 使用Kahan求和和随机舍入技术，结合梯度融合和分块内存优化，实现完全在Float8精度下训练XMC模型，无需单精度主权重或张量缩放。

Result: 成功训练了300万标签的XMC模型，仅需6.6 GiB GPU内存，相比优化SOTA方法Renee的39.7 GiB显著减少，且不损失准确率。

Conclusion: ELMO框架证明了XMC模型可以有效地完全在Float8精度下训练，大幅降低了GPU内存需求，为大规模多标签分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: EAGer是一种训练自由的生成方法，通过基于token熵分布的不确定性来减少冗余计算并提高性能，在复杂推理任务中实现最佳效率-性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同提示具有不同的复杂度，需要不同的计算量，但现有方法为每个提示分配相同的计算预算，导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 利用token-wise熵分布来评估模型不确定性，只在出现高熵token时分支到多个推理路径，并将节省的计算预算重新分配给最需要探索替代路径的实例。

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理基准测试中，EAGer无需访问目标标签即可重新分配预算，在推理长度和Pass@k方面实现最佳效率-性能权衡。当可访问目标标签时，相比Full Parallel Sampling生成少65%的token，Pass@k提升37%。

Conclusion: EAGer通过基于不确定性的计算资源动态分配，有效减少了冗余计算并提升了模型性能，为推理语言模型提供了高效的计算预算管理方案。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned

when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized

Motivation: 现有机器学习漏洞检测模型只能标记整个源代码函数为易受攻击，而无法精确定位具体漏洞代码行。检测粒度对软件开发中的人类操作至关重要，需要确保预测反映真实代码语义以帮助调试和修复漏洞。

Method: 提出了检测对齐(DA)方法，量化模型预测中最有影响的输入代码行与真实漏洞位置之间的一致性。该方法与模型无关，可适应不同的检测任务。

Result: 分析多个基于学习的漏洞检测器和数据集，发现这些模型的预测持续受到非易受攻击代码行的偏差影响，突显了偏差和伪相关性的高度影响。

Conclusion: 现有漏洞检测模型存在严重的偏差和伪相关问题，其预测往往受到非漏洞代码行的影响，需要通过检测对齐等方法进行更严格的评估。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,

Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

*Leonardo Di Nino,Gabriele D'Acunto,Sergio Barbarossa,Paolo Di Lorenzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大伪似然的结构化连接图学习(SCGL)算法，用于从观测信号中学习连接图的拓扑结构、边权重和几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接图通过将网络拓扑与正交变换耦合，能够表示全局几何一致性，在同步、黎曼信号处理和神经束扩散等应用中发挥关键作用。但如何直接从观测信号中学习连接图仍是一个挑战。

Method: 基于一致性假设的最大伪似然框架，强制连接拉普拉斯与底层组合拉普拉斯之间的谱特性联系。提出SCGL算法，在黎曼流形上进行块优化，联合推断网络拓扑、边权重和几何结构。

Result: 实验表明SCGL在拓扑恢复和几何保真度方面始终优于现有基线方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: SCGL为从信号数据中学习连接图提供了一个原则性框架，在多个性能指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速半监督图嵌入框架，通过联合优化结构保持、监督正则化和标签传播三个目标，在缺乏节点特征的图上实现高效节点分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实图中许多节点缺乏信息丰富的特征向量，仅能利用邻域连接性和类别标签，需要学习能捕捉结构角色和拓扑上下文的节点嵌入。

Method: 联合优化三个互补目标：可扩展模块化近似的无监督结构保持、最小化标记节点类内方差的监督正则化、基于随机游走和注意力加权相似度的半监督标签传播。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，分类准确率与最先进方法相当或更优，同时计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成高质量节点嵌入，在计算效率和分类性能方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据存在两个主要问题：标签数据稀缺和数据异构性导致的缺失值，这限制了机器学习方法在临床事件预测中的应用。

Method: 采用自监督自动编码器，利用无标签数据构建潜在空间，然后在该潜在空间上训练神经网络分类器来预测心血管死亡。

Result: 与直接将分类器应用于原始数据相比，该方法在平衡准确率方面表现更好，证明了该解决方案的潜力。

Conclusion: 自监督自动编码器是处理临床数据标签稀缺和异构性问题的有前景方法，特别是在无标签数据可用性可能增加的条件下。

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了异构数据场景下的客户端漂移问题，同时提升了全局模型的泛化能力和本地模型的个性化适应能力。

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ENIGMA是一种新颖的LLM训练方法，通过将组织政策视为信息流形上的方向，联合提升推理能力、对齐性和鲁棒性。该方法结合了GRPO、SAMI风格辅助损失和Sinkhorn正则化，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM训练中推理、对齐和鲁棒性通常被视为独立问题，但作者假设它们是单一信息几何目标的不同投影，希望通过统一的信息几何框架同时解决这些问题。

Method: 使用单循环训练器，结合：1) GRPO（基于策略的RL方法，仅使用CoT格式奖励）；2) SAMI风格的对称InfoNCE辅助损失；3) 隐藏状态分布的Sinkhorn最优传输正则化器。还引入了infoNCE指标来测量CoT编码策略的强度。

Result: 在1B参数LLM上的实验表明，高SI（充分性指数）原则预测了更稳定的训练动态和优于GRPO消融实验的基准性能。信息几何分析验证了流形中理想的结构变化。

Conclusion: ENIGMA支持了推理、对齐和鲁棒性是单一信息几何目标投影的假设，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理，为可信能力提供了路径。

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

TL;DR: ST-Vision-LLM是一个新颖的时空预测框架，将交通预测重新定义为视觉-语言融合问题，通过Vision-LLM视觉编码器处理历史交通矩阵序列，结合高效的数值编码方案和两阶段微调，在移动流量预测中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的时空交通预测对于密集城市移动网络的主动资源管理至关重要。虽然LLM在时间序列分析中表现出潜力，但难以建模基于网格的交通数据的复杂空间依赖性，且处理密集地理网格信息效率低下。

Method: 使用Vision-LLM视觉编码器处理历史全局交通矩阵作为图像序列；引入高效编码方案将浮点值表示为单令牌；采用两阶段微调：监督微调(SFT)和基于GRPO的强化学习优化。

Result: 在真实世界移动流量数据集上，ST-Vision-LLM在长期预测准确率上比现有方法提升15.6%，在跨域少样本场景中超过第二佳基线30.04%。

Conclusion: 该模型在各种数据稀缺环境中展现出强大的泛化能力，验证了将LLM扩展到时空预测领域的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LouisKV是一个高效的KV缓存检索框架，通过语义感知检索策略和细粒度管理方案，在长序列场景中实现4.7倍加速，同时保持接近无损的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存检索方法在长序列场景中存在显著的内存开销问题，特别是在长输出推理场景中，由于逐令牌检索和粗粒度页面级KV管理，导致效率和准确性瓶颈。

Method: 基于关键KV具有强时间局部性和在输入提示与生成输出中呈现不同分布模式的观察，LouisKV引入了语义感知检索策略（仅在语义边界触发检索）和解耦的细粒度管理方案（为输入和输出序列定制差异化策略），并集成了Triton和CUDA内核优化来加速KV聚类和检索。

Result: 评估显示，LouisKV在多样化长序列任务（包括长输入短输出、短输入长输出和长输入长输出场景）中，相比最先进的KV检索方法实现了高达4.7倍的加速，同时保持接近无损的准确性。

Conclusion: LouisKV通过利用KV的时间局部性和分布特性，结合语义感知检索和细粒度管理，有效解决了长序列场景中KV缓存的内存和效率问题，为大型推理模型的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

Conclusion: DiffTSST是一个有效的时序数据风格迁移框架，在数据增强应用中具有实际价值，特别是在数据稀缺情况下能提升异常检测等任务的性能。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

Result: 在四个公共数据集上进行了广泛实验评估和分析

Conclusion: EVP可作为插件增强现有动态图学习方法利用历史事件知识的能力

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

Conclusion: ROLL Flash通过异步RL后训练显著提升了训练效率和资源利用率，为大规模语言模型的强化学习后训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

Motivation: 解决图神经网络在节点特征稀疏或包含敏感信息时的性能下降和隐私风险问题。

Method: 扩展传统特征传播，将可用特征划分为多个高斯噪声视图，每个视图通过图拓扑独立传播信息，然后聚合生成鲁棒的节点嵌入。

Result: 在多个图数据集上的实验表明，MFP在节点分类任务上优于现有基线方法，同时显著减少隐私泄露。

Conclusion: MFP为特征缺失或敏感的场景提供了一个有效且隐私感知的图学习框架，传播输出作为原始特征的替代插补而非重建，在保持效用的同时保护隐私。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

TL;DR: 本文首次从理论上分析了批大小对Adam优化器泛化性能的影响，发现在两层过参数化CNN上，小批量Adam能够达到接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本会收敛到较差的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要分析Adam的全批量版本，但这与实践中使用的随机版本存在根本差异。随机Adam即使使用极小学习率也不会收敛到全批量对应版本，因此需要研究批大小对Adam泛化性能的影响。

Method: 在两层过参数化卷积神经网络上理论分析Adam和AdamW的泛化性能，比较不同批大小和权重衰减参数的影响。

Result: 研究发现Adam和AdamW在适当权重衰减下都会收敛到较差的测试误差，但小批量版本能够达到接近零的测试误差。同时证明Adam的有效权重衰减界限比AdamW更小，解释了为什么Adam需要更敏感的权重衰减调参。

Conclusion: 批大小和权重衰减在Adam的泛化性能中起着关键作用，小批量训练能够显著改善Adam的泛化能力，而Adam比AdamW需要更精细的权重衰减调参。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在医学领域中的知识表示和处理机制，为医学任务中的微调、遗忘或去偏技术提供指导。

Method: 使用四种可解释性技术：UMAP投影中间激活、基于梯度的权重显著性、层切除/移除和激活修补，分析了五个LLM模型。

Result: 发现医学知识主要在模型前半部分层处理；年龄编码在中间层呈非线性且不连续；疾病进展表示在某些层呈非单调和循环；药物按医学专业而非作用机制聚类；某些模型中间层激活崩溃但最终层恢复。

Conclusion: 这些结果可为医学任务中微调、遗忘或去偏技术提供指导，建议在特定模型层应用这些技术。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

TL;DR: WearECG是一种基于变分自编码器的方法，可以从三个导联（II、V1、V5）重建十二导联心电图，解决了可穿戴设备因导联数量限制而无法全面检测心脏病理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 十二导联心电图是心脏诊断的临床金标准，但缺乏便携性限制了其连续和大规模使用。三导联系统虽然便携但无法检测未测量区域的心脏病理，因此需要开发能够从有限导联重建完整心电图的方法。

Method: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）架构，通过改进模型结构来更好地捕捉ECG信号的时空依赖性，从II、V1和V5三个导联重建十二导联心电图。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的实验表明，该方法生成的信号具有生理真实性和诊断价值，在下游任务中表现稳健，生成的信号在专家图灵测试中难以与真实信号区分。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了生成模型在心电图重建中的潜力，为可扩展、低成本的心脏筛查提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架来分析摊销学习方法，将现有方法分为参数化、隐式和显式三种机制，并针对大规模数据集处理能力不足的问题，提出了迭代摊销推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代学习系统越来越多地依赖摊销学习，但现有方法在如何编码和利用任务特定信息方面存在差异，且大多数方法难以扩展到大型数据集，因为它们在推理时处理任务数据的能力有限。

Method: 提出了一个统一框架，将摊销模型分为参数化、隐式和显式三种机制，并引入迭代摊销推理方法，通过小批量逐步优化解决方案，从随机优化中汲取灵感。

Result: 该框架将基于优化的元学习与LLMs等模型中的前向传递摊销连接起来，为通用任务适应提供了可扩展和可扩展的基础。

Conclusion: 迭代摊销推理方法为解决当前摊销学习方法在大规模数据集上的扩展性限制提供了有前景的解决方案，为通用任务适应建立了更强大的基础。

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了DFTopK，一种新颖的可微分Top-K算子，实现了最优的O(n)时间复杂度，避免了基于排序的方法中的梯度冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联排序在大规模信息检索系统中广泛使用，但Top-K算子不可微分，阻碍了端到端训练。现有方法存在目标不一致或梯度冲突的问题。

Method: 通过放松归一化约束，DFTopK获得了闭式解并避免了排序操作，实现了线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在RecFLow基准和工业系统上的实验表明，DFTopK显著提高了训练效率并实现了优越性能，在线A/B测试中带来了+1.77%的收入提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个将可微分Top-K算子引入推荐系统的工作，也是首个实现理论上最优线性时间复杂度的Top-K选择方法。

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整数AI推理在嵌入式系统中显著降低计算复杂度，但量化感知训练仍忽略了整数重缩放操作的影响，这是整数AI推理中硬件成本较高的操作。

Method: 提出后训练强量化重缩放乘数的方法，并引入重缩放感知训练，对超低比特宽度的重缩放乘数进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，即使重缩放器宽度减少8倍，通过最小增量重训练仍能保持完整精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的嵌入式系统实现了更节能、成本更低的AI推理。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在推理任务中，先进行下一个词预测预训练，再使用强化学习微调的训练范式为何有效。通过理论分析证明，在预测d位比特奇偶性的任务中，当长思维链序列稀少时，这种训练方法能使自回归模型泛化，而仅使用下一个词预测则需要极大统计或计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在推理领域的最新进展主要基于一个训练范式：先对大型语言模型进行下一个词预测预训练，然后用强化学习算法优化。本文旨在从理论上理解这种训练范式成功的原因和优化机制。

Method: 提出一个理论框架，研究从包含长短"思维链"序列的混合分布中学习。特别关注预测d位比特奇偶性的任务，分析强化学习如何利用增加的测试时计算（表现为更长的响应）来促进学习过程。在简化设置中，理论证明自回归线性模型遵循此训练方法能高效学习。

Result: 理论证明当长演示在数据混合中的比例不随输入维度d指数级减小时，自回归线性模型能高效学习预测d位比特的奇偶性。在Llama系列模型上的实验也验证了相同现象。

Conclusion: 强化学习在下一个词预测预训练后的微调中，通过利用更长的测试时响应，使模型能够从稀有的长思维链中学习复杂推理任务，而仅使用下一个词预测难以实现这种泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算法代码生成方面表现出色，但在前端开发中表现不佳，因为前端代码的正确性需要通过渲染像素和交互来判断。

Method: 使用多模态LLM作为视觉批评家，通过视觉反馈进行强化学习训练；引入强制优化规则确保改进；在推理时解耦批评家，运行轻量级自编辑循环。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，ReLook在视觉基础前端代码生成方面持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 代理感知、视觉奖励以及训练-推理解耦带来了显著优势，证明了该框架在前端代码生成中的有效性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

Conclusion: GTPs成功弥合了生成模型策略在离线强化学习中的速度-性能权衡，为生成策略提供了更清晰的设计空间。

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

Motivation: 多跳问题需要识别多个知识目标来合成答案，这对现有的RAG系统提出了新挑战。现有方法难以理解复杂语义结构的问题，且在检索多个信息目标时容易受到无关噪声的影响。

Method: 首先构建多信息级别知识图谱来建模不同信息级别，然后设计查询特定图神经网络进行表示学习，该网络采用层内/层间消息传递机制，并在每次消息传递中由查询引导信息聚合。此外还提出了两种合成数据生成策略来预训练网络。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在多跳场景下表现有效，特别是在高跳问题中改进可达33.8%。

Conclusion: 该图表示学习框架能够有效提升多跳问题检索的性能，特别是在处理复杂语义结构和减少噪声影响方面表现出色。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于扩散模型的决策聚焦学习方法，通过扩散模型表示不确定参数的分布，并用采样进行随机优化，在决策质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策聚焦学习方法通常依赖确定性点预测，无法充分捕捉现实环境中的随机性，需要更有效的概率建模方法。

Method: 使用扩散模型表示参数分布，通过重参数化技巧实现端到端训练；提出轻量级评分函数估计器，避免反向传播通过采样过程。

Result: 实验表明该扩散DFL方法在决策质量上持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为决策聚焦学习提供了有效的概率建模框架，提出的轻量级训练方法解决了计算效率问题。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合学习注意力因子和套利交易策略的框架，通过条件潜在因子识别相似资产和错误定价，在考虑交易成本后实现风险调整收益最大化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计套利方法通常分别处理因子识别和交易策略，无法在考虑交易成本的情况下最大化盈利能力。

Method: 使用注意力因子作为条件潜在因子，从企业特征嵌入中学习复杂交互；使用序列模型从因子残差组合中识别时间序列信号；联合估计因子和套利交易策略。

Result: 在24年美国最大股票上的样本外测试显示，注意力因子模型夏普比率超过4；考虑交易成本后夏普比率达到2.3。

Conclusion: 联合估计因子和交易策略对于最大化交易成本后的盈利能力至关重要；弱因子在套利交易中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

*Prasanna Mayilvahanan,Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo,Thaddäus Wiedemer,Wieland Brendel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文指出现有RL微调方法主要是在强化已有解题模式而非发现新方法，为此提出了MATH-B基准测试来挑战现有模型，推动探索驱动的RL方法发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在数学推理任务上主要是在优化已有解题模式而非发现新方法，这限制了RL的探索潜力。需要新的基准测试来推动真正的能力提升。

Method: 构建MATH-B基准测试，专门设计来击败常见开源模型（最高8B参数），即使在大规模采样预算下也难以解决。问题来源于DAPO-Math-17K和DeepScaleR数据集。

Result: 现有RL微调模型（如Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B和DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview）在MATH-B上表现很差，即使在pass@1024采样下也难以解决这些问题。

Conclusion: MATH-B基准测试能够有效评估RL方法是否真正提升了推理能力，有望推动探索驱动的RL方法发展，激发更深层次的推理能力。

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了动态测度传输的生成建模，特别关注由连接源和目标分布的随机过程诱导的流。论文提出了一个PDE特征来描述直线流（加速度为零的流），并完全刻画了仿射时间插值过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哪些随机过程能产生直线流，这种流的点加速度为零，可以用一阶方法精确积分，从而设计更容易积分的传输过程。

Method: 通过分析随机过程的条件期望和速度场，提出了一个简洁的PDE特征来描述直线性，该特征平衡了条件加速度和加权协方差张量的散度。

Result: 完全刻画了仿射时间插值过程，并证明直线性仅在确定性端点耦合下发生。推导了约束流几何的必要条件。

Conclusion: 为设计更容易积分的传输过程提供了广泛指导，通过理解直线流的条件来优化生成建模中的动态测度传输。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除前瞻偏差，确保预测模型仅基于历史可用信息进行训练，避免未来信息泄露导致的预测失真。

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

Result: 实验表明BGPO在数学问题求解、代码生成和规划任务中显著优于之前的dLLMs RL算法。

Conclusion: BGPO通过内存高效的RL算法设计，解决了扩散大语言模型RL训练中的关键挑战，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

*Jens Tuyls,Dylan J. Foster,Akshay Krishnamurthy,Jordan T. Ash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在语言模型强化学习中引入基于预训练模型隐藏状态的表示多样性奖励，通过刻意探索来发现新颖多样的行为，而非仅仅优化已有行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习技术主要关注优化模型已有能力，但缺乏对发现新行为的探索。研究旨在验证刻意探索的价值，以及预训练模型知识如何指导这种搜索。

Method: 使用基于预训练语言模型隐藏状态的简单、原则性表示多样性奖励，在推理时和后训练两个场景中实施探索策略。

Result: 表示多样性探索显著提高了多样性和pass@k率：推理时效率提升，Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct在几乎所有任务上验证器效率提升超过50%；后训练中，在AIME 2024上，Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct的pass@80达到GRPO的pass@256水平，测试时样本效率提升3倍。

Conclusion: 刻意探索结合正确的多样性概念，是实现超越简单优化的新行为发现的实际可行路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

TL;DR: 本文研究了乐观Hedge算法在两人零和博弈中的遗憾最优性，改进了现有遗憾分析，证明了社交和个体遗憾上界可达O(√log m log n)，并提供了匹配的算法相关下界，最后改进了最后迭代收敛率和动态遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乐观Hedge算法在强解耦学习动态中的遗憾最优性，特别是对动作数m和n的依赖关系是否最优，以改进现有遗憾分析并提供匹配的下界。

Method: 通过将遗憾上界表示为关于学习率和某些负项系数的优化问题，进行精细分析；提供算法相关的个体遗憾下界来证明上界的紧致性。

Result: 在已知对手动作数的强解耦设置下，社交和个体遗憾上界可改进为O(√log m log n)；证明了现有社交遗憾上界以及新的社交和个体遗憾上界对乐观Hedge算法是最优的；改进了最后迭代收敛率和动态遗憾。

Conclusion: 乐观Hedge算法在两人零和博弈中的社交遗憾上界是最优的，包括常数因子；基于这些结果改进了收敛率和动态遗憾，并提供了匹配的下界。

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

TL;DR: QeRL是一个量化增强的强化学习框架，通过NVFP4量化和LoRA技术加速LLM的RL训练，减少内存占用并提升探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习对LLM的推理能力至关重要，但其资源消耗大，需要大量GPU内存和长训练时间。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，引入自适应量化噪声机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声。

Result: 在rollout阶段实现1.5倍加速，首次在单张H100 80GB GPU上训练32B LLM，在GSM8K和MATH 500等数学基准上达到与全参数微调相当的性能。

Conclusion: QeRL为LLM的强化学习训练提供了一个高效且有效的框架。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出对抗性漏洞源于神经网络中的高效信息编码机制，特别是叠加现象（网络用更少的维度表示更多特征），攻击者可以利用特征间的干扰效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关于对抗性样本起源的根本问题，挑战了现有将其视为决策边界不规则性或非鲁棒特征敏感性的观点。

Method: 在精确控制叠加的合成环境中验证叠加足以产生对抗性漏洞，并在CIFAR-10上训练的ViT模型中验证这些发现。

Result: 证明对抗性扰动利用了叠加特征间的干扰，攻击模式可从特征排列中预测，解释了模型间攻击可迁移性和类特定漏洞模式。

Conclusion: 对抗性漏洞是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入的问题。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的摊销采样方法和基于粒子的方法各有局限，需要结合两者优势来更有效地从非归一化密度函数定义的分布中采样。

Method: 利用SMC与MaxEnt RL的连接，使用学习到的采样策略和价值函数定义提议核和扭曲函数，引入离策略RL训练程序，结合历史样本和退火重要性采样权重。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法成功结合了摊销采样和粒子方法的优势，提供了更稳定和有效的采样解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.
