### [1] [Splatography: Sparse multi-view dynamic Gaussian Splatting for filmmaking challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05152)
*Adrian Azzarelli,Nantheera Anantrasirichai,David R Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将可变形高斯泼溅分解为前景和背景组件的方法，通过稀疏掩码在稀疏相机配置下实现高质量动态3D重建，在模型尺寸减半的情况下PSNR提升高达3分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电影制作中预算限制导致的稀疏相机配置问题，现有方法在捕捉复杂动态特征时效果有限。

Method: 使用t=0时刻的稀疏掩码将规范高斯和变形场分解为前景和背景组件，分别用不同损失函数训练，前景学习颜色、位置和旋转变化，背景仅学习位置变化。

Result: 在3D和2.5D娱乐数据集上实现SotA结果，模型尺寸减半的情况下PSNR提升高达3分，并能生成包括透明和动态纹理的分割动态重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏相机配置下实现了高质量的动态3D重建，无需密集掩码监督即可生成分割的动态重建结果。

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

### [2] [IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727)
*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench是首个针对印度次大陆的大规模多模态基准测试，涵盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、MMT和VQA三个任务，共约5K图像和37K+问答对，评估了8个模型并揭示了当前VLMs在文化多样性环境中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数视觉语言模型评估基准都是西方中心的，缺乏对文化多样性和多语言环境的测试，需要创建针对印度次大陆的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 构建IndicVisionBench基准，涵盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、多模态机器翻译和视觉问答三个任务，覆盖13个文化相关主题，共约5K图像和37K+问答对。

Result: 评估了8个模型（从专有闭源系统到开源权重模型），发现当前VLMs在文化多样性环境中存在显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench通过关注文化多样性和多语言性，建立了一个可复现的评估框架，为更包容的多模态研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [3] [Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729)
*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识的异常检测方法，用于检测合成医学图像中的网络诱导形状伪影，通过两阶段框架（特征提取和隔离森林检测）在乳腺X光合成数据上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在解决机器学习模型训练数据稀缺方面很有前景，但缺乏质量评估可能导致引入伪影、失真和不真实特征，从而损害模型性能和临床实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：(i) 新颖的特征提取器，通过分析解剖边界角度梯度的每图像分布构建专门特征空间；(ii) 基于隔离森林的异常检测器。

Result: 在两个合成乳腺X光数据集上，该方法成功将伪影集中在最异常分区（第1百分位），AUC值分别为0.97和0.91。读者研究显示与人类读者平均一致率为66%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了合成数据的负责任使用，使开发者能够根据已知解剖约束评估合成图像，识别并解决特定问题以提高合成数据集整体质量。

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [4] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Condition Preference Optimization (CPO)方法，通过优化控制条件而非生成图像来提升文本到图像生成的精确控制能力，相比ControlNet++和DPO方法有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet++只优化低噪声时间步，忽略了高噪声时间步的贡献并引入近似误差；而DPO方法难以确保图像对只在可控性上存在差异。

Method: 构建获胜和失败的控制信号c^w和c^l，训练模型偏好c^w，这种方法称为条件偏好优化(CPO)，消除了混杂因素并提供低方差训练目标。

Result: CPO在多个控制类型上显著优于ControlNet++：分割错误率降低超10%，人体姿态错误率降低70-80%，边缘和深度图错误率持续降低2-5%。

Conclusion: CPO通过条件偏好优化有效提升了文本到图像生成的可控性，在理论和实验上都优于现有方法，且计算和存储需求更低。

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [5] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DARN（动态自适应正则化网络），一种新颖的解码器架构，通过动态调整正则化策略来解决卫星影像异质性挑战，在完整微调和高效适应两种模式下都取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型为地理空间分析提供了强大表示，但标准适应方法使用固定正则化策略的解码器，无法处理卫星影像的显著异质性。

Method: DARN包含三个关键创新：轻量级任务复杂度预测器、基于预测复杂度动态调整dropout率的自适应dropout调制、以及调节通道激活的动态容量门控。

Result: 在完整微调模式下，DARN在GeoBench基准上达到86.66% mIoU（比之前SOTA提升5.56个百分点）；在高效适应模式下，在Sen1Floods11上达到90.5% mIoU，并在OOD泛化、鲁棒性和少数类性能方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DARN为关键地理空间应用中利用基础模型提供了更智能、鲁棒和高效的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

*Shirin Ermis,Cesar Aybar,Lilli Freischem,Stella Girtsou,Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi,Emiliano Diaz Salas-Porras,Michael Eisinger,William Jones,Anna Jungbluth,Benoit Tremblay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于预训练-微调框架的新方法，从全球多卫星数据将2D卫星图像转换为3D云图，首次实现全球瞬时3D云图重建，特别针对强烈热带气旋的3D结构进行准确重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热带气旋预报面临挑战，主要由于探测TC结构的卫星观测有限，以及难以解析TC增强过程中涉及的云属性。现有机器学习方法局限于TC不常见区域，且对强烈风暴验证不足。

Method: 采用预训练-微调管道框架，利用全球覆盖的多卫星数据学习，将2D卫星图像转换为相关云属性的3D云图，并在定制TC数据集上评估性能。

Result: 首次创建全球瞬时3D云图，准确重建强烈风暴的3D结构。模型不仅扩展了可用卫星观测，还能在观测完全缺失时提供估计。

Conclusion: 该方法对于增进对TC增强过程的理解和改善预报至关重要，为TC研究提供了重要的3D结构信息。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EETnet，一种基于事件相机的眼动追踪卷积神经网络，能够在资源受限的微控制器上运行，包括分类和回归两种架构版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件相机的眼动追踪方案大多依赖强大GPU，无法在嵌入式设备上部署，需要开发能在微控制器上运行的轻量化解决方案。

Method: 设计EETnet卷积神经网络，使用纯事件数据，提出训练、评估和量化方法，开发分类模型（网格检测瞳孔）和回归模型（像素级操作）两种架构。

Result: 成功开发出能够在资源受限微控制器上运行的轻量化眼动追踪网络，并提供了完整的训练和量化流程。

Conclusion: EETnet证明了基于事件相机的眼动追踪可以在嵌入式设备上实现，为低功耗实时眼动追踪应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

### [8] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了3D高斯点编码器，一种基于学习3D高斯混合的显式逐点嵌入方法，相比传统PointNet等隐式表示，在速度和参数效率上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D识别任务中广泛使用的隐式表示（如PointNet）存在效率问题，而3D重建领域已证明从隐式表示转向显式表示（如高斯泼溅）的优势，因此希望将这种优势引入3D识别任务。

Method: 开发基于自然梯度和从PointNet蒸馏的优化技术，学习能够重建PointNet激活的高斯基函数；并扩展3D高斯泼溅的滤波技术来进一步加速编码器。

Result: 3D高斯点编码器比传统PointNet快2.7倍，内存减少46%，FLOPs减少88%；在Mamba3D中运行快1.27倍，内存和FLOPs分别减少42%和54%。

Conclusion: 3D高斯点编码器是一种轻量级高效的3D几何表示方法，能够在仅CPU设备上实现高帧率，为3D识别任务提供了新的显式表示方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了Cellpose生物医学图像分割模型中的数据冗余和跨域遗忘问题，提出了数据集量化策略来构建紧凑训练子集，发现仅需10%数据即可达到性能饱和，并通过选择性重放和域排序策略有效缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学图像分割模型中两个关键挑战：训练数据冗余程度和跨域迁移对模型保留能力的影响，旨在提高训练效率并减少灾难性遗忘。

Method: 使用数据集量化(DQ)策略构建紧凑训练子集，通过MAE嵌入和t-SNE进行潜在空间分析，进行跨域微调实验，并采用选择性DQ重放和训练域排序策略。

Result: 图像分割性能在仅使用10%数据时达到饱和；跨域微调导致源域性能显著下降；选择性重放5-10%源数据可有效恢复源性能；域排序改善泛化并减少遗忘。

Conclusion: 生物医学图像分割需要数据中心的优化设计，高效训练不仅需要紧凑子集，还需要保留感知的学习策略和明智的域排序。

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [10] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合主动学习和伪标签的数据中心AI工作流，通过利用基础模型生成伪标签来配置nnU-Net，然后选择代表性样本进行最小化人工标注，显著减少标注需求的同时保持竞争力性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学图像分割中标注数据稀缺的问题，传统方法对噪声数据敏感，nnU-Net需要大量标注数据进行交叉验证，而大型基础模型在特定数据集上可能表现不佳。

Method: 使用基础模型生成伪标签来配置nnU-Net，然后通过主动学习选择代表性核心集进行最小人工标注，最后对nnU-Net进行微调。

Result: 该方法显著减少了人工标注的需求，同时保持了竞争力的分割性能。

Conclusion: 为生物医学研究人员提供了一个可访问的解决方案，能够在分割任务中应用最先进的AI技术，同时最小化人工干预。

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于表面法向量先验知识的几何去噪新范式，通过标签向量集进行自然分割，采用总变差正则化和分裂Bregman方法求解优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用表面法向量的先验知识来改进几何去噪，通过标签向量集提供方向偏好，并在去噪过程中自然嵌入分割功能。

Method: 使用标签向量集作为法向量先验，构建包含总变差正则化的优化问题，采用分裂Bregman（ADMM）方法求解，顶点更新基于二阶形状微积分。

Result: 该方法能够同时实现几何去噪和基于法向量相似性的表面分割，通过正则化保持几何结构的平滑性。

Conclusion: 提出的新范式成功地将法向量先验知识与几何去噪相结合，在去噪过程中自然地实现了表面分割，为几何处理提供了有效的新方法。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

*Kyle Fogarty,Chenyue Cai,Jing Yang,Zhilin Guo,Cengiz Öztireli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从点云中学习形状特定先验的隐式自先验方法，通过联合训练可学习嵌入字典与隐式距离场，无需外部训练数据即可生成高质量表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从不规则点云恢复高质量表面是病态问题，需要强几何先验。传统方法依赖外部训练数据，而本文直接从输入点云本身提取先验信息。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制让隐式距离场关注可学习嵌入字典，捕获形状的重复结构和长程相关性。通过自监督点云重建损失优化，然后采样生成密集点云和法向量，最后集成到稳健隐式移动最小二乘法中。

Result: 实验表明该方法在生成高保真表面方面优于传统和基于学习的方法，具有更好的细节保持能力和对数据退化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种混合策略有效结合了学习先验和输入保真度，能够在稀疏区域进行正则化的同时保留精细几何细节。

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Clinical-ComBAT方法，用于解决DW-MRI数据在多站点采集时的扫描仪偏差问题，相比传统ComBAT方法更适合临床场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ComBAT方法依赖线性协变量关系、同质人群、固定站点数量和充足数据，限制了其在临床环境中的应用。需要一种能够灵活适应新数据和新站点、处理小样本队列的临床级数据协调方法。

Method: Clinical-ComBAT采用非线性多项式数据模型，以规范站点为参考进行站点特异性协调，包含可适应小队列的方差先验、超参数调优和协调效果评估指标。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上的实验表明，该方法能有效改善扩散指标的匹配度，增强规范建模的适用性。

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT为多站点DW-MRI数据协调提供了一种临床适用的解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

*James Ndubuisi,Fernando Auat,Marta Vallejo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了Swin视觉变换器模型在耳科疾病诊断中的效果，发现初始结果虽好但存在数据泄露问题，修正后准确率显著下降，强调数据预处理的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于耳鼻喉科专家存在27%的误诊率，需要提高耳科疾病的诊断准确性，因此探索视觉变换器模型在医学图像诊断中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用智利大学临床医院耳鼻喉科的真实耳镜视频数据集，基于拉普拉斯和香农熵阈值选择帧并去除空白帧，比较Swin v1、Swin v2变换器模型与ResNet模型的性能。

Result: 初始结果：Swin v1准确率100%，Swin v2准确率99.1%，ResNet准确率99.5%。发现数据泄露问题后修正结果：Swin v1和Swin v2准确率83%，ResNet准确率82%。

Conclusion: 视觉变换器模型在耳科疾病诊断中具有潜力，但必须在先进模型架构与有效数据预处理之间找到最佳平衡，这对开发可靠的医疗机器学习模型至关重要。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

*Ahmad Elallaf,Nathan Jacobs,Xinyue Ye,Mei Chen,Gongbo Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卫星影像的地理空间深度学习框架，用于预测致命交通事故风险，通过Beta概率分布提供不确定性感知预测，在召回率上比基线方法提升17-23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通安全研究孤立分析风险因素，忽略了建成环境的空间复杂性；传统神经网络风险估计器仅提供点估计，缺乏模型不确定性信息，限制了在关键决策中的应用价值。

Method: 利用卫星影像作为综合空间输入，开发地理空间深度学习框架，模型估计致命碰撞风险的完整Beta概率分布，而非单一确定性输出。

Result: 模型在召回率关键指标上比基线方法提升17-23%，同时提供更优的校准性能，能够从卫星影像单独提供可靠且可解释的风险评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供更安全的导航支持，并为城市规划者和政策制定者提供高度可扩展的工具，以公平且经济高效的方式提升道路安全。

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IMDNet网络，通过解耦多退化成分来指导路径选择，实现多退化图像恢复，在保持单退化任务竞争力的同时，在多退化恢复上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像往往同时存在多种退化（如雨、噪声、雾霾），而现有方法大多只针对单一退化类型，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 设计退化成分解耦块（DIDBlock）在编码器中分离退化成分，融合块（FBlock）整合多层级退化信息，任务适应块（TABlock）在解码器中动态激活或融合功能分支。

Result: 在多个退化场景下验证，IMDNet在多退化图像恢复上表现优越，同时在单退化任务上保持强竞争力。

Conclusion: IMDNet通过紧密集成的架构有效解决了多退化图像恢复问题，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高维潜在空间表示和多智能体对抗强化学习(MAARL)的深度学习框架，用于开发鲁棒且自适应的水印方法，以解决深度伪造检测中的泛化性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的快速发展导致深度伪造日益逼真，现有被动检测器依赖特定伪造伪影而泛化能力有限，主动水印检测方法难以平衡对抗良性失真和恶意篡改的敏感性。

Method: 开发了在潜在空间中操作的可学习水印嵌入器，捕获高级图像语义；采用MAARL范式，通过水印智能体与对抗攻击智能体模拟的良性/恶意图像操作动态课程进行交互，寻求鲁棒性与脆弱性的最优平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架通过高维潜在空间表示和MAARL范式，成功开发了鲁棒且自适应的水印方法，有效解决了深度伪造检测中的泛化性挑战。

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

TL;DR: CLM系统通过在CPU和GPU内存之间智能调度高斯分布，使3D高斯泼溅技术能够在单个消费级GPU上渲染大规模场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然渲染速度快、质量高，但处理大规模场景时内存需求过大，超出大多数GPU的内存容量。

Method: 将高斯分布卸载到CPU内存，仅在需要时加载到GPU；利用内存访问模式进行流水线化以重叠通信和计算；减少通信量。

Result: 能够在单个RTX4090上渲染需要1亿个高斯分布的大规模场景，并达到最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: CLM系统成功解决了3D高斯泼溅技术的内存限制问题，使其能够在消费级硬件上处理大规模场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 提出PDS方法解决fMRI和dMRI模态缺失问题，通过模式感知双模态3D扩散框架和微结构细化网络，在多个数据集上实现最先进的合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI和dMRI在神经退行性疾病研究中至关重要，但模态缺失限制了其临床应用。现有方法在fMRI-dMRI合成中面临BOLD信号与扩散加权信号的显著差异，以及疾病相关神经解剖模式整合不足的问题。

Method: 提出PDS方法，包含：(1) 模式感知双模态3D扩散框架用于跨模态学习；(2) 集成高效微结构细化的组织细化网络，以保持结构保真度和精细细节。

Result: 在OASIS-3、ADNI和内部数据集上评估，fMRI合成PSNR/SSIM为29.83 dB/90.84%，dMRI合成PSNR/SSIM为30.00 dB/77.55%，均优于基线方法。临床验证中，合成数据在NC vs MCI vs AD分类中达到67.92%/66.02%/64.15%的准确率。

Conclusion: PDS方法有效解决了fMRI-dMRI模态合成中的挑战，在合成质量和临床诊断性能方面均表现出色，为神经退行性疾病研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个端到端的可微分框架，通过傅里叶级数参数化任意形状，使用绕数映射将形状转换为DNN所需的像素网格，并利用信号能量约束优化几何形状，从而探索深度神经网络的几何理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络研究主要关注纹理特征，而对几何形状的理解研究不足。本文旨在探索形状作为语义载体的潜力，将其作为解释性工具和对抗性攻击手段。

Method: 开发了一个端到端的可微分框架，包含：1）傅里叶级数参数化任意形状；2）基于绕数的映射方法将形状转换为像素网格；3）信号能量约束确保物理上合理的形状并提高优化效率。

Result: 优化的形状能够：1）作为有效的语义载体，仅通过几何特征产生高置信度分类；2）作为高保真解释工具，精确识别模型的关键区域；3）构成新的通用对抗性范式，欺骗下游视觉任务。

Conclusion: 该工作为探索DNN的几何世界提供了一个多功能框架，并为挑战和理解机器感知开辟了新前沿。

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

Conclusion: 通过发布Triple-S和GSE，为贴纸理解、检索和多模态内容生成提供了标准化评估工具和鲁棒嵌入表示。

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are

TL;DR: 该论文发现现有LVLM架构存在语言模态偏见，并提出通过视觉特征平均池化来优化文本嵌入的方法，显著改善了视觉定位并减少了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别主流LVLM架构中存在的语言模态偏见问题，这种偏见主要源于将视觉嵌入简单附加到输入文本序列的常见做法，导致模型过度依赖语言信息而忽视视觉内容。

Method: 提出一种简单有效的方法，通过整合平均池化的视觉特征来优化文本嵌入，从而平衡多模态表示中的模态权重。

Result: 该方法在标准基准测试中显著改善了视觉定位能力，并大幅减少了幻觉现象，证明了视觉信息整合对缓解模态不平衡的有效性。

Conclusion: 虽然平均池化提供了一种简单、鲁棒且高效的视觉信息整合方式，但更复杂的融合策略可能进一步改善视觉定位和跨模态对齐，这为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

<details>

Motivation: 训练端到端的WSI表示模型面临重大挑战，因为标准十亿像素切片包含数万个图像块，受GPU限制无法在单个小批量中计算所有块的梯度。

Method: 使用内存库存储所有WSI中图像块的特征。训练时对每个WSI随机采样部分块计算特征，同时从内存库选择同一切片的额外块特征，通过残差编码技术结合采样特征和检索特征生成WSI表示，最后基于小批量内WSI的表示和病理报告计算切片级对比损失。

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL方法通过动态残差编码和切片级对比学习，成功实现了WSI的端到端表示学习，在多个病理分析任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Motivation: 解决传统运动捕捉需要专门设备（如摄像头、可穿戴设备）的限制，为隐私保护、低光照和低成本场景提供解决方案。由于压力信号到全身运动的不确定性，这是一个严重不适定问题。

Method: 提出Pressure2Motion生成模型，利用压力特征作为输入，文本提示作为高级约束。采用双级特征提取器准确解释压力数据，以及分层扩散模型识别大尺度运动轨迹和细微姿态调整。

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion是首个同时利用压力数据和语言先验进行运动生成的开创性工作，代码和基准将在发表后公开。

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

TL;DR: NTP-MRISeg将医学参考图像分割重新定义为基于统一多模态序列的自回归下一个标记预测任务，简化了模型设计并实现了端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学参考图像分割方法通常涉及复杂的多模态融合或多阶段解码器设计，作者希望提出更简化的统一框架。

Method: 将MRIS重新定义为自回归下一个标记预测任务，使用统一的多模态序列（图像、文本和掩码标记），并提出Next-k Token Prediction、Token-level Contrastive Learning和Hard Error Token优化策略。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19和MosMedData+数据集上的广泛实验表明，NTP-MRISeg达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg为传统MRIS流程提供了一个简化和有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PITTA的新型单目深度估计测试时自适应框架，通过姿态无关的自适应范式和实例感知图像掩码策略，在无需相机姿态信息的情况下显著提升了在动态环境中的深度估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目深度估计的测试时自适应方法在多样化和动态环境中效果不佳，需要一种能够在不依赖相机姿态信息的情况下有效适应不同环境条件的解决方案。

Method: PITTA框架包含两个关键创新策略：(1)姿态无关的测试时自适应范式，无需相机姿态信息；(2)实例感知图像掩码，通过预训练的泛化分割网络提取动态对象的实例级掩码，移除静态背景。还提出了有效的边缘提取方法。

Result: 在DrivingStereo和Waymo数据集上的广泛实验表明，PITTA框架在多种环境条件下显著超越了现有的最先进技术，在测试时自适应过程中取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PITTA通过姿态无关的自适应范式和实例感知掩码策略，为单目深度估计的测试时自适应提供了一个高效且实用的解决方案，在动态环境中表现出卓越的性能。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP是一个新颖的数据合成框架，通过多视角角色扮演提示引导多模态大语言模型生成语义多样化的图像描述，提升CLIP模型的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法主要关注增加数据量，但往往导致语义多样性有限和描述冗余浅显，需要提升合成数据的语义质量和多样性。

Method: 使用多视角角色扮演提示（如组合分析师、图像上下文解释者等）引导MLLMs从不同视角生成语义多样化的图像描述，增强图像-文本对齐的细粒度表达。

Result: 仅用100万Role-SynthCLIP对训练的CLIP-B/16模型在MS COCO验证集上达到64.1%的Recall@1，比现有最佳合成数据基线（500万对）高出2.8个百分点。

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP通过多视角角色提示机制有效提升了合成数据的语义多样性和质量，在保持数据量不变的情况下显著提升了CLIP模型的性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜手术中组织烧灼产生的烟雾会显著降低内窥镜图像质量，增加手术错误风险，阻碍临床决策和计算机视觉分析。

Method: SurgiATM统计性地桥接基于物理的大气模型和数据驱动的深度学习模型，结合前者的泛化能力和后者的高精度，设计为轻量级即插即用模块。

Result: 在三个公共手术数据集上的实验表明，集成SurgiATM能普遍降低现有模型的恢复误差，相对提升泛化能力，且不增加可训练层或权重。

Conclusion: SurgiATM具有便利性、低成本、有效性和泛化性，能无缝集成到各种手术去烟架构中，更好地满足临床需求。

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at
https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解对抗样本与干净样本的内在差异对于增强DNN鲁棒性和对抗攻击检测至关重要。

Method: 使用9种典型攻击生成对抗样本，引入滑动掩码置信熵(SMCE)量化遮挡下的模型置信度波动，提出滑动窗口掩码对抗样本检测(SWM-AED)方法。

Result: 对抗样本在遮挡下的置信度波动显著高于原始样本，SWM-AED在CIFAR-10上多数情况下准确率超过62%，最高达96.5%。

Conclusion: 基于遮挡敏感性的检测方法能有效识别对抗样本，避免了传统对抗训练的灾难性过拟合问题。

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

Motivation: 解决现有虚拟数据集构建复杂、领域泛化能力差的问题，为保护数据隐私提供有效的虚拟数据替代方案。

Method: 第一阶段：使用多维度属性提示驱动扩散模型生成大规模虚拟数据集GenePerson；第二阶段：通过提示驱动的解耦机制，利用对比学习和文本反转网络分离风格和内容特征，学习领域不变内容特征。

Result: 在GenePerson数据集上训练的模型（包含130,519张图像、6,641个身份）实现了最先进的泛化性能，超越了在真实和虚拟Re-ID数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: DPPP范式能够有效解决虚拟数据集的构建和泛化问题，为隐私保护下的行人重识别提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

Motivation: 恶劣天气严重损害真实世界的视觉感知，而现有基于固定参数合成数据训练的视觉模型难以泛化到复杂的退化情况。

Method: 首先构建物理驱动的高保真数据集HFLS-Weather，然后设计双层次强化学习框架：局部层次通过扰动驱动的图像质量优化精炼天气特定恢复模型，实现无配对监督的奖励学习；全局层次使用元控制器根据场景退化动态编排模型选择和执行顺序。

Conclusion: 提出的双层次强化学习框架通过物理驱动数据集和动态模型编排，有效解决了恶劣天气下视觉感知的泛化问题。

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜层厚度变化与神经退行性疾病相关，但以往研究主要关注分割层厚度测量。本研究探索直接对OCT B扫描图像进行分类，实现阿尔茨海默病的早期检测。

Method: 微调多个预训练模型（包括ImageNet网络和OCT专用RETFound transformer），使用UK Biobank队列中年龄、性别和成像实例匹配的数据集，应用标准及OCT专用数据增强技术，采用年加权损失函数优先考虑成像后4年内诊断的病例。

Result: ResNet-34产生最稳定结果，在4年队列中AUC达到0.62。可解释性分析确认了AD组与对照组在中央黄斑亚区存在局部结构差异。

Conclusion: 虽然结果低于临床应用阈值，但为OCT-based AD预测提供了基线，突出了在AD诊断前数年检测细微视网膜生物标志物的挑战，并指出需要更大数据集和多模态方法。

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

Method: 提出BRIXEL知识蒸馏方法，让学生模型学习在更高分辨率下重现自身特征图。

Result: 在固定分辨率的下游任务中大幅超越基线DINOv3模型，能以更低的计算成本生成与教师模型相似的特征图。

Conclusion: BRIXEL通过简单的知识蒸馏方法有效解决了高分辨率特征图计算成本高的问题，在性能和效率上都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code

Conclusion: MUSE有效解决了组织病理学核检测与分类的核心挑战，能够充分利用无标注病理图像的价值。

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Conclusion: 4D3R框架在动态场景渲染中实现了更好的性能和效率平衡，为未知相机位姿的动态场景新视角合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

TL;DR: FreeControl是一个无需训练的扩散模型控制框架，通过单步注意力提取和潜在条件解耦实现高效的结构和语义控制，支持组合控制，推理成本仅增加约5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型控制方法如ControlNet依赖手工条件图和重新训练，灵活性有限；基于反转的方法对齐效果好但推理成本高。需要一种无需训练、高效且灵活的控制方法。

Method: 1. 单步注意力提取：从最优关键时间步提取注意力并重用于整个去噪过程；2. 潜在条件解耦(LCD)：分离关键时间步和噪声潜在，提供更精细的注意力质量控制；3. 支持组合控制：通过多源参考图像实现场景布局设计。

Result: FreeControl实现了结构和语义对齐的视觉连贯生成，直接从原始图像生成，支持直观的组合设计，与现代扩散模型兼容，推理成本仅增加约5%。

Conclusion: FreeControl为测试时控制引入了新范式，无需训练或反转即可实现高效、灵活的结构和语义控制，在保持高质量的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

narrative structure, character prominence, and story progression in anime. In
this work, we introduce OregairuChar, a benchmark dataset designed for
appearance frequency analysis in the anime series My Teen Romantic Comedy
SNAFU. The dataset comprises 1600 manually selected frames from the third

OregairuChar captures diverse visual challenges, including occlusion, pose
variation, and inter-character similarity, providing a realistic basis for
appearance-based studies. To enable quantitative research, we benchmark several
object detection models on the dataset and leverage their predictions for
fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This
approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within
the narrative. By emphasizing appearance frequency, OregairuChar serves as a
valuable resource for exploring computational narrative dynamics and
character-centric storytelling in stylized media.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专门为工业异常检测设计的预训练表示学习框架，通过角度和范数导向的对比损失来最大化正常与异常特征之间的差异，并在大规模异常检测数据集上进行预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的异常检测方法依赖于ImageNet预训练特征，但ImageNet预训练与异常检测目标不匹配，且自然图像与工业图像存在分布偏移，导致预训练特征在AD任务中表现欠佳。

Method: 提出角度和范数导向的对比损失，在大规模AD数据集RealIAD上进行预训练，使用残差特征来学习类别泛化表示，以缓解预训练数据与下游AD数据集之间的分布偏移。

Result: 在五个AD数据集和五个骨干网络上进行的广泛实验表明，所提出的预训练特征在五个嵌入式AD方法中均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: 该研究为异常检测领域提供了专门设计的预训练表示，显著提升了AD任务的性能，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepEyesV2是一个代理式多模态模型，通过两阶段训练流程（冷启动阶段和强化学习阶段）实现稳健的工具调用行为，在真实世界理解、数学推理和搜索密集型任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理式多模态模型不仅需要理解文本和图像，还需要主动调用外部工具（如代码执行环境和网络搜索）并将这些操作整合到推理过程中。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：冷启动阶段建立工具使用模式，强化学习阶段进一步优化工具调用。构建了多样化、适度挑战的训练数据集，并引入RealX-Bench评估基准。

Result: DeepEyesV2在RealX-Bench和其他代表性基准测试中表现出色，能够根据任务自适应地调用工具，在感知任务中使用图像操作，在推理任务中使用数值计算。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够实现复杂的工具组合，使模型能够根据上下文选择性调用工具。这项研究为开发代理式多模态模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中超声分割结直肠肝转移瘤对实现阴性切缘至关重要，但由于对比度低、噪声大和操作者依赖性，传统方法面临挑战。自动分割可提高超声导航的精度和效率。

Method: 使用85名患者的3D术中超声数据训练3D U-Net，比较完整体积和裁剪体积两种模型。通过nnU-Net框架实现，集成到3D Slicer中供实时使用。

Result: 裁剪体积模型显著优于完整体积模型（AUC-ROC 0.898 vs 0.718），中位Dice系数0.74，召回率0.79，Hausdorff距离17.1mm，处理时间约1分钟。

Conclusion: 裁剪版3D U-Net为结直肠肝转移瘤提供可靠、近实时的自动分割，无需配准即可实现高效超声导航，显著减少人工工作量和手术时间。

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于Chamfer距离的点云生成评估指标缺乏鲁棒性，无法准确捕捉几何保真度和局部形状一致性，需要更可靠的评估方法和更好的生成模型。

Result: 在ShapeNet数据集上的实验表明，该模型在生成点云质量方面优于先前解决方案，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估指标和开发新的transformer架构，本文为点云生成提供了更可靠的评估方法和更高质量的生成模型。

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO
sculptures.

Motivation: 传统自我报告方法存在回忆偏差，基于摄像头的方法涉及隐私问题，现有可穿戴方法主要针对有限食物类型，无法满足中餐多样性需求。

Method: 集成智能手表的手部动作和智能眼镜的头部动态，设计两阶段检测流程：第一阶段识别进食状态，第二阶段进行细粒度食物类型识别。

Result: 在包含11种食物类别和10名参与者的27.5小时IMU记录数据集上，系统在进食状态检测和食物分类方面均实现了高准确率。

Conclusion: CuisineSense为无干扰、基于可穿戴设备的饮食监测提供了一个实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS拒绝环境（如行星探测）中，视觉地点识别因混叠和弱纹理而失效，LiDAR方法则受稀疏性和模糊性影响，需要更稳健的闭环检测方案。

Method: 使用基于transformer的基础模型，采用两阶段视觉检索策略：DINOv2特征+SALAD聚合进行候选筛选，SONATA LiDAR描述符进行几何验证，并结合显式6-DoF位姿估计。

Result: 在S3LI数据集和S3LI Vulcano数据集上，MPRF在精度上优于最先进的检索方法，并在低纹理区域增强了位姿估计的稳健性。

Conclusion: MPRF在精度、效率和可靠性之间实现了有利的权衡，展示了基础模型在统一地点识别和位姿估计方面的潜力。

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level

content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

*Manuel Gomes,Bogdan Raducanu,Miguel Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Artic4D数据集和CanonSeg4D框架，用于4D铰接物体的全景分割，通过将物体部件映射到规范空间来提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了铰接物体的时间动态特性，且缺乏4D全景分割的基准数据集，阻碍了该领域的发展。

Method: 基于PartNet Mobility构建Artic4D数据集，提出CanonSeg4D框架，通过估计每帧偏移将物体部件映射到学习的规范空间，实现跨帧一致对齐。

Result: 在Artic4D数据集上的实验表明，CanonSeg4D在复杂场景下的全景分割精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 时间建模和规范对齐在动态物体理解中具有显著效果，为4D铰接物体感知的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

TL;DR: 提出了密集运动描述任务和CompMo数据集，用于3D人体运动的时序定位和动作描述，并开发了DEMO模型在该任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D人体运动与语言集成的研究主要集中在文本到运动生成，而运动理解任务相对未被充分探索。现有数据集缺乏详细的时间标注且多为短序列。

Method: 构建了CompMo数据集（6万条包含多个动作的复杂运动序列），并提出了DEMO模型，将大语言模型与简单运动适配器集成，生成密集的时序基础描述。

Result: DEMO模型在CompMo数据集和适应基准测试中显著优于现有方法，为3D运动理解和描述建立了强大的基线。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了3D运动理解领域的空白，通过新任务、数据集和模型推动了密集运动描述的发展，为未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

*Junwen Pan,Qizhe Zhang,Rui Zhang,Ming Lu,Xin Wan,Yuan Zhang,Chang Liu,Qi She*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeSearch-R将时序搜索重新定义为交错式文本-视频思考，通过强化学习将视频片段搜索无缝集成到推理过程中，并引入GRPO-CSV方法来解决中间搜索决策监督不足的问题，在多个基准测试上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序搜索方法通常依赖手工设计的搜索过程，缺乏端到端优化来学习最优搜索策略。

Method: 提出TimeSearch-R框架，将时序搜索重新定义为交错式文本-视频思考，使用强化学习（特别是GRPO-CSV方法）来优化搜索策略，并构建专门的数据集用于训练。

Result: 在Haystack-LVBench、Haystack-Ego4D等时序搜索基准以及VideoMME、MLVU等长视频理解基准上取得显著改进，在LongVideoBench上相比基础模型Qwen2.5-VL提升4.1%，相比先进视频推理模型Video-R1提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R通过将时序搜索重新定义为交错式推理过程，并引入GRPO-CSV方法，显著提升了时序搜索和长视频理解的性能，建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

*Zehui Feng,Tian Qiu,Tong Wu,Junxuan Li,Huayuan Xu,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PreResQ-R1框架，通过偏好-响应解耦强化学习统一绝对分数回归和相对排名一致性，在视觉质量评估任务中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中主要依赖监督微调或仅排名目标，导致推理浅层、分数校准差和跨域泛化能力有限

Method: 采用双分支奖励公式，分别建模样本内响应一致性和样本间偏好对齐，通过组相对策略优化(GRPO)进行优化，并设计了全局-时间和局部-空间数据流策略用于视频质量评估

Result: 仅使用6K图像和28K视频进行强化学习微调，在10个IQA和5个VQA基准测试中均达到最先进水平，IQA任务中SRCC和PLCC分别提升5.30%和2.15%

Conclusion: PreResQ-R1不仅实现定量性能提升，还产生与人类对齐的推理轨迹，揭示质量判断背后的感知线索

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于复杂的手部几何、外观和关节结构，特别是在无约束光照和有限视角下，从图像创建高质量个性化手部化身仍然具有挑战性。现有数据集缺乏准确的3D几何、高分辨率多视角图像和多样化的受试者群体。

Method: 提出了PALM数据集和PALM-Net基线方法，通过基于物理的逆向渲染学习多受试者的手部几何和材质属性先验，实现逼真、可重照明的单图像手部化身个性化。

Result: PALM数据集提供了丰富的肤色、年龄和几何变化，其规模和多样性使其成为手部建模和相关研究的宝贵现实世界资源。

Conclusion: PALM数据集解决了手部建模中的数据稀缺问题，为创建高质量个性化手部化身提供了重要基础，PALM-Net展示了该数据集的实用性。

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的卷积层修改方法，用于持续学习图像修复任务，无需修改主干架构，能够无缝应用于任何深度架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习在图像修复领域面临独特挑战：处理大尺寸图像和不同退化类型的多样性。现有方法需要大量工程化的架构修改，计算开销大，而正则化方法不适用于修复任务。

Method: 通过简单修改卷积层来适应先前修复任务的知识，不触及主干架构，可无缝应用于任何深度架构，增加可训练参数但不会显著增加计算开销或推理时间。

Result: 实验验证表明，新修复任务的引入不会影响现有任务的性能，且通过适应先前任务创建的知识库，新修复任务的性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像修复领域的持续学习提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，能够在不增加显著计算成本的情况下持续学习新任务。

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/aupendu/continual-restore.

TL;DR: 提出基于HierSpeech++潜在语音表示的文本到说话人脸合成框架，通过Text-to-Vec模块从文本生成Wav2Vec2嵌入，联合调节语音和面部生成。采用两阶段训练处理TTS预测特征的分布偏移，实现紧密的视听对齐。


<details>

Motivation: 解决文本到说话人脸合成中音频-视觉对齐的挑战，避免推理时依赖真实音频，同时保持说话人身份和自然表情。

Method: 使用Text-to-Vec模块生成Wav2Vec2嵌入作为条件，采用两阶段训练：先在Wav2Vec2嵌入上预训练，然后在TTS输出上微调，处理分布偏移问题。

Result: 实验表明，基于TTS预测潜在特征的条件优于级联管道，在唇部同步和视觉真实感方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成自然、富有表现力的语音和同步的面部运动，无需推理时的真实音频，实现了高质量的文本到说话人脸合成。

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

TL;DR: 提出gitmerge3D方法，通过全局信息图令牌合并技术，将3D点云变换器中的令牌数量减少90-95%，同时保持竞争性能，挑战了更多令牌带来更好性能的普遍假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云变换器依赖密集令牌表示，导致训练和推理时计算和内存成本高昂，研究发现令牌存在显著冗余，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出gitmerge3D方法，一种全局信息图令牌合并技术，通过识别和合并冗余令牌来大幅减少令牌数量。

Result: 在多个3D视觉任务中验证，令牌数量减少90-95%的同时保持竞争性能，计算效率得到一致提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个评估大规模3D变换器模型冗余性的工作，为开发更高效的3D基础架构提供了见解，挑战了当前模型过度令牌化和可扩展性优化不足的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

TL;DR: 该研究验证了中分辨率Copernicus卫星图像可用于建筑物损坏评估，并发布了xBD-S12数据集，发现复杂模型架构在泛化性上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害需要快速损坏评估来指导人道主义响应，但超高分辨率图像可用性有限，因此研究是否可用中分辨率地球观测图像补充。

Method: 引入xBD-S12数据集，包含10,315对Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2灾前灾后图像对，进行一系列实验评估建筑物损坏检测和映射能力。

Result: 尽管只有10米地面采样距离，但在许多灾害场景中能较好地检测和映射建筑物损坏；复杂模型架构泛化到未见灾害时表现不佳，地理空间基础模型实际效益有限。

Conclusion: Copernicus图像是快速、广域损坏评估的可行数据源，可与超高分辨率图像协同发挥作用。

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

Motivation: 传统照片年代估计主要依赖场景信息，而人脸作为照片中的重要元素，包含丰富的年代信息，特别是当图像中有多个可识别个体时。

Method: 提出概率框架，结合现代人脸识别和年龄估计模型的视觉证据，以及基于职业生涯的时间先验，来推断照片拍摄年份。

Result: 实验表明，聚合多个人脸的证据能持续提升性能，该方法在包含多个可识别个体的图像上显著优于基于场景的基线方法。

Conclusion: 利用多个人脸信息进行照片年代估计是有效的，特别是当图像中有多个可识别个体时，该方法比传统场景方法表现更好。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

Conclusion: 神经形态传感器事件数据能够有效捕捉动态流动特征，为实验控制和智能热管理提供可靠的实时反馈

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of
backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of
multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in
resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of
integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone
architectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupKAN是一种轻量级医学图像分割网络，通过分组KAN变换和分组KAN激活模块，在减少参数的同时提高分割精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学图像分割模型中卷积架构缺乏自适应非线性、Transformer架构计算复杂度高且可解释性差的问题，以及U-KAN模型随着通道数增加而面临的可扩展性限制。

Method: 提出两个结构化功能模块：1) 分组KAN变换，将通道划分为G组进行多元样条映射，将复杂度从O(C^2)降低到O(C^2/G)；2) 分组KAN激活，在每个通道组内应用共享的样条映射实现高效的token-wise非线性。

Result: 在三个医学基准数据集(BUSI、GlaS和CVC)上，GroupKAN平均IoU达到79.80%，比U-KAN提高1.11%，参数量仅为U-KAN的47.6%(3.02M vs 6.35M)，并显示出更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GroupKAN通过分组策略有效解决了U-KAN的可扩展性问题，在保持高精度的同时显著减少了模型参数，为医学图像分割提供了更高效、更可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

Method: 1. 构建VST-P数据集（410万样本，19种技能）用于空间感知训练；2. 构建VST-R数据集（13.5万样本）用于空间推理训练；3. 采用渐进式训练流程：监督微调建立基础空间知识，然后强化学习提升空间推理能力。

Result: VST在多个空间基准测试中达到最先进水平：MMSI-Bench上34.8%，VSIBench上61.2%。模型在提升空间能力的同时不损害通用能力。

Conclusion: 提出的空间调优范式能显著增强视觉-语言-动作模型，为更物理接地的人工智能铺平道路。

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

### [69] [Epistemic Reject Option Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04855)
*Vojtech Franc,Jakub Paplham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于认知不确定性的拒绝选项预测器，在数据不足导致认知不确定性高的区域拒绝预测，以最小化期望遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝选项方法仅关注偶然不确定性，假设训练数据充足使得认知不确定性可忽略。但在实际应用中，数据有限使得这一假设不成立，需要同时考虑认知不确定性。

Method: 基于贝叶斯学习，重新定义最优预测器为最小化期望遗憾的预测器。当给定输入的遗憾超过指定拒绝成本时，模型拒绝预测。

Result: 提出了第一个原则性框架，能够学习识别训练数据不足以做出可靠决策的输入。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用中处理数据不足导致的认知不确定性提供了理论依据和实用方法。

Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate
predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option
prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction
uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on
aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes
the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,
limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the
epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic
uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we
redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the
performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with
full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for
a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of
identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable
decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DMA是一个在线学习框架，通过整合多粒度人类反馈来动态调整RAG系统的检索排序，实现实时适应而不牺牲基础检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统依赖静态检索，无法适应不断变化的用户意图和内容漂移，需要动态适应机制。

Method: DMA将文档级、列表级和响应级信号整合到连贯的学习流程中：监督训练点对和列表排序器，基于响应级偏好的策略优化，以及将知识蒸馏到轻量级评分器中。

Result: 在线工业部署显示人类参与度显著提升，离线测试在对话式QA任务上表现优异，同时保持基础检索竞争力。

Conclusion: DMA为RAG系统提供了一种原则性的反馈驱动实时适应方法，无需牺牲基线能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval,
limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic
Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically
incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive
settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a
coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise
rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and
knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.
Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is
the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)
large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback
source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.
Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial
improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive
foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA
(TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a
principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without
sacrificing baseline capability.

TL;DR: 提出了实时推理作为动态环境中智能体的新问题框架，构建了Real-Time Reasoning Gym进行验证，比较了反应式智能体和规划式智能体两种范式，并提出了同时使用两种范式的AgileThinker方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的智能体需要在推理过程中对动态环境做出及时判断，而现有语言模型推理方法未能考虑环境的动态特性。

Method: 研究两种语言模型部署范式：反应式智能体（有限推理计算快速响应）和规划式智能体（扩展推理计算处理复杂问题），并提出同时使用两种范式的AgileThinker方法。

Result: 实验表明即使最先进的模型也难以在任一范式中做出逻辑且及时的判断，而AgileThinker在任务难度和时间压力增加时始终优于单一范式的智能体。

Conclusion: 实时推理是开发实用智能体的关键测试平台，为时间约束AI系统研究奠定了基础，指明了实现实时能力智能体的路径。

Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely
judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:
hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's
reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,
existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce
real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving
environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two
paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which
employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,
and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex
problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with
making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this
limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both
reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only
one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,
effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work
establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical
agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI
systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统专家工作流程耗时、易积压，难以跟上不断变化的监管边界，需要更高效透明的合规决策系统。

Method: 使用小型协作智能体（检索、描述精炼、分类器、验证器、反馈记录器），通过智能体间消息传递和模型上下文协议进行协调，实现模型无关的本地操作。

Result: 在真实高风险财产案例的初步测试中，ORCHID相比非智能体基线提高了准确性和可追溯性，同时将不确定项目转交给领域专家。

Conclusion: ORCHID展示了在敏感能源部合规工作流程中实现可信赖大语言模型辅助的实用路径。

Abstract: High-Risk Property (HRP) classification is critical at U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) sites, where inventories include sensitive and often dual-use
equipment. Compliance must track evolving rules designated by various export
control policies to make transparent and auditable decisions. Traditional
expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep
pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic
system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small
cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and
feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools
through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise
operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with
step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles
(run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID
improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring
uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows
single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and
exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM
assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows.

TL;DR: 提出一种支持军事地面作战决策的方法论，为机械化营生成和评估行动方案，通过系统生成数千个行动备选方案并基于预期结果进行评价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在军事地面作战执行阶段需要有效的决策支持，特别是在机械化营的行动规划中，需要系统性地生成和评估各种行动方案以优化作战效果。

Method: 从初始行动方案集开始，基于预期结果评估，系统生成数千个个体行动备选方案，然后评估识别具有更优结果的替代行动方案。考虑对手状态和行动、部队组成、力量比、攻防类型和预期推进率等因素。

Result: 生成和评估过程并行工作，产生多样化的替代行动方案，便于基于先前评估的行动管理新方案生成。随着战斗进展和条件变化，在顺序决策框架内为决策者制定修订的行动方案。

Conclusion: 该方法论为军事地面作战提供了有效的决策支持，能够动态生成和评估行动方案，适应不断变化的战场条件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making
during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus
on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for
various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an
initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces
thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at
identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These
alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,
considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and
anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and
advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work
concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This
approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on
previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve,
revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a
sequential decision-making framework.

Motivation: 汽车行业预测性维护面临经济约束、数据集稀缺和专业知识短缺等挑战，LLM的进展为克服这些障碍提供了机会，加速PdM从研究到工业实践的转化。

Method: 使用LLM-based智能体来支持PdM数据清洗流程，专注于处理维护日志中的错误（如拼写错误、缺失字段、近似重复条目和错误日期等六种噪声类型）。

Result: 研究发现LLM在处理通用清洗任务方面表现有效，为未来工业应用提供了有前景的基础。虽然领域特定错误仍具挑战性，但结果表明通过专门训练和增强智能体能力可以进一步改进。

Conclusion: LLM在预测性维护数据清洗中具有显著潜力，特别是在处理维护日志噪声方面，为工业应用奠定了基础，未来可通过专业化改进解决领域特定挑战。

Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility
and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key
challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in
the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents
an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM
from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the
potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks
and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While
domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the
potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced
agentic capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一个支持推理能力的城市规划AI代理框架，整合认知层和逻辑组件，通过多代理协作实现价值导向、规则约束和可解释的规划决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI在城市规划分析中已很成功，但需要向AI辅助决策发展，让代理能够推荐地点、分配资源、评估权衡，并透明地推理约束和利益相关者价值。

Method: 开发了Agentic Urban Planning AI框架，包含三个认知层（感知、基础、推理）和六个逻辑组件（分析、生成、验证、评估、协作、决策），通过多代理协作框架实现。

Result: 展示了规划决策需要明确的推理能力：基于价值（应用规范原则）、规则基础（保证约束满足）和可解释（生成透明论证），这是统计学习无法单独实现的。

Conclusion: 该框架显示AI代理可以通过系统探索解决方案空间、验证法规合规性和透明地权衡利弊来增强人类规划者，不是取代人类判断，而是用计算推理能力来放大它。

Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning
patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is
AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,
and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and
stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,
ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision
achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for
reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers
(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,
Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a
multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions
require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying
normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),
and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that
statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with
statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark
evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework
shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring
solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over
trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with
computational reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出动态自适应融合(DAFM)方法，通过多模型协作解决组合图像检索中的特征融合和相似度匹配问题，在CIRR和FashionIQ基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合图像检索方法依赖单一模型同时处理特征融合和相似度匹配，面临两个主要挑战：1)单一模型无法同时关注整体和细节，难以捕捉图像与文本间的细微关联；2)缺乏动态权重分配机制，无法自适应利用不同模型的互补优势。

Method: 提出动态自适应融合(DAFM)框架，利用异构模型的互补优势，自适应重新平衡它们的贡献，实现多模型协作。该方法不依赖于融合顺序，具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在CIRR基准上获得Recall@10为93.21，Rmean为84.43；在FashionIQ基准上平均Rmean为67.48，比现有强基线方法提升高达4.5%。

Conclusion: 动态多模型协作为组合图像检索提供了有效且通用的解决方案，能够显著提升检索精度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a cross-modal task that aims to retrieve
target images from large-scale databases using a reference image and a
modification text. Most existing methods rely on a single model to perform
feature fusion and similarity matching. However, this paradigm faces two major
challenges. First, one model alone can't see the whole picture and the tiny
details at the same time; it has to handle different tasks with the same
weights, so it often misses the small but important links between image and
text. Second, the absence of dynamic weight allocation prevents adaptive
leveraging of complementary model strengths, so the resulting embedding drifts
away from the target and misleads the nearest-neighbor search in CIR. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for
multi-model collaboration in CIR. Rather than optimizing a single method in
isolation, DAFM exploits the complementary strengths of heterogeneous models
and adaptively rebalances their contributions. This not only maximizes
retrieval accuracy but also ensures that the performance gains are independent
of the fusion order, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Experiments
on the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Our
method achieves a Recall@10 of 93.21 and an Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and an
average Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing recent strong baselines by up
to 4.5%. These results confirm that dynamic multi-model collaboration provides
an effective and general solution for CIR.

Motivation: 地理传感器数据对现代国防安全至关重要，但现有3D表示方法在几何精度和视觉保真度之间存在权衡，需要找到既能保证几何准确性又能提供高保真视觉效果的综合解决方案。

Method: 对传统表示方法（点云、体素网格、三角网格）和现代神经隐式方法（NeRF、3DGS）进行对比分析，评估它们在几何精度和视觉保真度方面的表现。

Result: 评估显示传统模型在几何精度方面表现稳健，适合功能性任务如视线分析和物理模拟；现代方法能产生高保真度的照片级真实感视觉效果，但几何可靠性往往不足。

Conclusion: 提出混合方法是最有前景的发展方向，建议构建结合传统网格骨架（保证几何完整性）和神经表示（如3DGS提供视觉细节）的系统架构，通过分层场景结构确保可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Geospatial sensor data is essential for modern defense and security, offering
indispensable 3D information for situational awareness. This data, gathered
from sources like lidar sensors and optical cameras, allows for the creation of
detailed models of operational environments. In this paper, we provide a
comparative analysis of traditional representation methods, such as point
clouds, voxel grids, and triangle meshes, alongside modern neural and implicit
techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). Our evaluation reveals a fundamental trade-off: traditional models
offer robust geometric accuracy ideal for functional tasks like line-of-sight
analysis and physics simulations, while modern methods excel at producing
high-fidelity, photorealistic visuals but often lack geometric reliability.
Based on these findings, we conclude that a hybrid approach is the most
promising path forward. We propose a system architecture that combines a
traditional mesh scaffold for geometric integrity with a neural representation
like 3DGS for visual detail, managed within a hierarchical scene structure to
ensure scalability and performance.

Abstract: We integrate smoothing B-splines into a standard differentiable vector

used to generate smooth and arbitrarily long paths within image-based deep

parametric control of fidelity vs. simplicity tradeoffs, while also enabling
stylization control in geometric and image spaces. The proposed pipeline is
compatible with recent vector graphics generation and vectorization methods. We
demonstrate the versatility of our approach with four applications aimed at the
generation of stylized vector graphics: stylized space-filling path generation,
stroke-based image abstraction, closed-area image abstraction, and stylized

### [79] [Stateful KV Cache Management for LLMs: Balancing Space, Time, Accuracy, and Positional Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04686)
*Pratik Poudel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KV缓存管理策略在接近模型训练上下文窗口时会严重影响LLM生成质量，位置编码的完整性比缓存大小更重要，保持连续上下文块的简单策略优于复杂的位置破坏性策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在多轮对话场景中KV缓存无限增长的问题，以及缓存管理策略与模型架构限制、位置编码完整性之间的相互作用。

Method: 使用状态化基准测试框架进行实证分析，比较不同缓存驱逐策略（包括高保留率策略和保持连续上下文的策略）对生成质量的影响。

Result: 当累积KV缓存接近或超过模型训练上下文窗口时，LLM生成质量急剧下降；即使高保留率的驱逐策略如果破坏位置一致性也会恶化性能；保持连续上下文块的简单策略能产生更连贯的生成结果。

Conclusion: 缓存驱逐技术应尊重架构限制、保持位置结构，并将"缓存健康"视为超越单纯大小的整体概念。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in
large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn
scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between
KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of
positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking
framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the
accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window
(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory
exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via
AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.
Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a
cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to
degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving
contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more
coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate
for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional
structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了BOLD信号的多频特性，将信号视为单一时间序列处理，而神经疾病通常在特定频段表现出异常，这限制了诊断的敏感性和特异性。

Method: 采用自适应级联分解学习每个脑区的任务相关频率子带，使用频率耦合连接学习捕获频段内和跨频段的相互作用，构建统一功能网络，并通过统一图卷积网络进行消息传递生成节点表示。

Result: 在ADNI和ABIDE数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应学习多频段特征和频率耦合连接，有效提升了脑部疾病诊断的性能。

Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders
and constructing brain functional connectivity networks
  by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els
largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations,
  treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial
fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within
  specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
  While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they
often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be
  optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations.
  To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade
Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each
  brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture
  both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional
  network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism
within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations
  for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE
  datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网环境中传感器信号的非平稳性和多尺度特性使得长期时间序列预测具有挑战性，传统方法局限于时域操作，而傅里叶变换获得的全局频率信息被视为平稳信号，会模糊瞬态事件的时间模式。

Method: 提出AWEMixer网络，包含两个创新组件：1）频率路由器利用快速傅里叶变换获得的全局周期性模式自适应加权局部小波子带；2）相干门控融合块通过交叉注意力和门控机制实现突出频率特征与多尺度时间表示的选择性集成。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试中验证了模型的有效性，相比基于Transformer和MLP的最先进模型，在长序列时间序列预测中持续实现性能提升。

Conclusion: AWEMixer能够实现精确的时频定位，同时对噪声保持鲁棒性，在长期时间序列预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant
challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor
signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality
when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to
operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by
Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the
temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive
Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a
Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by
Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a
Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent
frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through
cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency
localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate
that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models.
Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared
with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence
time series forecasting. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合TCN和改良TFT的RUL预测框架，通过Bi-LSTM编码器-解码器增强时间特征提取，在多时间窗口方法下显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RUL预测模型难以捕捉细粒度时间依赖关系，且无法动态优先处理关键特征，影响了工业系统的可靠性预测效果。

Method: 集成时序卷积网络(TCN)进行局部时间特征提取，结合改良的时序融合变换器(TFT)和Bi-LSTM编码器-解码器架构，采用多时间窗口方法适应不同工况。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，该模型将平均RMSE降低了5.5%，相比现有最优方法具有更高的预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架弥补了现有方法的不足，提升了工业预测系统的有效性，展示了先进时序变换器在RUL预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime,
and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models
struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically
prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a
modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder.
This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while
emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a
multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating
conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its
improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing
critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness
of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced
time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种传感器引导的GLISp扩展方法，通过整合可测量的传感器数据和物理知识来增强偏好学习，在保持偏好搜索灵活性的同时注入灰盒结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好优化方法如GLISp将系统视为黑盒，忽略了信息丰富的传感器测量数据。

Method: 引入传感器引导的正则化GLISp扩展，通过物理知识启发的假设函数和最小二乘正则化项将可测量描述符整合到偏好学习循环中。

Result: 在分析基准和车辆悬架调校任务上的数值评估显示，相比基线GLISp具有更快的收敛速度和更优的最终解。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将主观反馈与定量传感器信息相结合，在保持偏好搜索灵活性的同时提高了性能。

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop calibration is often addressed via preference-based
optimization, where algorithms learn from pairwise comparisons rather than
explicit cost evaluations. While effective, methods such as Preferential
Bayesian Optimization or Global optimization based on active preference
learning with radial basis functions (GLISp) treat the system as a black box
and ignore informative sensor measurements. In this work, we introduce a
sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates measurable
descriptors into the preference-learning loop through a physics-informed
hypothesis function and a least-squares regularization term. This injects
grey-box structure, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor
information while preserving the flexibility of preference-based search.
Numerical evaluations on an analytical benchmark and on a human-in-the-loop
vehicle suspension tuning task show faster convergence and superior final
solutions compared to baseline GLISp.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在数据稀缺和分布偏移场景下，通过知识蒸馏(KD)诱导和加速grokking现象的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在训练样本低于临界阈值时无法观测到grokking现象的情况，以及在实际分布偏移场景中如何实现泛化。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏从已在分布p1上grokked的模型转移到分布p2，研究联合分布训练和持续预训练设置。

Result: KD能够诱导和加速在不同分布上的grokking，即使在数据稀缺情况下也能实现泛化，并在持续学习中缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在低数据和分布演化设置中对于实现泛化具有核心作用，为grokking机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where models
exhibit delayed generalization following overfitting on training data. We focus
on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the
critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios
involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD)
from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and
accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available
data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for
deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We
then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that
while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has
insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual
distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual
pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find
that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting,
achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our
results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge
transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in
low-data and evolving distribution settings.

TL;DR: FuseFlow是一个将PyTorch稀疏模型转换为融合稀疏数据流图的编译器，支持跨表达式融合、并行化等优化，针对可重构数据流架构，通过设计空间探索发现完整融合并非总是最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型规模扩大，稀疏计算和专用数据流硬件成为解决效率问题的有效方案。需要编译器支持将稀疏模型转换为高效的数据流图。

Method: 开发FuseFlow编译器，支持跨表达式融合、并行化、数据流排序和稀疏分块等优化，针对可重构数据流架构，使用周期精确的数据流模拟器进行微架构分析。

Result: 在四个真实世界机器学习应用中，发现完整融合对稀疏模型并非总是最优，融合粒度取决于模型本身。FuseFlow提供启发式方法识别和剪枝次优配置，在GPT-3上实现约2.7倍加速。

Conclusion: FuseFlow是首个支持通用跨表达式稀疏操作融合的编译器，通过设计空间探索揭示了融合策略对稀疏模型性能的重要性，并为稀疏计算提供了有效的编译优化方案。

Abstract: As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow
hardware have emerged as powerful solutions to address efficiency. We propose
FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in
PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow
architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general
cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across
kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like
parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a
cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion
strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world
machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire
cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not
always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model
itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal
configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including
a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse
attention.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对云工作负载的指令预取设计，通过压缩条目、分层元数据存储和在线ML控制器来提高效率，减少片上状态同时保持性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模网络服务依赖深度软件栈和微服务编排，这会增加指令足迹并造成前端停顿，从而推高尾延迟和能耗。需要重新审视指令预取技术来应对这些云工作负载挑战。

Method: 基于纠缠指令预取器(EIP)，引入压缩条目(36位捕获8个目标)、分层元数据存储(片上保留L1常驻和频繁查询条目，虚拟化批量元数据到下级存储)，以及轻量级在线ML控制器(使用上下文特征和带臂调整阈值评分预取收益)。

Result: 在数据中心应用中，该方法在减少片上状态的同时保持了类似EIP的性能提升，并为ML时代的网络服务提高了效率。

Conclusion: 该设计通过压缩存储、分层管理和智能控制，为现代云工作负载提供了高效的指令预取解决方案，在保持性能的同时优化了资源使用效率。

Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice
orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls
that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for
these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self
optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we
introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a
base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical
Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried
entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further
add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using
context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications,
our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and
improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病具有异质性和演变的脑形态模式，现有方法难以处理不规则稀疏的MRI数据，且难以捕捉个体异质性（如发病时间、进展速度和症状严重程度的变化）。

Method: 使用条件神经ODE框架，将脑形态变化建模为连续时间过程，联合学习患者特定初始时间和进展速度来对齐个体轨迹到共享进展轨迹。

Result: 在帕金森病进展标志物倡议数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在预测纵向PD进展方面优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: CNODE框架能够有效建模帕金森病的连续个体化进展轨迹，解决了现有方法在处理不规则数据和个体异质性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry
patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight,
treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However,
existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer
architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling
to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts.
Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity
including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity,
which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE
(Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD
progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain
changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition,
we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align
individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE
on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
forecasting longitudinal PD progression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表示学习在预测任务中很成功，但在因果任务（如预测干预效果）中可能失败，因此需要将表示学习与因果推断结合，利用日益丰富的多模态数据。

Method: 提出了一个统计和计算框架，使用观察性和扰动性数据来执行因果发现，利用多模态系统视图学习因果变量，并设计最优扰动。

Result: 论文概述了一个框架，但未提供具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 表示学习与因果推断的结合以及多模态数据的利用为解决生物医学中的因果问题提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of
complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning
has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning
latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring
any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely
successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including
predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage
between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity
in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data
(observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the
single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical
and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning
motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use
observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed
causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal
variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuetServe是一个统一的LLM服务框架，通过动态GPU空间多路复用在单个GPU内实现预填充和解码阶段的解耦，在需要时提供阶段隔离以避免干扰，同时保持高吞吐量和低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统要么在共享GPU上聚合预填充和解码阶段导致干扰，要么跨GPU解耦但造成资源浪费。需要一种既能保持隔离又能高效利用资源的方法。

Method: DuetServe默认在聚合模式下运行，当预测到TBT退化时动态激活SM级GPU空间多路复用。包括注意力感知屋顶模型预测迭代延迟、分区优化器选择最优SM分割、无中断执行引擎消除CPU-GPU同步开销。

Result: 评估显示DuetServe相比最先进框架，总吞吐量提升高达1.3倍，同时保持低生成延迟。

Conclusion: DuetServe通过动态细粒度的SM分区，在单个GPU内实现了预填充和解码阶段的智能解耦，有效平衡了资源利用和性能隔离的需求。

Abstract: Modern LLM serving systems must sustain high throughput while meeting strict
latency SLOs across two distinct inference phases: compute-intensive prefill
and memory-bound decode phases. Existing approaches either (1) aggregate both
phases on shared GPUs, leading to interference between prefill and decode
phases, which degrades time-between-tokens (TBT); or (2) disaggregate the two
phases across GPUs, improving latency but wasting resources through duplicated
models and KV cache transfers. We present DuetServe, a unified LLM serving
framework that achieves disaggregation-level isolation within a single GPU.
DuetServe operates in aggregated mode by default and dynamically activates
SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing when TBT degradation is predicted. Its key
idea is to decouple prefill and decode execution only when needed through
fine-grained, adaptive SM partitioning that provides phase isolation only when
contention threatens latency service level objectives (SLOs). DuetServe
integrates (1) an attention-aware roofline model to forecast iteration latency,
(2) a partitioning optimizer that selects the optimal SM split to maximize
throughput under TBT constraints, and (3) an interruption-free execution engine
that eliminates CPU-GPU synchronization overhead. Evaluations show that
DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3x while maintaining low
generation latency compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

Motivation: 提出一种紧凑、可解释且理论基础的替代方案，以替代密集MLP和边缘样条网络，同时提供更好的校准和推理延迟。

Method: 使用度数为m的Bernstein-Bezier多项式与轻量可逆扭曲配对，通过形状正则化、半离散OT覆盖和可微分边翻转进行端到端训练。

Result: 在合成逼近任务、表格回归/分类以及作为紧凑CNN的替代头部时，SiFEN在匹配参数预算下优于或等同于MLP和KAN，改善了校准并减少了推理延迟。

Conclusion: SiFEN是一个紧凑、可解释且理论基础的替代方案，适用于密集MLP和边缘样条网络，具有更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: We introduce Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a learned piecewise-polynomial
predictor that represents f: R^d -> R^k as a globally C^r finite-element field
on a learned simplicial mesh in an optionally warped input space. Each query
activates exactly one simplex and at most d+1 basis functions via barycentric
coordinates, yielding explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and
cache-friendly sparsity. SiFEN pairs degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with
a light invertible warp and trains end-to-end with shape regularization,
semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips. Under standard
shape-regularity and bi-Lipschitz warp assumptions, SiFEN achieves the classic
FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices. Empirically, on synthetic
approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and as a drop-in head
on compact CNNs, SiFEN matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameter
budgets, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency
due to geometric locality. These properties make SiFEN a compact,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and
edge-spline networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型因存储所有专家参数而导致的高内存开销问题，特别是在专家数量增加时，现有方法在高压缩比下性能下降明显。

Method: 1. 稀疏专家合并：通过识别权重冗余和专业化，使用双掩码捕获共享和专家特定参数；2. 位打包编码：复用未充分利用的指数位，避免存储二进制掩码和符号的开销。

Result: 压缩MoE模型高达50%，在MMLU任务上比现有方法提升16.7%，推理速度提升1.28倍，在各种任务上保持准确性。

Conclusion: PuzzleMoE提供了一种高效的无训练MoE压缩解决方案，在高压缩比下保持性能，支持在GPU上高效推理。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling
language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per
input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high
memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as
the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have
explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from
performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce
PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high
accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE
performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy
and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and
expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary
masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses
underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up
to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it
outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50%
compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体积假说认为深度学习有效是因为平坦极小值体积大，但这无法解释大数据集在泛化中的作用。

Method: 通过在不同训练数据量下测量极小值体积，研究损失景观的变化。

Result: 发现存在泛化良好的尖锐极小值，但由于体积小而不易被找到；增加数据会使这些极小值相对变大。

Conclusion: 数据量通过改变损失景观结构来影响泛化性能，而不仅仅是平坦极小值的体积效应。

Abstract: The volume hypothesis suggests deep learning is effective because it is
likely to find flat minima due to their large volumes, and flat minima
generalize well. This picture does not explain the role of large datasets in
generalization. Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data
reveals sharp minima which generalize well exist, but are unlikely to be found
due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape, such
that previously small generalizing minima become (relatively) large.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as promising molecules to combat

peptides from negative sequences and incorporates their functional annotations
into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, capturing activities across
antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic classes. Building on
ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and
structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides.
Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average
Precision over the second-best method adapted for this task, establishing a new

Abstract: We explore the recently introduced persistent reachability homology (PRH) of
digraph data, i.e. data in the form of directed graphs. In particular, we study
the effectiveness of PRH in network classification task in a key neuroscience
problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of
digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main
advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs
appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller
digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that
PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and
their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support
vector machine.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about
their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input
text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1)
fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free
guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that
combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even
degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical
incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined
effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually
simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in
training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through
concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and
can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate
its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent
improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of
input prompts.

*Brenda Nogueira,Meng Jiang,Nitesh V. Chawla,Nuno Moniz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPECTRA是一个光谱目标感知的图增强框架，通过在光谱域生成真实的分子图来解决分子属性预测中稀有化合物预测性能差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分子属性预测中，最有价值的化合物（如高效力）通常占据目标空间的稀疏区域。标准的图神经网络通常优化平均误差，在这些不常见但关键的情况下表现不佳，现有的过采样方法往往会扭曲分子拓扑结构。

Method: SPECTRA框架：(i)从SMILES重建多属性分子图；(ii)通过(Fused)Gromov-Wasserstein耦合对齐分子对以获得节点对应关系；(iii)在稳定共享基中插值拉普拉斯特征值、特征向量和节点特征；(iv)重建边以合成具有插值目标的物理合理中间体。采用基于标签核密度估计的稀有感知预算方案，将增强集中在数据稀缺区域。

Result: 在基准测试中，SPECTRA在相关目标范围内持续改善误差，同时保持竞争力的整体MAE，并产生可解释的合成分子，其结构反映了底层的光谱几何。

Conclusion: 结果表明，光谱、几何感知的增强是解决不平衡分子属性回归问题的有效且高效策略。

Abstract: In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high
potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on
these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often
distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral
Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular
graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute
molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused)
Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates
Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis;
and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates
with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a
kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are
scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions,
SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy.
On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges
while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic
molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our
results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective
and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: SDE-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have shown remarkable success in real-world sample generation tasks. Prior
analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization,
showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or
initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and
Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized
midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to
better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework
called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys
favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions,
with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure
convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM
sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with
ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate
from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of
the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with
pre-trained image synthesis models.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习模型分析美国消费者对具有创新运输证书食品的偏好，重点关注安全性和能源证书。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前研究发现运输因素在消费者食品购买决策中具有显著影响，需要进一步识别具体的运输属性价值。

Method: 采用机器学习模型分析消费者偏好实验数据，提出五种创新运输证书：运输模式、物联网、安全措施、能源来源和必须到达日期。

Result: 发现美国消费者在食品供应链运输领域明显倾向于安全和能源证书，同时价格、产品类型和决策者因素也影响购买选择。

Conclusion: 研究为改进食品供应链系统提供了数据驱动的建议。

Abstract: This paper utilizes a machine learning model to estimate the consumer's
behavior for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the
U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with
supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation
factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices.
Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific
transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was
applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were
proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures,
Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also
incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes.
The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates
within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally,
the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and
decision-maker factors on purchasing choices. Ultimately, the study offers
data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems.

TL;DR: 提出了两种互补策略来提升LLM智能体在新环境中的泛化能力：在线分布适应和部署时动态基础化，显著提高了在复杂环境中的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在新颖复杂环境中泛化能力不足，主要由于预训练与测试条件不匹配导致的语法误解（环境特定组件）和语义误解（状态转换动态）。

Method: 1. 在线分布适应：学习轻量级适应向量来偏置模型输出分布，快速对齐环境响应格式；2. 部署时动态基础化：通过角色驱动探索阶段系统探测和学习环境因果动态，构建非参数世界模型。

Result: 在函数调用和网页导航等基准测试中，两种策略都有效且计算成本低。在WebArena多站点分割中，动态基础化方法将成功率从2%提升至23%。

Conclusion: 动态基础化在复杂环境中特别有效，为构建更通用和强大的LLM智能体提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and
complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to
a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions.
This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic
misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats,
and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only
revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and
complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging
environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online
distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by
learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output
distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format.
Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven
exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal
dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world
model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,
including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the
effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal
computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective
in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle,
demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based
agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases
the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

Motivation: 探索无标签强化学习方法在不同规模语言模型上的泛化能力，特别是针对推理能力有限的小型模型，解决现有方法对小模型效果不佳的问题。

Method: 提出了一种结合课程学习和数据筛选的无标签强化学习方法：使用课程学习逐步引入更难的问题，在训练中屏蔽无多数投票的rollouts，并建立数据筛选流程生成预定义难度的样本。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有模型规模（0.5B到7B参数）和推理能力上都实现了持续改进，相比基线方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限模型提供了一条通过无监督强化学习引导推理能力的可行路径，解决了小模型在无标签强化学习中面临的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of
unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning
capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of
these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning
capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and
reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals
critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's
pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below
baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate
sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective
self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in
determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet
effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to
progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority
rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline
to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates
consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities,
providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap
reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models. We make our code available

TL;DR: SigmaDock是一种基于SE(3)黎曼扩散模型的分子对接方法，通过将配体分解为刚性片段并学习在结合口袋中重新组装这些片段，实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统生成式方法在分子对接中存在的化学不合理输出、泛化性差和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出新颖的片段化方案，将配体分解为刚性片段，然后使用SE(3)黎曼扩散模型学习在结合口袋中重新组装这些片段。

Result: 在PoseBusters数据集上达到79.9%的Top-1成功率，远超近期深度学习方法(12.7-30.8%)，并首次超越经典物理基对接方法。

Conclusion: SigmaDock在分子建模的可靠性和可行性方面实现了重大突破，是首个在PB训练-测试划分下超越经典物理基对接的深度学习方法。

Abstract: Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular
docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise
faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,
but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor
generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from
structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building
on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion
model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within
the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock
exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex
diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show
SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates
(RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8%
reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent
generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning
approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test
split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of
deep learning for molecular modelling.

Motivation: 现有的决策导向学习方法要么需要频繁调用优化器，要么依赖任务特定的代理函数，这在大规模应用中成本高昂且难以扩展。

Method: 使用对偶变量指导学习，构建DGL目标函数，将优化与梯度更新解耦，仅定期求解下游问题，在更新间隔期间使用对偶调整目标进行训练。

Result: DGL在两种问题类别上达到或超过最先进的DFL方法性能，同时显著减少求解器调用次数和训练时间。

Conclusion: DGL提供了一种可扩展的决策导向学习方法，在保持强决策对齐的同时，将训练成本推向标准监督学习水平。

Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization
problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has
motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how
the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream
decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art
methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific
surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer,
often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the
downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a
simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing
solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection
problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and
shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by
solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains
on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c)
as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard
supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that
DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity,
and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art
DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training
time. Code is available at https://github.com/paularodr/Dual-Guided-Learning.

Method: 结合指数族先验和量子玻尔兹曼分布构建混合模型，通过解析计算连续变量梯度，并集成到Actor-Critic算法中。

Result: 开发了连续Q学习框架，用CSQBM分布的高效采样替代全局最大化，克服连续控制的不稳定性。

Conclusion: CSQBM为连续动作强化学习提供了理论基础的量子经典混合方法，在减少量子资源需求的同时保持表达能力。

Abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By
combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann
distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model
that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness.
Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed
analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms.
Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces
global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby
overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

TL;DR: FoodRL是一个基于强化学习的元学习框架，用于预测食品银行中高度波动的实物捐赠，通过动态加权多种预测模型来提高预测准确性，特别是在自然灾害等干扰时期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品银行在缓解粮食不安全方面至关重要，但传统预测模型由于不可预测的波动和概念漂移（如季节性变化、飓风和野火）而无法保持一致的准确性，影响资源的公平和高效分配。

Method: 提出FoodRL框架，使用强化学习进行元学习，根据近期性能和上下文信息对不同的预测模型进行聚类和动态加权。

Result: 在两个结构不同的美国食品银行（受野火影响的西海岸大型区域食品银行和受飓风影响的东海岸州级食品银行）的多年度数据评估中，FoodRL始终优于基线方法，特别是在干扰或衰退期间。

Conclusion: FoodRL通过提供更可靠和自适应的预测，每年可促进相当于170万份额外餐食的食品再分配，展示了其在人道主义供应链中自适应集成学习的巨大社会影响潜力。

Abstract: Food banks are crucial for alleviating food insecurity, but their
effectiveness hinges on accurately forecasting highly volatile in-kind
donations to ensure equitable and efficient resource distribution. Traditional
forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to
unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and
natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in
the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and
dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and
contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally
distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by
wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by
hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly
during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and
adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent
to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant
potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for
humanitarian supply chains.

Conclusion: 研究表明可以利用先进学习方法（如联邦学习）在混合自动驾驶系统中实现自利驾驶代理的集体合作，为实际部署提供理论支持。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the
near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and
human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can
be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating
system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the
benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to
all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand
whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed
autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective
rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral
economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when
pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of
CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed
human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained
among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a
simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic
agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives.
Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates
the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the
emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based
on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging
advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective
cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

Conclusion: Craftax系列基准环境为MARL研究提供了有意义的挑战，有望推动该领域的长期发展，特别是在复杂合作和长期依赖方面。

Abstract: Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging
benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing
benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately
stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in
many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present
\textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment,
Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general
abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is
exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment
interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling
challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension
introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require
complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating
that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark,
including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and
argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk
prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal
dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack
of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder
or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional
embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to
preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is
trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and
substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving
the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the
depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms
the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the
Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key
clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal
inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific
medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified
by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk
assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In
summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease
risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that
demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on
themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups
of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between
multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and
property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if
it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property
value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over
the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient
algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a
hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property
$\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.
  In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property
$\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis
classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following
[GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when
given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$
$\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a
hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an
elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap
multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously
established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely
resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an

### [110] [Multi-agent Coordination via Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05005)
*Dongsu Lee,Daehee Lee,Amy Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAC-Flow是一个简单而富有表现力的多智能体协调框架，通过流式表示学习联合行为，并将其蒸馏为去中心化的一步策略，在保持协调能力的同时实现快速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有效协调的两个需求之间存在权衡：扩散方法能捕捉复杂协调但计算缓慢，高斯策略方法推理快但处理多智能体交互脆弱。需要解决这种性能与计算成本的权衡。

Method: 首先学习基于流的联合行为表示，然后将其蒸馏为去中心化的一步策略，这些策略保持了协调能力同时支持快速执行。

Result: 在4个基准测试（12个环境和34个数据集）上，MAC-Flow缓解了性能与计算成本的权衡，推理速度比基于扩散的MARL方法快约14.5倍，同时保持良好性能，推理速度与先前基于高斯策略的离线MARL方法相当。

Conclusion: MAC-Flow通过流式表示和策略蒸馏，成功解决了多智能体协调中性能与计算效率的权衡问题，提供了一种既表达力强又计算高效的协调框架。

Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for
multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination
are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present
in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However,
prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising
diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally
slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling
multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a
flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into
decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast
execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and
$34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and
computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$
faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining
good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of
prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
methods.

*Dongjin Park,Hasung Yeo,Joon-Woo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OvA-LP是一个用于联邦微调(FFT)的简约框架，通过线性探测和一对多头部设计，在源头抑制客户端数据异构导致的局部漂移问题，在极端非IID条件下保持95.9%的IID准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦微调方法在异构客户端分布下容易受到局部漂移的影响，导致全局模型出现系统性偏差和方差放大，现有的事后校正方法在极端非IID条件下表现脆弱。

Method: OvA-LP结合冻结编码器上的线性探测和一对多头部设计，采用简单的两阶段流程，保持预训练特征几何结构并解耦逻辑输出，防止漂移放大机制。

Result: 在CIFAR-100的100个客户端上，OvA-LP在shard-1、shard-2和Bernoulli-Dirichlet分区上平均保持了95.9%的IID准确率，而现有最佳方法PFPT和FFT-MoE分别只保持10.1%和34.5%。

Conclusion: OvA-LP为异构条件下的鲁棒联邦微调提供了原理性和高效的基础，在对称和非对称标签噪声下均保持弹性，且预计算编码器特征使每轮成本几乎与编码器大小无关。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data
but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local
drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and
amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and
personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle
under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework
that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at
its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing
on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure,
preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the
mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over
shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of
its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1%
(PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains
resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition,
precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of
encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a
principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.

TL;DR: 大多数现有的大语言模型遗忘方法在实践中无法实现真正的遗忘，当使用概率解码时，被遗忘的敏感信息会可靠地重新出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的遗忘对于监管合规和构建道德生成AI系统至关重要，以避免产生私人、有毒、非法或受版权保护的内容。

Method: 引入了leak@k元评估指标，量化在现实解码策略下生成k个样本时被遗忘知识重新出现的可能性，并在TOFU、MUSE和WMDP三个基准上进行了大规模系统研究。

Result: 发现知识泄漏在所有方法和任务中持续存在，表明当前最先进的遗忘技术仅提供有限的遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 当前的大语言模型遗忘方法存在严重漏洞，迫切需要开发更鲁棒的遗忘方法。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is critical for regulatory
compliance and for building ethical generative AI systems that avoid producing
private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content. Despite rapid progress, in
this work we show that \textit{almost all} existing unlearning methods fail to
achieve true forgetting in practice. Specifically, while evaluations of these
`unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest
successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the
literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models
are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this
vulnerability, we introduce \texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric
that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when
generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies.
Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the
first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly
defined \texttt{leak@$k$} metric. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge
leakage persists across methods and tasks, underscoring that current
state-of-the-art unlearning techniques provide only limited forgetting and
highlighting the urgent need for more robust approaches to LLM unlearning.

TL;DR: 本文分析了EM算法在二分量混合线性回归中的结构特性、摆线轨迹和非渐近收敛保证，特别关注未知混合权重和回归参数的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究在已知平衡权重和高信噪比情况下建立了EM算法的全局收敛性，但在完全未知参数设置下的理论行为仍不清楚，其轨迹和收敛阶数尚未完全表征。

Method: 推导了在所有信噪比情况下未知混合权重和回归参数的EM更新显式表达式，分析了结构特性和摆线轨迹。在无噪声情况下证明了回归参数轨迹形成摆线，在高信噪比情况下量化了与摆线轨迹的偏差。

Result: 轨迹分析揭示了收敛阶数：当EM估计与真实值几乎正交时为线性收敛，当估计与真实值夹角较小时为二次收敛。建立了有限样本水平上任意初始化的非渐近收敛保证。

Conclusion: 这项工作为分析混合线性回归中的EM算法提供了一个新颖的基于轨迹的框架。

Abstract: This work investigates the structural properties, cycloid trajectories, and
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown mixing
weights and regression parameters. Recent studies have established global
convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence
in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the
theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with
its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive
explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and
regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural
properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the
trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by
establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high
SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The
trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM
estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle
between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our
analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on
statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating
EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence
with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a
novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is crucial for
healthcare institutions. This study addresses the growing prevalence of
diabetes and its strong link to heart disease by proposing an efficient CVD
risk prediction model for diabetic patients using machine learning (ML) and
hybrid deep learning (DL) approaches. The BRFSS dataset was preprocessed by
removing duplicates, handling missing values, identifying categorical and
numerical features, and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature
extraction. Several ML models, including Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest
(RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and
XGBoost, were implemented, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy of
0.9050. Various DL models, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Deep
Neural Networks (DNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as hybrid models combining CNN with LSTM,
BiLSTM, and GRU, were also explored. Some of these models achieved perfect
recall (1.00), with the LSTM model achieving the highest accuracy of 0.9050.
Our research highlights the effectiveness of ML and DL models in predicting CVD

Abstract: The loss function used to train a neural network is strongly connected to its
output layer from a statistical point of view. This technical report analyzes
common activation functions for a neural network output layer, like linear,
sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, detailing their mathematical properties and their
appropriate use cases. A strong statistical justification exists for the
selection of the suitable loss function for training a deep learning model.
This report connects common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE),
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and various Cross-Entropy losses to the statistical
principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Choosing a specific loss
function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for the
model output, highlighting the link between these functions and the Generalized
Linear Models (GLMs) that underlie network output layers. Additional scenarios
of practical interest are also considered, such as alternative output
encodings, constrained outputs, and distributions with heavy tails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的方法生成多变量时间序列时速度慢且仅限于固定长度窗口，需要一种更高效灵活的生成方法。

Method: 将时间序列分解为捕获静态跨通道相关性的数据自适应基和时序系数，将系数向量量化为离散标记，使用LLaMA风格的自回归Transformer建模这些标记序列。

Result: FAR-TS比Diffusion-TS快几个数量级，同时保持了跨通道相关性和可解释的潜在空间，实现了高质量灵活的时间序列合成。

Conclusion: FAR-TS提供了一个简单有效的框架，能够快速生成任意长度的多变量时间序列，在保持数据质量的同时显著提升了生成效率。

Abstract: Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data
augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current
state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to
fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that
combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a
discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is
decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel
correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete
tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token
sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with
arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves
orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving
cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling
high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ROC-SVM在类别不平衡情况下直接最大化AUC，但计算成本高（O(n²)），限制了其实际应用。

Method: 使用不完全U统计量降低计算复杂度，并通过低秩核近似扩展到非线性分类，在再生核希尔伯特空间中实现高效训练。

Result: 理论分析证明了近似方法的误差界限，实验结果表明在合成和真实数据集上能达到与原始ROC-SVM相当的AUC性能，同时训练时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了ROC-SVM的计算瓶颈问题，为类别不平衡分类提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the
conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance.
However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training
involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a
scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby
substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the
framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation,
enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical
analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation,
and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM
with drastically reduced training time.

Motivation: NatureLM在生物声学基准测试中表现优异，但在处理复杂指令时（如同时请求通用名和学名）准确率显著下降，这揭示了领域特定微调与指令跟随灵活性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用简单的模型合并策略，将NatureLM与其基础语言模型进行插值融合，以最小化领域专业知识损失的同时恢复指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: 模型合并策略能够有效解决领域特定微调带来的指令跟随灵活性损失问题，同时保持甚至增强模型的领域专业知识和零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent
a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most
prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong
performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces
trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM
achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name
individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a
single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that
interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering
instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise.
Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot
generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new
state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.

Abstract: The financial industry faces a significant challenge modeling and risk
portfolios: balancing the predictability of advanced machine learning models,
neural network models, and explainability required by regulatory entities (such
as Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau). This paper intends to fill the gap in the application between these
"black box" models and explainability frameworks, such as LIME and SHAP.
Authors elaborate on the application of these frameworks on different models
and demonstrates the more complex models with better prediction powers could be
applied and reach the same level of the explainability, using SHAP and LIME.
Beyond the comparison and discussion of performances, this paper proposes a
novel five dimensional framework evaluating Inherent Interpretability, Global

Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume
spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically
powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic
deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook
how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream
model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from
additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts.
This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different
forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a
systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural
networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs),
and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under
varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world
temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are
effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate,
leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for
limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies
but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced.
Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively
learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights
for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All

Method: 从优化理论和特征学习角度研究深度扩展，提出零/一层渐进式训练方法，包括新层初始化、超参数迁移、学习率调度和模型扩展时机等关键技术。

Result: 在GPT2模型上，相比完全训练的60层7B参数模型，零/一层渐进式训练可节省约80%计算量，或等效加速约5倍，同时达到几乎相同的损失值。

Conclusion: 渐进式训练是实现计算效率与性能平衡的有效策略，特别适用于大规模模型训练，能够显著降低计算成本而不牺牲模型性能。

Abstract: Model depth is a double-edged sword in deep learning: deeper models achieve
higher accuracy but require higher computational cost. To efficiently train
models at scale, an effective strategy is the progressive training, which
scales up model capacity during training, hence significantly reducing
computation with little to none performance degradation. In this work, we study
the depth expansion of large models through the lens of optimization theory and
feature learning, offering insights on the initialization of new layers,
hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion.
Specifically, we propose zero/one-layer progressive training for the optimal
tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, zero/one-layer progressive
training on GPT2 can save $\approx 80\%$ compute, or equivalently accelerate
$\approx 5\times$ while achieving almost the same loss, compared to to a fully
trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters.

E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model that generates small
molecules by referencing both the original peptide binders and their
surrounding protein pocket environments. Trained on large datasets and
leveraging sophisticated modeling techniques, Peptide2Mol not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive generative tasks, but also
produces molecules with similarity to the original peptide binder.
Additionally, the model allows for molecule optimization and peptidomimetic
design through a partial diffusion process. Our results highlight Peptide2Mol
as an effective deep generative model for generating and optimizing bioactive
small molecules from protein binding pockets.

TL;DR: 提出一个综合混合框架，结合结构断点检测、小波信号去噪和深度学习模型，显著提升碳价格预测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳价格预测对能源市场决策至关重要，但由于政策干预和市场冲击导致的结构断点和高频噪声，现有方法缺乏系统性评估，限制了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Method: 集成Bai-Perron、ICSS和PELT算法进行结构断点检测，使用小波信号去噪，结合LSTM、GRU和TCN三种深度学习模型构建混合框架

Result: 提出的PELT-WT-TCN模型预测精度最高，相比最先进基线模型，RMSE降低22.35%，MAE降低18.63%；相比原始LSTM，RMSE降低70.55%，MAE降低74.42%

Conclusion: 将结构意识和多尺度分解集成到深度学习架构中，能显著提升碳价格预测及其他非平稳金融时间序列的准确性和可解释性

Abstract: Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market
decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective
decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural
breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and
market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches,
have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and
modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced
deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization
capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid
framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and
PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep
learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot
prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and
policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate
datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing
forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by
70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without
decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value
of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep
learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price
forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分层Actor-Critic深度强化学习框架来解决卡车-无人机协同旅行商问题(TSP-D)，该框架结合Transformer编码器和最小门控单元解码器，在训练效率和求解质量方面均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卡车-无人机协同系统在最后一公里物流中展现出巨大潜力，但TSP-D问题具有NP难的组合复杂性，传统优化方法难以有效解决，需要开发新的强化学习方法来应对这一挑战。

Method: 采用分层Actor-Critic深度强化学习框架，包含Transformer启发的编码器（使用优化的k近邻稀疏注意力机制）和高效的最小门控单元解码器，在异步优势Actor-Critic范式下运行。

Result: 在各种规模的基准TSP-D实例上(N=10到100)，该模型在更短的平均计算时间内获得竞争性甚至更优的解，相比先进强化学习算法基准显著减少了总训练时间。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在训练效率和最终性能方面均表现出显著优势，为TSP-D问题提供了一种高效的深度强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has
positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal
extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle
coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced
environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond
the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning
offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent
challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive
decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep
reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The
architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder
and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel,
optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for
focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration
of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded
representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire
framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.
Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales
(N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior
solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance
heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover,
compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed
framework significantly reduces the total training time required while
achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in
training efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is important for the
safe and effective implementation of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects.
This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation
for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with
machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$
injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that
uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the
diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve
covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation
(ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability
fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is
applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced
Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains
significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied,
while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical
implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty
quantification for risk assessment.

Abstract: Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular,
complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved
interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and
decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models
has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question
answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention.
To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA)
dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we
pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of
tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is
well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly
evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a
deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human
performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such
models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series
models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent
systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理偏好优化中的生产和评估成本问题，并考虑人类专家的感知模糊性，在相关场景下表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization allows optimization of objectives that are
either expensive or difficult to measure directly, by relying on a minimal
number of comparative evaluations done by a human expert. Generating candidate
solutions for evaluation is also often expensive, but this cost is ignored by
existing methods. We generalize preference-based optimization to explicitly
account for production and evaluation costs with Consecutive Preferential
Bayesian Optimization, reducing production cost by constraining comparisons to
involve previously generated candidates. We also account for the perceptual
ambiguity of the oracle providing the feedback by incorporating a
Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model to
capture indifference to small utility differences. We adapt an
information-theoretic acquisition strategy to this setting, selecting new
configurations that are most informative about the unknown optimum under a
preference model accounting for the perceptual ambiguity. We empirically
demonstrate a notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs
or with indifference feedback.

Conclusion: 该算法在上确界访问比和交互回合数方面达到了最优依赖关系，为在线离动态强化学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment
transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust
Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are
imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models
allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good
state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of
exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting
where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.
To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we
introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the
mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show
that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We
propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear
regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We
also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm
achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the
number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through comprehensive numerical experiments.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了实验室指标、影像学和多模态深度学习模型在预测PRRT治疗患者无进展生存期(PFS)方面的表现，发现结合SR-PET、CT和实验室生物标志物的多模态融合模型效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肽受体放射性核素治疗(PRRT)是转移性神经内分泌肿瘤的标准疗法，但仅有部分患者能获得长期疾病控制。预测PFS可支持个体化治疗规划。

Method: 回顾性单中心研究纳入116例接受177Lu-DOTATOC治疗的转移性神经内分泌肿瘤患者，收集临床特征、实验室指标和SR-PET/CT影像数据，训练7种模型（包括单模态和多模态融合方法）来分类低PFS与高PFS组。

Result: 多模态融合模型（结合实验室指标、SR-PET和CT，并增强预训练CT分支）表现最佳（AUROC 0.72±0.01，AUPRC 0.80±0.01），显著优于单模态模型。

Conclusion: 结合SR-PET、CT和实验室生物标志物的多模态深度学习在PRRT后PFS预测方面优于单模态方法，经外部验证后可能支持风险适应的随访策略。

Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for
metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs
only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could
support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory,
imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated
patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with
metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical
characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor
positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected.
Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including
unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches.
Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps.
Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1
year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline
chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT
cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only
on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal
three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed
worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion
model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch
- achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01).
Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers
outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external
validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.

Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational
challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly
critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure
reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new
fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual
learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together
with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in
class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid
conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay
(ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based
feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay
memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with
only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone
prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable,
real-world fault prediction in smart grids.

Conclusion: 生成系统易受隐蔽操纵，损害其统计完整性。作者检查了现有防御策略的局限性，并提出了新的对抗措施策略。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative models such as Stable Diffusion and
ChatGPT has made them increasingly attractive targets for malicious
exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Existing poisoning attacks
compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of
generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data
poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises
fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the
training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate
statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated
outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove
its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two
state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning
effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the
marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality
outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that
generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and
natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations
that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine
the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel
countermeasure strategy.

Conclusion: APP在保持电路发现质量的同时，显著降低了计算成本，为更高效的机制解释性分析提供了可行方案

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability
pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally
expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In
this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach
leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically
reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP
pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign
higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher
performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although
Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing
pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by
Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint
required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the
search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%.
Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads,
leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to
the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP
provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar
performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

Motivation: 研究流匹配方法的统计效率，将其与扩散模型的性能进行比较，为流匹配在分布估计中的理论保证提供严格分析。

Method: 通过推导流匹配分布近似的KL散度上界，建立L2流匹配损失与KL散度之间的定量关系，并分析在总变差距离下的统计收敛性质。

Result: 当L2流匹配损失有界于ε²时，KL散度被A₁ε + A₂ε²所界定，其中A₁和A₂仅依赖于数据和速度场的正则性。流匹配在估计光滑分布时达到近乎极小极大最优效率。

Conclusion: 流匹配在总变差距离下具有与扩散模型相当的统计效率，数值实验验证了理论结果，为流匹配方法提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular,
if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL
divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is
bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$
depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently,
this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers
under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves
nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our
results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of
diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and
learned velocities corroborate our theory.

Abstract: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme thermodynamic
stability (DDG) is fundamental to protein engineering and drug design. While
recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence
and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate
coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We
present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that
co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and
transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a
bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings
guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2)
transformer representations refine GNN message passing through
attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis
showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds
than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves
state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with
6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion
mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis
proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling,
with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work

TL;DR: ActiTect是一个全自动开源机器学习工具，用于从腕戴式活动记录仪检测快速眼动睡眠行为障碍(RBD)，在多个数据集上表现出强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: iRBD是α-突触核蛋白病的重要前驱标志，腕戴式活动记录仪在大规模筛查中具有潜力，但缺乏可靠高效的分析流程。

Method: 开发包含稳健预处理和自动睡眠-觉醒检测的流程，提取生理可解释的运动特征，使用机器学习模型识别RBD。

Result: 在78人队列中AUROC=0.95，在盲测集(n=31)AUROC=0.86，在两个独立外部队列中AUROC=0.84和0.94，跨数据集验证性能稳定。

Conclusion: ActiTect作为开源工具促进广泛采用，推动建立统一且可泛化的RBD检测模型。

Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major
prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical
onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system
atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting
RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements,
they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This
study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool
to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across
heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing
and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract
physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns.
Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong
discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was
confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two
independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To
assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the
internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range
= 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive
features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled
multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By
being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and
facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby
advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model
using wearable devices.

Conclusion: 该工作为现代生成模型与经典因果理论的融合提供了基础蓝图，为这一新兴领域建立了更严谨的标准

Abstract: Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for
counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of
latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex,
non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The
advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a
promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for
perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for
this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural
Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the
principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition
for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based
framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction
through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework,
a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid
Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity,
individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work
provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern
generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new
and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.

Motivation: 在电子健康记录时间序列预测任务中，平衡隐私保护与预测性能至关重要，需要解决成员推理攻击对模型隐私的威胁。

Method: 采用多种数据增强策略：Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO)、ZOO-PCA（主成分分析约束的ZOO变体）和MixUp，通过生成合成数据来增强模型抗攻击能力。

Result: 实验结果显示ZOO-PCA方法在降低成员推理攻击的TPR/FPR比率方面表现最佳，同时不会牺牲测试数据的预测性能。

Conclusion: 数据增强特别是ZOO-PCA方法能有效增强时间序列预测模型对成员推理攻击的抵抗力，在保护隐私的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is
critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health
Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate
Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with
synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by
reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key
challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original
training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to
enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple
augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO
constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to
strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental
results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA
attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAT（压缩与注意力变换器）通过使用密集注意力和压缩来解决transformer注意力计算成本高的问题，能够在测试时无需重新训练即可控制质量-计算权衡，在保持性能的同时实现1.4-3倍的速度提升和2-9倍的内存节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高效注意力方法（稀疏注意力、滑动窗口、卷积等）在减少计算和内存的同时往往牺牲了质量，特别是上下文回忆性能，且需要预先固定质量-计算权衡，无法适应不同下游应用的需求。

Method: CAT使用两个简单组件：密集注意力和压缩。通过将序列压缩成块，在解码时只关注压缩后的块，从而减少序列长度，实现计算和内存节省。支持多块大小训练，测试时可灵活调整质量-效率权衡。

Result: 在语言建模、上下文回忆和长上下文理解任务中，单个自适应CAT模型在不同计算-内存预算下均优于现有高效基线，包括混合架构。与密集transformer相比，在保持语言建模性能的同时速度提升1.4-3倍，总内存使用减少2-9倍。

Conclusion: CAT提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，通过压缩和注意力机制实现了质量与效率的灵活权衡，在保持性能的同时显著提升了transformer的效率。

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of
efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions
and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions
in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically
in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute
tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications
require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency
and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that
artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent
state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at
specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design
process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &
Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two
simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of
tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression
results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and
memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for
efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,
unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without
any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive
evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and
long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing
efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different
compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in
language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring
2-9x lower total memory usage.

Motivation: 电商平台的多模态产品检索系统需要有效结合视觉和文本信号，但现有视觉语言模型容易受到排版攻击的影响，导致预测偏差

Method: 提出一种新方法，将产品相关文本内容（如标题、描述）直接渲染到产品图像上，进行视觉-文本压缩，从而增强图像-文本对齐

Result: 在三个垂直电商数据集（运动鞋、手提包和交易卡）上使用六种最先进的视觉基础模型进行评估，实验显示在单模态和多模态检索准确率方面均获得一致提升

Conclusion: 在产品图像上视觉化渲染产品元数据是电商应用中零样本多模态检索的一种简单而有效的增强方法

Abstract: Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on
effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance
and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are
vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded
in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that
reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content
(e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform
vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and
boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on
three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading
cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval
accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that
visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for
zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

Conclusion: 该方法能够从输入-输出数据成功学习物理一致的模型，无需速度或动量测量，为模型预测控制等应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws,
in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent
models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work
incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to
obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical
principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is
rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with
non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem
setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme
for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP
hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping
coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take
advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for
computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is
evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a
state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

Motivation: 流匹配方法在数据驱动规划中表现出潜力，但缺乏对状态和动作约束的形式化保证，这是确保各种系统规划轨迹安全性和可接受性的基本要求。此外，现有流匹配规划器不保证动态一致性，可能导致轨迹无法执行。

Method: 通过在流中引入虚拟控制输入，利用非线性控制理论技术推导原则性指导，为状态约束、动作约束和动态一致性提供形式化保证。该方法无需重新训练，能够在测试时满足未见过的约束。

Result: 在多个任务上的广泛实验表明，SAD-Flower在确保约束满足方面优于各种基于生成模型的基线方法。

Conclusion: SAD-Flower框架成功解决了流匹配方法在约束保证方面的局限性，提供了一种无需重新训练即可生成安全、可接受且动态一致轨迹的有效方法。

Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning.
However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action
constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for
the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems.
Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which
potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by
proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and
Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of
the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be
derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal
guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency.
Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time
satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across
several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various
generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map

Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a
setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under
model uncertainty and adversarial corruption. We propose a clustered multitask
approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient
aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how
clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior
affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR
tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret
decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this
reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within
each cluster.

Abstract: Graph network-based simulators (GNS) have demonstrated strong potential for
learning particle-based physics (such as fluids, deformable solids, and
granular flows) while generalizing to unseen geometries due to their inherent
inductive biases. However, existing models are typically trained for a single
material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors,
limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular
flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning
mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify
that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early
message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of
constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information
propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the
first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test
performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this
insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)
conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This
approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or
moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and
0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short
simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data
reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method. Finally, we
validate the model's utility by applying it to an inverse problem, successfully
identifying unknown cohesion parameters from trajectory data. This approach
enables the use of GNS in inverse design and closed-loop control tasks where
material properties are treated as design variables.

Conclusion: Synapse框架成功利用了不同TSFMs的互补专长，通过动态仲裁机制显著提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant
advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex
characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range
dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting,
their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data
sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across
different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this
complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a
compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In
this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit
specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how
we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time
series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and
forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration
strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration
framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of
TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative,
context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by
adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models.
Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other
popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating
Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of clustering-based
approaches for self-supervised and unsupervised learning. However, the
application of clustering is often heuristic, and the optimal methodology
remains unclear. In this work, we establish connections between these

Through this framework, we demonstrate significant enhancements to these

Our method attains state-of-the-art performance across various self-supervised

resemblance to unseen ground truth labels, uncovering potential instances of
mislabeling.

Abstract: Accurate short-term precipitation forecasts predominantly rely on dense
weather-radar networks, limiting operational value in places most exposed to
climate extremes. We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned
Nowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike
most deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into
physically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion
and intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a
lead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable
advection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both
GOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,
Manaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics
over 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and
hybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in
most settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple
cities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest
degradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model
produces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical
flow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16. These
results indicate that physically aligned learning can provide nowcasts that are
skillful, transferable and global.

Abstract: Precision agriculture demands continuous and accurate monitoring of soil
moisture (M) and key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
and potassium (K), to optimize yields and conserve resources. Wireless soil
sensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current
solutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to
handle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and
organic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce
SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key
components: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX
eliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates
Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the
Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle
cross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral
antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure
soil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5%
over baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.
