*Emanuel Garbin,Guy Adam,Oded Krams,Zohar Barzelay,Eran Guendelman,Michael Schwarz,Moran Vatelmacher,Yigal Shenkman,Eli Peker,Itai Druker,Uri Patish,Yoav Blum,Max Bluvstein,Junxuan Li,Rawal Khirodkar,Shunsuke Saito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从少量非结构化手机图像创建超真实、保持身份特征的3D头像的零样本流水线，通过生成式规范化模块和基于transformer的模型解决现有方法的几何不一致和细节缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临单视图几何不一致和幻觉问题，以及合成数据训练模型无法捕捉高频细节（如皮肤皱纹和细发）的局限性，影响真实感和身份保持。

Method: 引入两个关键贡献：(1) 生成式规范化模块，将多个非结构化视图处理为标准化的、一致的表示；(2) 基于transformer的模型，在从真实人物圆顶捕捉获得的高斯溅射头像大规模数据集上训练。采用"捕捉、规范化、溅射"流水线。

Result: 该流水线从非结构化照片中生成具有引人注目的真实感和强大身份保持能力的静态四分之一身体头像。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式规范化和大规模高质量数据集训练，成功解决了现有3D头像创建方法在几何一致性和高频细节捕捉方面的挑战，实现了超真实且身份保持的3D头像生成。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

### [2] [GauSSmart: Enhanced 3D Reconstruction through 2D Foundation Models and Geometric Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14270)
*Alexander Valverde,Brian Xu,Yuyin Zhou,Meng Xu,Hongyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GauSSmart是一种混合方法，将2D基础模型与3D高斯溅射重建相结合，通过2D分割先验和特征嵌入指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化，提升场景重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯溅射在大规模数据集上表现良好，但在稀疏覆盖区域难以捕捉细节或保持真实感，主要受限于稀疏3D训练数据的固有局限。

Method: 集成2D计算机视觉技术（凸滤波和DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督），利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化。

Result: 在三个数据集上的验证表明，GauSSmart在大多数评估场景中持续优于现有高斯溅射方法。

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有显著潜力，2D基础模型与3D重建管道的精心组合可以克服各自方法的固有局限。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

### [3] [Inpainting the Red Planet: Diffusion Models for the Reconstruction of Martian Environments in Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14765)
*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无条件扩散模型的方法来重建火星表面高度图，填补卫星数据中的缺失值，相比传统方法在重建精度和感知相似性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星探测依赖虚拟现实技术，但火星地形数据存在大量缺失值，传统插值方法难以保持几何一致性，需要更先进的重建方法。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在12000个火星高度图增强数据集上训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，最终固定为128x128分辨率。

Result: 与逆距离加权、克里金法和纳维-斯托克斯算法等传统方法相比，该方法在重建精度（RMSE提升4-15%）和感知相似性（LPIPS提升29-81%）方面均表现更优。

Conclusion: 无条件扩散模型能够有效重建火星表面地形，填补数据缺失，为空间探索提供更可靠的地形模拟数据。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

### [4] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat是一个用于零样本食物识别的对话驱动多智能体推理框架，通过整合视觉语言模型和大语言模型实现多轮视觉-文本对话协作推理，无需额外训练或标注即可识别未见过的食物类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督模型严重依赖大规模标注数据集，对未见食物类别的泛化能力有限。需要开发无需标注就能识别新食物类别的智能方法。

Method: 采用多智能体对话框架，包含对象感知令牌(OPT)捕获细粒度视觉属性，交互式推理智能体(IRA)动态解释上下文线索来优化预测，通过多轮视觉-文本对话实现协作推理。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，MultiFoodChat相比现有无监督和少样本方法获得了更优的识别准确率和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为智能食品质量检测和分析新范式的潜力，能够灵活、类人地理解复杂食物场景。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

### [5] [Ponimator: Unfolding Interactive Pose for Versatile Human-human Interaction Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14976)
*Shaowei Liu,Chuan Guo,Bing Zhou,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的动画生成框架，使用两个条件扩散模型从交互姿态生成动态运动序列或合成交互姿态，支持多种交互动画任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近距离人-人交互姿态蕴含丰富的交互动态信息，人类能从中推断上下文并预测过去未来动态。受此启发，作者希望利用交互姿态先验来实现通用的交互动画。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；姿态生成器利用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。

Result: 实验表明姿态先验具有普适性，框架在各种数据集和应用中表现出有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator能够将高质量动作捕捉数据中的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景，支持基于图像的交互动画、反应动画和文本到交互合成等多样化任务。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症具有多样化的视觉表现，识别困难且容易出错，特别是对于非专科医生。该系统旨在为妇科医生提供辅助诊断工具

Method: 训练了一个能够分割深色子宫内膜植入物的系统，该系统可以分析腹腔镜手术视频，用多色叠加标注识别出的植入区域，并显示检测摘要以改善视频浏览

Result: 系统成功实现了对深色子宫内膜植入物的自动分割和标注功能

Conclusion: 该系统为子宫内膜异位症的诊断提供了有效的辅助工具，有助于提高识别准确性和视频浏览效率

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [7] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究结合传统视觉模型和视觉语言模型来提升遥感图像分析，特别是在飞机检测和场景理解方面，在挑战性条件下取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据量大幅增长，但传统视觉模型需要大量标注数据且难以理解复杂环境中的上下文信息，视觉语言模型在遥感领域的应用仍待探索。

Method: 将YOLO与LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini等视觉语言模型结合，在标注和未标注遥感数据以及退化图像场景下进行评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数方面平均MAE提升48.46%，在原始和退化场景下均有改进；CLIPScore提升6.17%用于遥感图像综合理解。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型的结合为更先进高效的遥感图像分析铺平了道路，特别是在少样本学习场景中。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于深度学习的AI系统，用于检测前列腺癌中的筛状形态，该系统在内部和外部验证中表现出色，甚至超过了9位专家病理学家的诊断一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是预后不良的组织学特征，但存在报告不足和观察者间变异性的问题，需要更可靠的检测方法。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习的深度学习模型，在640个前列腺穿刺活检切片上进行训练，并在多个队列中进行内部和外部验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中AUC达0.97，Cohen's kappa为0.81；在外部验证中AUC为0.90，Cohen's kappa为0.55；在专家比较中模型一致性最高(kappa=0.66)，优于所有9位病理学家(kappa范围0.35-0.62)。

Conclusion: 该AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到病理学家水平，可提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [9] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NAPPure框架，扩展了对抗净化方法以处理非加性对抗扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲），而不仅仅是传统的加性扰动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，但在现实世界中非加性扰动也很常见，现有方法对此效果不佳。

Method: 建立对抗图像的生成过程，通过似然最大化分离底层干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架成功扩展了对抗净化的适用范围，能够有效处理非加性对抗扰动。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [10] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent是一个基于图的检索-推理增强生成框架，通过结构化图表示视频和中间推理步骤，解决长视频理解中时间依赖中断和无关信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临处理密集视频标记超出上下文窗口和保留长期序列信息的挑战，现有检索增强生成方法在视频中会破坏时间依赖并包含无关信息。

Method: 使用结构化图表示视频片段间的语义关系，引入中间推理步骤进行结构化验证以减少检索噪声，并显式聚合跨片段的相关信息。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，相比基础模型性能提升3.0%~5.4%，优于最先进的视频RAG方法8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent框架通过图结构和中间推理有效增强了大型视频语言模型的长视频理解能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL是一种基于原型的时间同步框架，通过构建共享的紧凑1D表示来对齐不同场景或生成AI视频，无需穷举成对匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步来自不同场景或生成AI视频的复杂挑战，由于主题、背景多样性和非线性时间错位，传统简单时间偏移方法无法有效处理。

Method: 提出时间原型学习(TPL)框架，从预训练模型提取的高维嵌入中构建共享的紧凑1D表示，通过学习统一原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段。

Result: 实验显示TPL在多个数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，包括细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务，是首个解决多生成AI视频同步问题的方法。

Conclusion: TPL框架有效解决了复杂视频同步问题，特别是在生成AI视频场景中表现优异，提供了新的多视频同步数据集和代码实现。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

*Alexandr A. Kalinin,Anne E. Carpenter,Shantanu Singh,Matthew J. O'Meara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源的Python库，通过为SciPy和scikit-image API提供GPU加速的替代方案，解决了生物图像分析中的可扩展性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的大型2D和3D数据集使得现有计算方法在可扩展性、效率以及与科学计算工作流集成方面存在局限。现有工具缺乏API支持、GPU加速、3D处理能力，且互操作性差。

Method: cubic基于CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM，为广泛使用的SciPy和scikit-image API提供设备无关的GPU加速替代方案，自动将操作分派到GPU或CPU执行。

Result: 通过基准测试和现有去卷积与分割流程的复现，cubic实现了显著的速度提升，同时保持算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重现的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，能与更广泛的Python科学计算生态系统集成，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析工作流。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

Result: 在自我介绍视频数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合建模Big Five和HEXACO，提高了对多模态人类行为的认知能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

Conclusion: 该方法通过位平面噪声特征提取和高效分类设计，实现了高精度、高效率的AI生成图像检测，具有优异的跨生成器泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

Motivation: 传统检测方法依赖手动设计的音素-视位对齐阈值、基本帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由先进生成模型（如GANs、扩散模型和神经渲染技术）生成的现代深度伪造内容。

Method: 使用音素序列、唇部几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入，通过多模态融合来识别跨多个互补模态的不一致性。

Result: 该集成方法显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态分析有效解决了传统检测方法在识别现代深度伪造技术生成内容时的局限性。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Motivation: 传统基于帧的OCC系统存在比特率低和处理负载高的问题，而现有的事件视觉传感器OCC系统使用的传统调制方案未能充分利用EVS的独特特性。

Method: 提出了事件间隔调制(EIM)方案，通过调制事件之间的间隔来编码信息；优化EVS参数以适配EIM，实验确定最大调制阶数，并进行传输实验。

Conclusion: EIM方案能够充分利用事件视觉传感器的特性，显著提高了光学相机通信系统的传输性能，为高速、低延迟的可见光通信提供了新方法。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高的问题，传统场景坐标回归方法在扩展到大规模场景时受限于单个网络的容量。

Method: 引入门控网络隐式分类和选择子网络，每次推理只激活单个子网络；提出无辅助损失负载均衡策略(ALF-LB)提升定位精度。

Conclusion: MACE框架为大规模场景应用提供了高效的解决方案，在降低计算成本的同时实现了高精度定位和渲染。

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性方面存在困难，特别是当人脸在图像中占比较小且表情动作变化较大时，这个问题尤为关键

Method: 基于强化学习的身份保持奖励引导优化框架，使用人脸身份评分器优化扩散模型，通过反向传播奖励信号和KL散度正则化来稳定训练

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效提升图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性，无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Method: 构建基于大规模偏好数据集的视频奖励模型，包含人工标注和合成失真数据，采用针对多人物一致性的GRPO变体来优化VACE和Phantom模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为强化学习与个性化视频生成的结合提供了可行的见解，显著提升了多人物身份保持能力。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率图像跨视图匹配的挑战，现有交叉注意力机制存在二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的问题。

Method: 提出MatchAttention机制，使用BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样，通过残差连接迭代更新相对位置，设计MatchDecoder作为核心组件，并引入门控交叉MatchAttention和一致性约束损失来处理遮挡问题。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中平均误差排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T仅用3GB GPU内存在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像；在KITTI 2012、KITTI 2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 结合高精度和低计算复杂度，实现了实时、高分辨率、高精度的跨视图匹配。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN能生成高质量合成眼部图像，有效解决虹膜生物识别中的数据稀缺问题，提升演示攻击检测能力。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Conclusion: VaCo通过视觉中心激活和协调有效解决了MLLM中视觉信息被忽视的问题，显著提升了模型的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Conclusion: SPR方法通过空间偏好奖励机制成功提升了多模态大语言模型的细粒度空间感知能力，为解决MLLM在空间理解方面的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

*Dongnam Byun,Jungwon Park,Jumgmin Ko,Changin Choi,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOS方法通过修改CLIP文本嵌入来改善多对象图像生成，解决对象遗漏和混合问题，在人类评估中显著优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理多对象提示时经常出现对象遗漏或对象混合的问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象等四种场景下。

Method: 提出DOS（方向性对象分离）方法，在将文本输入到文本到图像模型之前修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示DOS持续提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。在人类评估中，DOS显著优于四种竞争方法，在四个基准测试中获得26.24%-43.04%更多的投票。

Conclusion: DOS是改善多对象图像生成的一个实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DRBD-Mamba模型，通过双分辨率双向Mamba架构实现高效3D脑肿瘤分割，在保持高精度的同时提升15倍效率，并在BraTS2023数据集上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Mamba模型在脑肿瘤分割中计算开销大、多轴特征扫描效率低的问题，并填补现有方法在BraTS数据分区鲁棒性评估方面的空白。

Method: 使用空间填充曲线进行3D到1D特征映射保持空间局部性，提出门控融合模块自适应整合前后向上下文，采用量化块离散化特征提升鲁棒性，并建立五个系统性折叠进行严格评估。

Result: 在测试集上，全肿瘤、肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤的Dice分别提升0.10%、1.75%和0.93%；在系统性五折评估中，肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤平均Dice分别提升0.86%和1.45%，同时效率提升15倍。

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba模型在脑肿瘤分割中实现了精度和效率的良好平衡，具有较强的鲁棒性和计算优势，为临床诊断提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

TL;DR: BoardVision是一个用于检测主板装配级缺陷的可复现框架，通过集成YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN模型，提出轻量级集成方法CTV Voter来平衡精度和召回率，并评估了在真实扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在电子制造中，主板缺陷检测对确保可靠性至关重要。虽然PCB检测研究主要针对裸板或线路级缺陷，但装配级全主板检测仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出BoardVision框架，基准测试YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN，设计轻量级集成方法Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter)，并评估在锐度、亮度和方向变化等扰动下的鲁棒性。

Result: YOLO在精度上表现出色但在召回率上表现不佳，Faster R-CNN则相反。CTV Voter通过可解释规则平衡了精度和召回率。在真实扰动下存在稳定性挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了计算机视觉技术如何从基准结果过渡到实际的主板装配制造质量保证，并发布了可部署的GUI驱动检测工具。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学面临全切片图像计算量大和标注稀缺的挑战，现有方法常忽略多放大倍率下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用易到难的渐进表示学习，结合双课程对比多实例学习框架，直接处理千兆像素级全切片图像进行预后预测。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954名患者，1254万个图块）上验证，DCMIL优于标准WSI预后模型，能识别细粒度预后相关区域并提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: DCMIL无需密集标注即可有效处理全切片图像，识别预后关键区域，捕捉正常与肿瘤组织形态差异，具有生成新生物学见解的潜力。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一帧内和帧间编码的神经视频压缩框架，通过自适应帧内/帧间编码和双向帧间压缩设计，解决了现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容和帧间误差传播方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案存在处理遮挡和新内容效率低、帧间误差传播累积等问题，借鉴传统视频编码中允许帧内编码的思想来解决这些限制。

Method: 提出统一帧内和帧间编码的NVC框架，每个帧由单一模型处理，自适应执行帧内/帧间编码；同时采用双向两帧压缩设计，充分利用前后帧间的冗余信息。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方案相比DCVC-RT平均降低10.7% BD-rate，提供更稳定的每帧码率和质量，同时保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的统一帧内/帧间编码框架有效解决了现有NVC方案的局限性，在压缩效率和稳定性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于深度学习的视频目标检测器在安全关键应用中很重要，但它们容易受到对抗攻击，特别是通用扰动攻击。

Method: 使用核范数正则化促进背景集中的结构化扰动，并采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化。

Result: 所提出的攻击在有效性上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe攻击，同时保持高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频目标检测提供了一种有效且隐蔽的通用对抗攻击方案，所有代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型虽然能同时处理多种图像退化问题，但参数量过大导致计算效率低下。需要找到在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数的方法。

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，在多轮中移除低幅值权重，并将剩余权重重置为原始初始化，从而发现高性能的稀疏子网络（"中奖彩票"）。

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务上的实验表明，MIR-L仅保留10%的可训练参数，同时保持高水平的图像恢复性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功证明了在多任务图像恢复模型中，通过迭代剪枝可以发现高度稀疏但性能优异的子网络，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧活动同时影响农业生产和生物多样性，但目前缺乏可扩展的放牧监测方法。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据，为每个多边形定义的田块边界，使用4-10月影像进行二元预测（放牧/未放牧），训练CNN-LSTM集成模型处理多时相反射特征。

Result: 模型在五个验证分割上平均F1得分为77%，放牧牧场召回率90%；在检查资源有限（每年最多检查4%场地）的情况下，优先检查模型预测为未放牧的田块，相比随机检查可多确认17.2倍的未放牧场地。

Conclusion: 粗分辨率、免费可用的卫星数据能够可靠地指导检查资源分配，用于保护导向的土地利用合规监测。

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

Motivation: Vision Mamba在图像分类中表现出优于Vision Transformers和CNN的计算效率和参数效率，其网络规模随输入图像分辨率线性增长而非二次增长，这使其在三维多孔介质渗透率预测任务中具有潜在优势。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为骨干网络构建神经网络模型，用于三维多孔介质渗透率预测。通过消融研究评估各组件对精度的影响，并与ViT和CNN模型进行多方面的性能比较。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViT。作者公开了源代码以促进可重复性和后续研究。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

Abstract: Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical
integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical
complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing
often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and
inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection
framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects
in real-time, ensuring high accuracy and industrial scalability. The model is
trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument
types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against
state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种噪声投影器，通过文本条件优化将初始噪声映射到更适合预训练Stable Diffusion模型的提示感知噪声，从而改善文本-图像对齐，无需修改SD模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中的训练-推理不匹配问题：训练时噪声位于提示特定的子空间，而推理时从提示无关的高斯先验采样，导致图像与提示对齐不佳。

Method: 使用噪声投影器对初始噪声进行文本条件优化，通过视觉语言模型获取反馈并蒸馏到奖励模型中，最后通过准直接偏好优化优化噪声投影器。

Result: 实验表明该方法能显著提高不同提示下的文本-图像对齐质量，且推理成本低。

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知噪声投影方法有效解决了训练-推理不匹配问题，提升了文本到图像生成的对齐性能。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: In this report, we propose PaddleOCR-VL, a SOTA and resource-efficient model
tailored for document parsing. Its core component is PaddleOCR-VL-0.9B, a
compact yet powerful vision-language model (VLM) that integrates a NaViT-style
dynamic resolution visual encoder with the ERNIE-4.5-0.3B language model to
enable accurate element recognition. This innovative model efficiently supports
109 languages and excels in recognizing complex elements (e.g., text, tables,
formulas, and charts), while maintaining minimal resource consumption. Through
comprehensive evaluations on widely used public benchmarks and in-house
benchmarks, PaddleOCR-VL achieves SOTA performance in both page-level document
parsing and element-level recognition. It significantly outperforms existing
solutions, exhibits strong competitiveness against top-tier VLMs, and delivers
fast inference speeds. These strengths make it highly suitable for practical
deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

*Keima Abe,Hayato Muraki,Shuhei Tomoshige,Kenichi Oishi,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA是一个用于医学图像领域协调和可解释表示学习的框架，通过伪线性风格编码器对抗域适应方法，在保持疾病相关信息的同时解决MRI扫描中的领域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像（如MRI扫描）在不同成像站点间存在领域偏移，导致机器学习性能下降。现有方法虽然有效但缺乏可解释性，这在医疗应用中至关重要。

Method: 使用两个编码器f_E和f_SE分别提取领域不变特征z_u和领域特定特征z_d，通过解码器重构图像，并采用对抗训练确保特征解耦。通过将z_u和z_d的重构相加来重建输入图像。

Result: 与现有方法相比，PL-SE-ADA在图像重建、疾病分类和领域识别方面达到相当或更好的性能，同时能够可视化领域无关和领域特定的脑部特征。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA提供了一个高度可解释的领域协调框架，在保持性能的同时解决了医疗应用中可解释性的关键需求。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Motivation: 深度学习在图像理解方面取得了显著进展，但其内部表示通常不透明，难以解释视觉信息处理过程。相比之下，经典视觉描述符对人类来说直观易懂。研究现代学习是否能从这些经典线索中受益。

Method: 提出VisualSplit框架，将图像显式分解为解耦的经典描述符，每个描述符作为视觉知识的独立但互补组件。采用重建驱动的预训练方案，学习捕捉每个视觉描述符的本质同时保持其可解释性。

Result: 通过显式分解视觉属性，该方法在各种高级视觉任务中（包括图像生成和编辑）实现了有效的属性控制，超越了传统的分类和分割任务。

Conclusion: 这种新的学习方法在视觉理解方面表现出有效性，为现代学习从经典视觉线索中受益提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法都是单步调整，对于特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集不够充分，需要多步调整能力来实现更精确的跨模态对齐。

Method: 提出FMA方法：1) 使用固定耦合策略确保类别对应；2) 噪声增强策略缓解数据稀缺问题；3) 早停求解器提高效率和精度。通过学习跨模态速度场实现多步调整。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干网络上，FMA都能带来显著性能提升，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FMA具有多步修正能力，能够实现更精确和鲁棒的跨模态对齐，在复杂数据集上优于现有的单步参数高效微调方法。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC)的训练自由提示嵌入编辑方法，通过抑制文本到图像生成中固有的场景-ID相关性来解决身份偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要预先知道所有目标场景，这在现实中不切实际。研究发现身份偏移的主要原因是T2I模型在拟合自然图像训练分布时产生的场景上下文化现象。

Method: 通过量化SVD方向稳定性来自适应重新加权相应特征值，识别并抑制ID提示嵌入中的潜在场景-ID相关性，实现场景去上下文化。

Result: 实验表明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC提供了一种高效、灵活且通用的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用，无需预先了解所有目标场景。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

TL;DR: BalanceGS是一种算法-系统协同设计方法，通过启发式工作负载敏感的高斯密度控制、基于相似性的高斯采样与合并、以及基于重排序的内存访问映射策略，解决了3D高斯泼溅训练中的三个关键效率问题，实现了1.44倍的训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅训练存在三个关键效率问题：高斯致密化过程中的密度分配不均、高斯投影过程中的计算负载不平衡、以及颜色泼溅过程中的内存访问碎片化。

Method: 1. 算法层面：提出启发式工作负载敏感的高斯密度控制，自动平衡点分布；2. 系统层面：提出基于相似性的高斯采样与合并，用自适应工作负载分配替代静态线程-像素映射；3. 映射层面：提出基于重排序的内存访问映射策略，重构RGB存储并启用共享内存中的批量加载。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上，与3DGS相比，该方法实现了1.44倍的训练加速，且质量下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3D高斯泼溅训练中的效率瓶颈，显著提升了训练速度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位开辟了新的应用可能性

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成在保持连贯物体运动和交互方面存在困难，主要瓶颈包括：人类提供的运动提示在编码后有效token过少，以及单头优化倾向于纹理而非时间一致性。

Method: 1. 实例线索：将稀疏的用户可编辑提示转换为密集的2.5D运动场；2. 密集RoPE：在token空间中保持提示的显著性；3. 联合RGB+辅助图预测。

Result: 该方法减少了深度模糊性，稳定了优化过程，提高了时间一致性。

Conclusion: STANCE框架通过简单组件有效解决了视频生成中的运动一致性问题，无需复杂的逐帧轨迹脚本。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

*Ning Ding,Keisuke Fujii,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shot2Tactic-Caption是一个羽毛球视频多尺度字幕生成框架，能够生成描述单个动作的击球级字幕和描述战术执行过程的战术级字幕。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 羽毛球战术理解不仅需要解释单个动作，还需要理解战术如何随时间动态执行。现有方法缺乏对战术层面动态过程的描述能力。

Method: 采用双分支设计，包括视觉编码器、时空Transformer编码器和基于Transformer的解码器。引入战术单元检测器识别有效战术单元、类型和状态，并使用击球级提示引导机制将预测的战术类型和状态作为提示注入解码器。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在生成击球和战术字幕方面有效。消融研究显示基于ResNet50的时空编码器优于其他变体，击球级提示结构化能产生更连贯准确的战术字幕。

Conclusion: Shot2Tactic-Caption框架能够有效生成羽毛球视频的多尺度语义和时序字幕，特别是通过击球级提示引导机制能够描述成功执行的战术以及被中断后恢复的战术执行过程。

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS是一种简单即插即用的视频采样方法，通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁来减少视频中的令牌冗余，显著降低令牌数量同时保持语义保真度，实现更快推理和更长输入序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从静态图像理解扩展到视频推理时，处理密集帧序列的二次成本限制了其可扩展性。长视频经常超过现代语言模型的令牌预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: EVS通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁（在连续帧中保持不变的空间区域）来减少视频令牌冗余。该方法保持位置身份，无需架构更改或重新训练。

Result: EVS在推理时将大型语言模型的首次令牌时间减少高达4倍，且精度损失最小。结合随机修剪率的上训练阶段，EVS产生对不同程度压缩具有鲁棒性的模型，并在激进修剪下保持完整性能。

Conclusion: EVS持续改进效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

*Ming Gui,Johannes Schusterbauer,Timy Phan,Felix Krause,Josh Susskind,Miguel Angel Bautista,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器生成的单个连续潜在令牌来表示图像，通过微调语义令牌嵌入和生成解码器实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，降低训练成本，同时探索微调自监督表示作为紧凑有效潜在空间的潜力。

Method: 基于预训练的SSL编码器，仅微调语义令牌嵌入，配合使用流匹配目标的生成解码器，添加余弦相似度损失保持原始SSL空间的几何特性。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上以极有限的训练预算达到竞争性的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 微调的自监督表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，用于高效的生成建模。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteeringTTA是一种基于Feynman-Kac引导的测试时适应框架，通过扩散模型引导输入适应，无需模型更新或源数据，在ImageNet-C上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于扩散的测试时适应方法依赖梯度引导，限制了跨失真类型探索和泛化能力的问题。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导机制，通过伪标签驱动的奖励来引导扩散过程，维护多个粒子轨迹，结合累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索与置信度。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA始终优于不进行任何模型更新或使用源数据的基线方法。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA提供了一种有效的推理时适应框架，能够在不更新模型的情况下提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本预训练策略，通过上下文学习从无配对视频片段中学习视频编辑能力，显著提升了基于指令的视频编辑性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的图像编辑发展迅速，但扩展到视频领域面临挑战，主要由于构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集成本高昂且复杂。

Method: 利用无配对视频片段进行上下文学习预训练，赋予基础视频生成模型通用编辑能力，然后使用少量高质量配对编辑数据进行微调。

Result: 在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面超越现有方法，编辑指令遵循度提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该预训练策略有效解决了视频编辑数据集稀缺问题，为基于指令的视频编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: 将去相关反向传播（DBP）集成到MAE预训练中，通过减少层间输入相关性来加速收敛，在保持稳定性的同时减少21.1%的训练时间和21.4%的碳排放，并提升下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE预训练在低标签场景下表现优异，但计算成本高昂，难以在时间和资源受限的工业环境中应用

Method: 在MAE预训练的选择性编码器中集成DBP优化方法，迭代减少每层的输入相关性以加速收敛

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练和ADE20K微调中，DBP-MAE将达到基线性能的挂钟时间减少21.1%，碳排放降低21.4%，分割mIoU提高1.1个百分点。在工业数据上也观察到类似增益

Conclusion: DBP能够在大规模ViT预训练中减少训练时间和能源使用，同时提升下游任务性能，适用于实际工业场景

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的重要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度和地理范围上有限，需要长期一致的采矿诱发地表变化监测来支持可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像构建EuroMineNet数据集，支持两个任务：多时序采矿足迹制图（使用新的Change-Aware Temporal IoU指标评估）和跨时序变化检测。对20个最先进的深度学习模型进行了基准测试。

Result: GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测对及时缓解至关重要的短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致且可解释的采矿监测，有助于可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性，以及将GeoAI应用于社会和环境福祉的更广泛目标。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏依赖强教师模型或大数据集，在现实有限数据场景下效果受限，存在知识退化、监督效率低等问题。

Method: 构建弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络，形成渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型既学习前驱知识又精炼后传递，仅需部分数据集训练。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上超越现有监督方法，在其他两个数据集上验证了跨医学成像模态的泛化能力，相比单骨干网络在有限数据下准确率提升最高达23%。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过结构化知识传递有效减少数据依赖，在有限监督下实现高效学习，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了组合性和可解释的推理过程，为视频理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅压缩技术虽然减少了存储开销，但缺乏学习先验限制了率失真性能的进一步提升。需要利用学习图像先验来恢复压缩引起的质量退化。

Method: 基于初始压缩的高斯，构建恢复网络在图像空间中建模压缩伪影，引入粗渲染残差作为边信息，通过恢复图像的监督来细化压缩高斯。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容现有的高斯压缩方法，能够实现高度紧凑的表示并提升渲染性能，为3DGS压缩提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open

Method: CFSAM包含三个组件：卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元（高效捕获跨层交互）、特征融合机制（恢复和增强原始表征）

Result: 在SSD300框架中集成CFSAM后，PASCAL VOC上mAP达78.6%（基线75.5%），COCO上mAP达52.1%（基线43.1%），优于现有注意力模块，且加速训练收敛

Conclusion: 显式的跨层注意力建模对于推进多尺度目标检测具有重要意义

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

Result: 提出的方法和强基线在混合监督下显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准测试和相应方法推动了在现实约束下的层次分类研究进展。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

TL;DR: DEXTER是一个无需数据的框架，使用扩散模型和大型语言模型生成视觉分类器的全局文本解释，通过优化文本提示合成激活目标分类器的类别条件图像，并生成详细的语言报告来描述类别特定的决策模式和偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解和解释机器学习模型的行为对于构建透明和可信赖的AI系统至关重要，但现有方法通常需要训练数据或真实标签，限制了其应用范围。

Method: DEXTER通过优化文本提示来合成类别条件图像，这些图像能强烈激活目标分类器，然后使用合成样本来生成详细的自然语言报告，描述类别特定的决策模式和偏见。

Result: 在ImageNet、Waterbirds、CelebA和FairFaces上的实验表明，DEXTER在全局模型解释和类别级别偏见报告方面优于现有方法，定量和定性评估（包括用户研究）显示其产生准确、可解释的输出。

Conclusion: DEXTER提供了一个无需训练数据或真实标签的灵活框架，能够有效揭示视觉分类器的内部机制，在激活最大化、切片发现与去偏见以及偏见解释等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LightQANet框架，通过量化特征学习和自适应提示机制解决低光图像增强中的纹理恢复、颜色一致性和伪影问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法由于像素级信息严重退化，难以提取可靠特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影问题。

Method: 提出LightQANet框架：1) 静态建模：设计光量化模块(LQM)显式提取和量化光照相关因子；2) 动态适应：引入光感知提示模块(LAPM)将光照先验编码为可学习提示，动态指导特征学习。

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种挑战性光照场景下均获得优越的定性和定量结果，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化特征学习和自适应提示机制，能够有效提升低光图像增强质量，实现跨不同光照条件的一致和鲁棒图像质量。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

*Hojun Choi,Youngsun Lim,Jaeyo Shin,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL是一个新的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过引入视觉链式思维推理和对比背景学习，在拥挤或遮挡场景中显著提升新类别的伪标签质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放词汇目标检测方法过度依赖直接图像-文本匹配，忽视了理解语义复杂场景所需的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景中鲁棒性有限。

Method: CoT-PL将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本类别识别和背景定位，并引入对比背景学习来促进目标与背景的特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类别伪标签质量分别比之前最佳方法提升了103.4%和168.4%；在开放词汇COCO上AP50提升7.7，在LVIS上新类别mask AP提升2.9，达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: CoT-PL通过结构化视觉链式思维推理和对比背景学习，显著提升了开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景中的鲁棒性和性能，特别是在处理新类别时表现优异。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

TL;DR: 开发了PRISM模型，一种可解释的AI模型，通过整合连续变异谱来表征结直肠癌的形态多样性，在5年总生存期预测上表现优异，超越现有方法15-23%的准确率。


<details>

Motivation: 当前计算病理学的基础模型往往忽略器官特异性关键形态模式，而这些模式代表不同的生物过程，能从根本上影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后。

Method: PRISM模型整合了每个独特形态内的连续变异谱来表征表型多样性，基于424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像进行训练。

Result: PRISM在5年总生存期预测上表现优异（AUC=0.70，准确率68.37%，HR=3.34），比现有结直肠癌特定方法准确率高15%，比AI基础模型高约23%。模型在性别间表现稳健，在临床病理亚组中性能稳定。

Conclusion: PRISM模型成功捕捉了结直肠癌的形态多样性，提供了优越的预后预测性能，证明了整合连续变异谱方法在计算病理学中的价值。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super是一种利用医学报告而非手动绘制肿瘤掩膜来训练AI进行肿瘤分割的新方法，显著降低了AI训练成本，在多种肿瘤类型上实现了与使用大量掩膜训练相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI肿瘤分割模型需要大量手动绘制的肿瘤掩膜，成本高昂且耗时。而临床实践中已有丰富的医学报告描述肿瘤特征，这些信息未被充分利用。

Method: R-Super通过训练AI模型使其能够根据医学报告中的肿瘤描述来分割肿瘤，利用101,654份医学报告进行训练，无需大量手动掩膜。

Result: 仅使用报告训练的模型性能与使用723个掩膜训练的模型相当。结合报告和掩膜训练后，敏感度提升13%，特异性提升8%，在7种肿瘤类型中有5种检测性能超过放射科医生。

Conclusion: 该方法挑战了大规模手动肿瘤掩膜创建的必要性，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测提供了可扩展且易于获取的途径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了影响轨迹形成的外部环境和内部路径选择行为。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块和路径选择编码器，前者从POI分布中捕获多粒度环境语义，后者将道路段转换建模为决策序列来捕捉路径选择行为。

Result: 在3个真实世界数据集和5个下游任务上的广泛实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，且在少样本场景下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过统一环境感知和路径选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的性能，具有强大的数据效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决大容量生成模型在智能手机等内存和计算资源受限设备上的部署问题，同时保持模型质量。

Method: 渐进式量化方法，从32位逐步降低到4位精度，在优化过程中利用分数位来维持生成质量。

Result: 在SD3.5-Medium、Sana、PixArt和FLUX.1-schnell等多种扩散模型上实现了改进的质量，比标准QAT的FiD指标降低了4-7%。

Conclusion: SHORT方法成功在三星S25U手机上部署并运行Sana模型，证明了该方法在资源受限设备上的有效性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

Motivation: 解决AI肿瘤分割中缺乏大规模体素级标注数据集的问题，这些数据集难以创建且需要医学专家参与。

Method: 创建了AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描，由23名放射科专家在六个器官（胰腺、肝脏、肾脏、结肠、食管和子宫）中进行体素级肿瘤标注。

Result: 在分布内测试中DSC提升+7%，在分布外测试中DSC提升+16%，显著优于现有公共数据集。

Conclusion: 合成数据可以加速数据缩放规律，AbdomenAtlas 2.0为训练AI分割六个器官中的肿瘤提供了坚实基础，基于JHH数据集的经验教训。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Conclusion: QDepth-VLA通过深度感知表示学习有效增强了VLA模型的空间推理能力，为精细操作任务提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,

*Mihai-Cristian Pîrvu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多模态学习方法，通过预训练专家模型和程序化组合，在无需人工监督的情况下整合多种视觉模态，并开发了一个高效的小型模型PHG-MAE，在实时语义分割等任务上取得了与大型模型竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界本质上是多模态的，但传统机器学习模型多为单模态或双模态。为了真正理解世界，需要整合所有独立模态，特别是在视觉领域。

Method: 使用预训练专家模型和程序化组合，构建完全自主的数据流水线，应用专门设计的PHG-MAE模型来利用多模态数据，并将模型高效蒸馏为小于100万参数的小型模型。

Result: 开发的小型模型（<100万参数）在性能上可与约3亿参数的大型模型竞争，成功部署于手持设备和网络摄像头的实时语义分割任务，并在商品硬件上运行。

Conclusion: 通过多模态整合和高效模型设计，可以在无需大量人工监督的情况下实现高性能的视觉理解任务，为实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了多模态大语言模型在面部识别任务上的表现，发现虽然MLLMs能捕捉丰富的语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中仍落后于专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其在面部识别领域的潜力尚未充分探索，特别是开源MLLMs需要在标准基准测试中与现有面部识别模型进行比较评估。

Method: 在多个面部识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB和RFW）上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统性基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLMs虽然能捕捉面部相关任务的有用语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中表现不如专用模型。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为推进基于MLLM的面部识别奠定了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

*Guangyi Han,Wei Zhai,Yuhang Yang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Free-Form HOI Generation方法，旨在基于细粒度意图生成可控、多样且物理合理的手-物体交互，超越了传统的抓握模式限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI生成研究主要局限于固定抓握模式，控制依赖于物理先验或通用意图指令，这种过度泛化的条件限制了日常HOI的多样性表达。

Method: 构建了WildO2数据集，包含从互联网视频中提取的多样化3D HOI数据；提出了TOUCH框架，基于多级扩散模型，利用显式接触建模进行条件控制，并通过接触一致性和物理约束进行细化。

Result: 实验证明该方法能够生成代表日常活动的可控、多样且物理合理的手部交互。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了HOI从抓握到自由形式交互（如推、戳、旋转）的能力，为手-物体交互生成提供了更细粒度的语义控制。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

TL;DR: BADAS是一个基于真实世界行车记录仪碰撞数据训练的碰撞预测模型家族，专门针对自车威胁进行优化，在多个基准测试中达到最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法区分自车威胁和与自车无关的随机事故，导致实际部署中产生过多误报。

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络进行端到端训练，包含BADAS-Open（基于1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（基于40k专有视频）两个变体，重新标注主要基准数据集以识别自车参与情况。

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并产生更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS通过专门的自车中心评估基准和重新标注策略，显著提升了碰撞预测的准确性和实用性，推动了自车中心碰撞预测研究的发展。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleWeaver是一个基于视觉自回归模型的可控文本到图像生成框架，通过参数高效微调实现高保真度和精确控制，改进了MMDiT块并引入参考注意力模块来有效整合条件信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散模型已经探索了控制机制，但在视觉自回归范式内实现精确灵活的控制仍然研究不足，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 提出ScaleWeaver框架，核心是改进的MMDiT块和参考注意力模块，该模块丢弃了图像到条件的非必要注意力，降低计算成本同时稳定控制注入，并强调参数重用，利用VAR骨干本身的能力处理控制信息。

Result: 大量实验表明，ScaleWeaver能够提供高质量生成和精确控制，同时比基于扩散的方法获得更优的效率。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver是视觉自回归范式中可控文本到图像生成的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出nlg2choice方法解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类中自由形式响应的评估问题，通过两阶段方法提高多选项分类和检索任务的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或5选项以内的多选题，无法处理细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的场景，且在多选项设置下扩展LLM选择提取到检索问题存在计算成本高的挑战

Method: nlg2choice两阶段方法：首先向MLLM提出开放式问题，然后使用纯文本约束解码预测最可能的选择；在检索设置中采用提前停止方法计算约束响应的概率，显著提高吞吐量

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分类和检索评估指标上均有改进，且性能在不同自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类中的评估挑战，特别是在多选项设置下，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

TL;DR: 提出基于多模态大语言模型的视频异常检测框架，通过分析对象活动和交互的文本描述来检测复杂异常，并提供可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法在检测涉及对象交互的复杂异常时表现不佳，且缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用MLLM分析不同时刻对象对的视觉输入，生成活动和交互的文本描述，将这些描述作为高级表示用于异常检测

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效检测基于交互的复杂异常，并在无交互异常的数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了复杂异常检测能力，还提供了内在的可解释性，并能与传统VAD方法结合进一步增强性能

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于密集视频对象字幕任务的复杂性和手动标注的高成本，现有方法采用分离训练策略导致性能不佳，需要开发端到端的解决方案。

Method: 利用最先进的视觉语言模型生成时空定位实体的合成字幕，扩展LVIS和LV-VIS数据集为LVISCap和LV-VISCap，训练MaskCaptioner模型实现联合检测、分割、跟踪和字幕生成。

Result: 在LVISCap和LV-VISCap上预训练后，MaskCaptioner在VidSTG、VLN和BenSMOT三个现有基准测试中实现了最先进的DVOC结果。

Conclusion: 通过合成字幕扩展数据集和端到端训练策略，MaskCaptioner有效解决了密集视频对象字幕任务，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt是一个生成视频的框架，通过双时空条件化实现精确相机控制和场景一致性，使用3D场景记忆来分离静态几何和动态元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于单张图像或短片段生成视频，难以保持长序列的场景一致性和精确相机控制。需要解决在生成超出时间边界时动态元素错误保留的问题。

Method: 采用双时空条件化：时间相邻帧用于运动连续性，空间相邻内容用于场景一致性。引入3D场景记忆表示静态几何，通过动态SLAM和动态掩码策略分离静态场景和移动元素。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法，能够保持长距离空间连贯性而不牺牲计算效率或运动真实感。

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt框架通过结合3D场景记忆和双时空条件化，成功解决了长视频生成中的场景一致性和相机控制问题，为视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Conclusion: RealDPO通过真实世界数据驱动的偏好学习有效提升了视频运动合成的质量，为复杂运动生成提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频恢复4D动态场景的框架，通过引入短期光流和长期点跟踪两种对应关系，将现有3D重建方法扩展到动态场景，实现动态几何和相机姿态的联合估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点图式3D重建方法（如DUSt3R）在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景会导致不准确的结果，因为运动物体违反了多视角几何约束。

Method: C4D框架预测点图的同时捕获两种对应关系：短期光流和长期点跟踪。训练动态感知点跟踪器提供移动性信息，估计运动掩码分离动态元素和静态背景。引入动态场景优化目标来恢复每帧3D几何和相机参数，将2D轨迹提升为平滑的3D轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，C4D实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机姿态估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: C4D通过引入时间对应关系成功将3D重建扩展到4D动态场景，解决了动态物体违反多视角几何约束的问题，实现了集成化的4D重建。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ChangingGrounding基准和Mem-ChangingGrounder方法，用于在动态变化场景中实现基于记忆的3D视觉定位，减少重新扫描需求并提高定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法假设场景点云是重建且最新的，这需要昂贵的重新扫描成本，阻碍了实际部署。需要将3DVG重新定义为主动的、基于记忆的问题。

Method: 提出Mem-ChangingGrounder方法：通过跨模态检索识别查询对象类型，利用相关记忆指导行动，在场景中高效探索目标，当先前操作无效时回退，执行多视角扫描，并将融合证据投影以获得精确边界框。

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准上评估不同基线，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高的定位精度，同时大大降低了探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法推动了面向实际应用的、以记忆为中心的3DVG研究，为现实世界机器人定位物体提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出WithAnyone模型解决身份一致生成中的copy-paste问题，通过构建MultiID-2M数据集、引入对比身份损失，在保持身份相似性的同时实现多样化生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份一致生成模型依赖重建式训练，导致copy-paste问题——直接复制参考人脸而非保持身份在姿势、表情、光照变化中的一致性，限制了生成的可控性和表达能力。

Method: 构建MultiID-2M大规模配对数据集；提出量化copy-paste伪影和身份保真度-变化权衡的基准；引入对比身份损失的训练范式，利用配对数据平衡保真度和多样性。

Result: WithAnyone模型显著减少copy-paste伪影，提高姿势和表情的可控性，保持强感知质量。用户研究验证方法在实现高身份保真度的同时支持表达性可控生成。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效缓解copy-paste问题，在身份一致生成中实现了保真度与多样性的更好平衡，提升了生成模型的可控性和表达能力。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

TL;DR: Terra是一个原生3D世界模型，通过内在的3D潜在空间表示和生成可探索环境，解决了现有方法依赖像素对齐表示而忽视物理世界3D本质的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示作为世界演化的基础，忽略了物理世界固有的3D特性，这会破坏3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点对高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，然后解码为3D高斯基元来联合建模几何和外观；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示，同时去噪点潜在的位置和特征。

Result: 在ScanNet v2的室内场景上进行广泛实验，Terra在重建和生成方面都达到了最先进的性能，具有高度的3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过原生3D表示和架构实现了精确的多视角一致性，支持仅通过单次生成过程从任意视点进行灵活渲染，并通过点潜在空间中的渐进生成实现了可探索的世界建模。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

TL;DR: 提出无需配对数据的图像编辑训练新范式，通过扩散模型展开训练并利用视觉语言模型反馈进行端到端优化，在少步设置下达到与监督训练方法相当的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像编辑模型依赖大规模输入-目标配对数据进行监督微调，但这类自然配对数据难以大规模获取。现有方法使用合成训练对会传播预训练模型的伪影

Method: 直接优化少步扩散模型：训练时展开模型，利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未改变内容，提供直接梯度进行端到端优化；同时加入分布匹配损失确保视觉保真度

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据的情况下，在少步设置下与各种使用大量监督配对数据训练的图像编辑扩散模型性能相当；使用相同VLM作为奖励模型时，优于基于强化学习的技术如Flow-GRPO

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了对配对数据的依赖，提供了一种更高效、更少伪影的图像编辑模型训练范式

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原生视觉语言模型面临的两个关键挑战：与模块化模型的基本限制差异，以及如何使原生VLM研究更加可访问和民主化。

Method: 构建NEO原生VLM家族，基于三个核心原则：(i)在共享语义空间中有效对齐像素和词表示；(ii)无缝整合视觉和语言模块的优势；(iii)内在体现支持统一视觉语言编码、对齐和推理的跨模态属性。

Result: NEO仅使用3.9亿图像-文本样本，就能从零开始高效发展视觉感知，同时在密集单体模型中缓解视觉语言冲突，性能可与顶级模块化模型相媲美。

Conclusion: NEO为可扩展和强大的原生视觉语言模型奠定了基石，提供了丰富的可重用组件，促进了成本效益高且可扩展的生态系统。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

Motivation: 现有2D图像编辑模型在处理多视角图像时无法保持视角间一致性，而基于显式3D表示的方法存在优化过程冗长和稀疏视角下不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用隐式3D正则化方法，通过耦合扩散采样同时从多视角图像分布和2D编辑图像分布中采样，使用耦合项强制多视角一致性。

Result: 在三个不同的多视角图像编辑任务上验证了方法的有效性和通用性，展示了其在不同模型架构间的适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法作为多视角一致编辑的通用解决方案具有潜力，无需冗长的优化过程，在稀疏视角设置下表现稳定。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

Motivation: 物联网设备的快速扩张超过了现有识别方法的能力，在开放世界环境中存在安全、隐私和网络问责风险，需要解决不完整、噪声和被故意混淆的流量元数据问题。

Method: 使用基于互信息和熵的稳定性评分的大语言模型集成生成高质量供应商标签，然后通过课程学习对量化的LLaMA3.18B模型进行指令调优，以支持稀疏性和长尾分布下的泛化。

Conclusion: 指令调优的大语言模型为现实世界设备识别提供了可扩展和可解释的基础，在独立物联网测试平台上的评估验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

Motivation: 传统渐进域适应方法存在知识迁移效率低和中间数据不完整的问题，需要更有效的知识迁移机制。

Result: 在旋转MNIST、颜色偏移MNIST、肖像数据集和Cover Type数据集上的实验表明，STDW优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为鲁棒渐进域适应提供了理论洞见和实用框架，在动态现实场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

Motivation: 假设神经网络在深度特征的高频分量中编码任务相关语义信息，而在低频分量中存储领域特定偏差，通过分离这些分量来提升模型泛化性。

Result: 在视觉、文本、3D和音频等多个领域的实验显示，无论模型架构和数据模态如何，都能获得一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了特征稀疏化并有效隔离高频分量，为核心假设提供了实证验证。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

Motivation: 解决现有联合能量模型(JEM)在同时实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成时面临的训练不稳定和样本质量差的问题

Method: 采用对抗训练原则，用PGD生成的对比样本替代SGLD，结合两阶段训练解决批归一化与EBM的兼容性问题，无需显式梯度惩罚

Conclusion: 对抗训练可作为统一框架的有效基础，同时实现视觉数据的生成和鲁棒分类，解决了JEM扩展的关键稳定性问题

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

Method: 首先构建PeakClips数据集（20万个查询条件视频高光片段），然后采用三阶段渐进式课程学习：两个监督微调阶段用于时间定位和关键片段感知，以及一个强化学习阶段直接优化场景驱动预测策略。

Result: 在主要长视频理解基准测试上的广泛实验表明，K-frames在不同尺度下提供了有效、可解释且即插即用的关键帧选择解决方案。

Conclusion: K-frames通过场景驱动的关键帧选择方法，解决了长视频理解中的关键帧选择问题，在保持时间连续性的同时支持多尺度选择，为下游任务提供了无需额外标注的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be

### [107] [Multi-View Semi-Supervised Label Distribution Learning with Local Structure Complementarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13917)
*Yanshan Xiao,Kaihong Wu,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视图半监督标签分布学习方法MVSS-LDL，通过利用每个视图的局部最近邻结构并强调多视图间局部结构的互补性，解决了多视图半监督标签分布学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标签分布学习方法主要针对单视图和完全标记数据，而多视图标签分布学习问题以及包含未标记数据的情况尚未被考虑。

Method: 首先计算每个视图的k-最近邻结构，然后通过整合其他视图的最近邻信息来补充当前视图的最近邻集合，最后基于补充后的最近邻集合构建基于图学习的多视图半监督标签分布学习模型。

Result: 数值研究表明，MVSS-LDL在分类性能上明显优于现有的单视图标签分布学习方法。

Conclusion: 这是多视图标签分布学习的首次尝试，通过考虑局部最近邻结构的互补性，不同视图可以相互提供局部结构信息来补充彼此。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Weight Weaving方法，通过权重池化技术解决模型融合中缩放超参数λ的数据依赖问题，实现无需评估数据的模型融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法严重依赖缩放超参数λ，通常需要评估数据来调优，这在实践中不可行。需要一种无需数据即可设置缩放因子的原则性方法。

Method: Weight Weaving技术：在λ值搜索空间中对模型权重进行池化，使用用户定义的池化函数（如平均、随机选择或现有融合方法），具有高模块化特性。

Result: 在三个ViT变体和三个实验设置（视觉多任务学习、持续学习、领域泛化）中验证，平均准确率提升高达15.9个百分点，无需评估数据。

Conclusion: Weight Weaving是一种即插即用的正交方法，消除了模型融合对评估数据的需求，显著提升了多种融合方法的性能。

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将ICD编码分配任务视为检索系统问题的新方法，同时考虑分类和排序，显著提升了主要诊断代码的排序准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的ICD编码顺序对医疗诊断和报销至关重要，但现有方法仅将其视为分类任务而忽略了编码顺序的重要性。

Method: 从检索系统角度处理该任务，将其制定为分类和排序任务，同时考虑ICD编码的分类和优先级排序。

Result: 模型在正确排序主要诊断代码方面的准确率达到47%，相比现有最佳分类器的20%有显著提升；在分类指标上，微平均和宏平均F1分数分别为0.6065和0.2904，优于之前最佳模型的0.597和0.2660。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在识别高优先级代码方面具有优越能力，证明了将ICD编码分配视为分类和排序任务的有效性。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

### [110] [Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972)
*George Webber,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据保真度损失函数——分布一致性（DC）损失，用于逆问题中的信号恢复，通过分布级校准替代逐点匹配，避免对测量噪声的过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据保真度损失函数（如MSE）追求与噪声测量的逐点一致性，容易导致对噪声的过拟合。需要一种能够统计上评估测量数据与当前估计所暗示的噪声分布一致性的方法。

Method: 引入分布一致性（DC）损失，使用基于模型的概率分数对每个测量进行分布级校准，替代传统的逐点匹配方法。该方法与现代正则化器兼容，优化方式与传统损失相同。

Result: 在图像去噪中，DC损失消除了早停需求并提高了PSNR；在医学图像重建中，减少了高度迭代重建中的伪影，增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失作为传统保真度损失的统计基础替代方案，在逆问题中表现出性能提升，特别适用于测量噪声分布已知且数据集包含大量独立噪声值的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

*Xun Wu,Shaohan Huang,Wenhui Wang,Ting Song,Li Dong,Yan Xia,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) 是一种轻量级方法，可将全精度LLM微调为1.58位精度（三元权重{-1,0,1}），在特定下游任务上实现接近全精度模型的性能，同时显著减少内存使用和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全精度大语言模型在部署时的高内存消耗和计算成本问题，通过量化技术实现高效的模型压缩，同时保持任务特定性能。

Method: 结合三个关键技术：SubLN模块（来自BitNet）、基于MiniLM的多头注意力蒸馏，以及作为关键预热步骤的持续预训练，以缓解全精度与1.58位模型在特定任务上的性能差距。

Result: 实验结果显示BitDistill在不同模型大小上都能达到与全精度对应模型相当的性能，同时实现高达10倍的内存节省和2.65倍的CPU推理加速。

Conclusion: BitDistill提供了一种有效的模型压缩方案，能够在保持性能的同时显著降低部署成本，为资源受限环境下的LLM应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

*Mike Lasby,Ivan Lazarevich,Nish Sinnadurai,Sean Lie,Yani Ioannou,Vithursan Thangarasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为REAP的专家剪枝方法，证明在生成任务中专家剪枝优于专家合并，通过考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数，在50%压缩率下实现接近无损的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏激活的专家混合模型虽然预训练效率高且延迟低，但参数量大导致内存开销显著，需要研究专家压缩方法。

Method: 提出Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP)方法，结合路由器门值和专家激活范数作为剪枝标准，避免专家合并导致的功能子空间坍塌问题。

Result: 在20B到1T参数的SMoE模型上，REAP在生成基准测试中始终优于合并和其他剪枝方法，特别是在50%压缩率下。在代码生成和工具调用任务中，即使剪枝50%专家也能实现接近无损的压缩。

Conclusion: 专家剪枝是生成任务的更优压缩策略，REAP方法通过避免功能子空间坍塌，实现了高效的模型压缩。

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了条件Clifford-可导向核，通过增强输入相关的核函数来改进CSCNNs的表达能力，在多个PDE预测任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Clifford-可导向CNNs（CSCNNs）的核基不完整，限制了模型表达能力，需要解决这一问题以提升性能。

Method: 提出条件Clifford-可导向核，通过从输入特征场计算等变表示来增强核函数，并推导了等变约束条件，通过隐式参数化高效求解。

Result: 在流体动力学和相对论电动力学等PDE预测任务中，该方法始终优于基线方法，证明了改进的表达能力。

Conclusion: 条件Clifford-可导向核有效解决了CSCNNs核基不完整的问题，显著提升了模型在物理系统预测任务中的性能。

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

*Jie Hao,Xiaochuan Gong,Jie Xu,Zhengdao Wang,Mingrui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在几何感知优化算法基础上添加噪声自适应分层学习率的方法，通过估计梯度方差来动态调整层间学习率，显著加速了深度神经网络训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的几何感知优化算法（如Muon）虽然通过为不同层选择适当范数来利用DNN的底层几何结构，但在同一范数组内的层之间仍使用固定学习率。然而，即使在同一组内，各层的局部曲率也存在异质性且随训练动态变化，这可能导致训练效率低下。

Method: 在几何感知优化算法之上引入噪声自适应分层学习率方案，通过实时估计由所选LMO诱导的对偶范数中的梯度方差，为每个组内的层分配随时间变化的噪声自适应分层学习率。

Result: 理论分析表明该算法实现了锐利的收敛率。在LLaMA和GPT等transformer架构上的实证结果显示，该方法比最先进的优化器收敛更快。

Conclusion: 提出的噪声自适应分层学习率方案能够有效加速DNN训练，特别是在transformer架构上表现出优于现有方法的收敛性能。

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COFFEE模型是一种新颖的时变状态空间模型，通过引入状态反馈机制实现上下文相关的选择性，解决了Transformer的二次复杂度和长序列依赖问题，在参数效率和性能上显著优于S6模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型存在二次复杂度和处理长序列依赖的困难，而现有的状态空间模型（如S6）的选择性机制仅依赖于当前输入，缺乏对序列历史的上下文理解。

Method: COFFEE模型通过状态反馈机制，从内部状态计算选择性，内部状态作为序列历史的紧凑表示；采用高效模型参数化，消除S6中的冗余，实现更紧凑和可训练的公式。

Result: 在induction head任务中，COFFEE以两个数量级更少的参数和训练序列实现接近完美的准确率；在MNIST上，仅用3585个参数就达到97%准确率，大幅优于S6。

Conclusion: 状态反馈是构建可扩展和高效序列模型的关键机制，COFFEE展示了通过状态反馈实现上下文依赖选择性的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

Motivation: 现有因果表示学习评估存在现实性与评估精度之间的困境，要么使用过于简化的合成数据集，要么依赖真实世界任务的下游性能，缺乏既真实又具有真实因果生成过程的数据集。

Method: 创建包含24个子场景的模拟视觉数据集，提供底层因果结构的灵活访问，允许用户修改或配置因果结构以符合CRL假设，如可用域标签、时间依赖性或干预历史。

Conclusion: 该基准在严格评估和现实适用性之间架起了桥梁，为因果表示学习提供了一个全面的测试平台。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，这类网络捕捉了卷积神经网络或图神经网络的关键特性，旨在理解其计算能力和结构限制。

Method: 建立了稀疏maxout网络与虚拟多面体类之间的对偶关系，利用多面体几何分析网络表达能力，推导了相关多面体的维度紧界，并构建了深度层次结构。

Result: 证明了足够深的稀疏maxout网络具有通用性，但在固定入度约束下，如果深度不足，仅增加宽度无法弥补稀疏性带来的限制。

Conclusion: 稀疏maxout网络的表达能力与深度密切相关，在固定稀疏性约束下，深度是实现通用逼近能力的关键因素，宽度无法替代深度的作用。

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

Conclusion: Neural Effect Search能够直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，为大规模因果推断提供了新途径。

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Transformer网络在超出训练分布的系统性组合泛化能力，提出了四种架构机制来增强OOD泛化，并通过机制可解释性分析揭示了这些机制如何实现鲁棒的算法泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统性组合泛化超越训练分布仍然是机器学习的核心挑战，也是现代语言模型推理能力的关键瓶颈。

Method: 使用GSM8K风格的模块化算术计算图任务作为测试平台，引入四种架构机制：输入自适应循环、算法监督、通过离散瓶颈的锚定潜在表示、显式纠错机制。

Result: 这些机制共同形成了一种在Transformer网络中实现原生可扩展潜在空间推理的架构方法，具有鲁棒的算法泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过详细的机制可解释性分析，揭示了这些机制如何产生鲁棒的OOD泛化能力，为Transformer网络的推理能力提供了新的架构设计思路。

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

TL;DR: 提出TENDE方法，利用基于分数的扩散模型通过条件互信息估计传递熵，解决了现有方法维度灾难、分布假设限制和数据需求大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有传递熵估计方法存在维度灾难、需要限制性分布假设或需要指数级大数据集才能可靠收敛的问题。

Method: TENDE方法利用基于分数的扩散模型学习相关条件分布的概率密度函数，通过条件互信息来估计传递熵。

Result: 在合成基准测试和真实数据上，TENDE相比现有神经估计器和其他最先进方法展现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TENDE提供了一种灵活、可扩展的传递熵估计方法，对底层数据生成过程做出最小假设。

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究双边市场中的定价和匹配算法，提出了一种基于在线学习的新颖定价策略，在平台利润最大化和队列长度控制之间实现了近乎最优的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在双边市场中，平台需要同时考虑价格敏感的客户和服务提供商的动态到达，设计能够最大化利润同时控制队列长度的定价和匹配策略。由于实际中需求和供给曲线可能未知，需要开发不依赖这些信息的在线学习算法。

Method: 提出了一种结合动态优化和概率组件的在线学习定价策略。动态组件优化了低遗憾值和小队列长度之间的权衡，概率组件解决了获取有用样本进行快速学习与维持小队列长度之间的张力。

Result: 证明了在γ∈(0,1/6]范围内，实现了Õ(T^{1-γ})遗憾值、Õ(T^{γ/2})平均队列长度和Õ(T^{γ})最大队列长度的性能权衡，显著优于现有结果。除了γ的允许范围外，这种遗憾值与平均队列长度的权衡在策略类下是最优的。

Conclusion: 所提出的策略在未知需求和供给曲线的情况下，实现了近乎最优的性能，为双边市场的动态定价和匹配问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

For the first time, scaling this efficiency gain to the global fleet of gas
power plants, we estimate an annual 26 Mt reduction potential in CO$_2$ (with
10.6 Mt in Asia, 9.0 Mt in the Americas, and 4.5 Mt in Europe). These results
underscore the synergetic role of machine learning in delivering near-term,

Motivation: 理解无监督强化学习中涌现探索的机制，特别是SGCRL算法如何在没有外部奖励的情况下实现有效探索。

Method: 结合理论分析和控制实验，研究SGCRL的目标函数和表示学习机制，分析其如何通过隐式奖励塑造探索行为。

Result: SGCRL通过学习状态空间的低秩表示来最大化隐式奖励，这些表示自动调整奖励景观以促进探索（到达目标前）和利用（到达目标后）。

Conclusion: 对SGCRL探索机制的理解使其能够适应安全感知探索，展示了表示学习在驱动无监督强化学习探索中的关键作用。

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-GCN架构，通过解耦节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应，解决异构多跳无线网络中p-persistent CSMA协议吞吐量预测问题，显著优于传统GNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统简化模型在稀疏拓扑中低估吞吐量48-62%，精确马尔可夫链分析计算复杂度呈指数增长，标准GNN因对称归一化混淆直接干扰与高阶级联效应而表现不佳。

Method: 提出解耦图卷积网络(D-GCN)，用可学习注意力替代均值聚合，显式分离节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应处理，捕捉复杂多跳干扰模式。

Result: D-GCN达到3.3%归一化平均绝对误差，优于强基线方法，在精确分析方法计算不可行时仍保持可处理性，基于梯度的网络优化达到理论最优值的1%以内。

Conclusion: D-GCN通过解耦架构有效解决无线网络吞吐量预测问题，为大规模网络提供可扩展的机器学习解决方案，同时支持网络优化应用。

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

Conclusion: ProtGram-DirectGCN框架为蛋白质相互作用预测提供了一种计算效率高且性能优异的方法，特别适合处理复杂定向图结构。

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Conclusion: 将融合重新定义为生成重构能力强的模型空间而非单一合并模型，可逆方法能更好地平衡多任务性能

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

TL;DR: 对分子核进行首次全面谱分析，发现更丰富的谱特征并不总能提高预测精度，甚至在某些情况下与性能呈负相关。仅保留前2%特征值即可恢复大部分性能，挑战了"更丰富谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度模型在分子性质预测中达到最先进精度，但核方法因其在低数据环境下的鲁棒性和透明理论基础仍被广泛使用。尽管机器学习中已有大量核谱研究，但对分子核的系统谱分析却很缺乏。

Method: 在QM9数据集上对分子指纹、预训练transformer、全局和局部3D表示等七种分子性质进行核岭回归的全面谱分析，使用四种不同谱度量指标，并实现截断核来探究谱与预测性能的关系。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，更丰富的谱特征并不一致提高精度。对于transformer和局部3D表示，谱丰富度甚至与性能呈负相关。在许多核中，仅保留前2%特征值即可恢复几乎所有性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了"更丰富谱产生更好泛化"的常见启发式观点，揭示了表示、核特征和预测性能之间的微妙关系。这些发现为在数据有限的科学和实际任务中如何评估核和自监督学习方法提供了信息。

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文揭示了平坦最小值与对抗鲁棒性的复杂关系：平坦性仅能保证局部鲁棒性，而非全局鲁棒性。为实现全局鲁棒性，损失函数需要在数据流形外急剧弯曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络经验上成功，但仍易受微小对抗扰动影响。长期以来假设平坦最小值能提供更强鲁棒性，但这种联系缺乏严格形式化分析。

Method: 首先推导倒数第二层相对平坦度的闭式表达式，利用此约束损失在输入空间的变化，从而形式化分析整个网络的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 理论预测在不同架构和数据集上得到验证，揭示了对抗脆弱性的几何结构，并发现对抗样本常位于模型自信错误的平坦区域。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了对平坦性的简化理解，提供了关于其在鲁棒性中作用的细致认识：平坦性仅保证局部鲁棒性，全局鲁棒性需要损失函数在数据流形外急剧弯曲。

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 理论保证策略优化在鲁棒RL中可实现多项式次优界和样本效率，与基于价值的方法性能相当

Conclusion: DR-RPO在多样化领域中验证了其鲁棒性，为鲁棒RL中的策略优化提供了理论和实证支持

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在预测弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应时，对未见海况的泛化能力有限，主要原因是忽视了海洋系统的自然衰减现象和波-结构相互作用的充分建模。

Result: 在波浪水槽数据集上的实验表明，PhysAttnNet显著优于主流模型，跨场景泛化测试验证了模型对未见环境的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: PhysAttnNet作为海洋工程中复杂系统预测模型的开发框架具有重要潜力，能够有效提升弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型在时间序列分析中的应用日益增多，特别是生理信号处理领域，需要比较通用型模型（如MOMENT）与专用型模型在PPG信号分析中的性能差异。

Method: 通过51个任务（包括心脏状态评估、实验室值估计和跨模态推理）对两种模型进行七维度评估：胜率得分、平均性能、特征质量、调优增益、性能方差、可迁移性和可扩展性。

Result: 在完全微调场景下，专用模型比通用模型获得27%更高的胜率得分，在多个评估维度上表现更优。

Conclusion: 专用模型在PPG信号分析任务中表现更佳，研究还提供了关于泛化性、公平性、注意力可视化和训练数据选择重要性的深入分析。

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然取得了显著成功，但其内部机制仍然不透明，需要新的可解释性方法来理解其工作原理。

Method: 使用Moore-Penrose伪逆估计每层的实现变换矩阵，并通过六个可解释的度量指标进行频谱分析。

Result: 分析揭示了编码器模型和解码器模型的不同行为：解码器模型表现出压缩-扩展循环，而编码器模型保持一致的高秩处理。核分析显示层间功能关系模式，CKA相似性矩阵将层划分为三个阶段：特征提取、压缩和专业化。

Conclusion: CAST提供了一种无探针的分析框架，能够从频谱角度深入理解Transformer模型各层的功能特性，为模型可解释性研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型归因方法需要模型梯度或重新训练，限制了在专有或大规模环境中的适用性，需要一种完全基于数据的非参数方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算高效、空间可解释的归因框架，能够揭示训练数据与输出之间的内在关系，且独立于具体模型。

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

Motivation: 现有早期事件预测系统忽略风险分数的稳定性评估，且主要基于表格数据，缺乏对多模态输入下轨迹行为的测试。

Method: 提出CAREBench基准，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），并引入基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。

Result: 现有方法（特别是LLMs）难以同时优化准确性和稳定性，在高精度操作点召回率表现较差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够产生证据对齐的稳定轨迹的模型，以在连续监测环境中赢得临床医生的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的边缘设备上，单独使用储层计算需要过大的储层才能达到足够的异常检测性能，而注意力机制虽然能提高精度但计算量大，会损害RC的学习效率

Method: 将谱残差方法（一种无学习的自底向上注意力机制）与储层计算集成，形成谱残差RC方法

Result: SR-RC在基准任务和真实世界时间序列数据集上优于传统RC和基于SR方法提取值的逻辑回归模型

Conclusion: 由于SR方法与RC都适合硬件实现，SR-RC为在边缘AI中部署RC进行时间序列异常检测提供了实用方向

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

TL;DR: TED++是一个子流形感知框架，通过构建类特征流形的管状邻域和局部自适应排序来检测逃避现有防御的隐蔽后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在关键应用中广泛使用，隐蔽的后门攻击（中毒训练输入触发恶意行为但看起来正常）构成严重安全风险。现有防御在面对利用微妙距离异常或干净样本稀缺的攻击时存在漏洞。

Method: TED++为每个类的隐藏特征流形构建管状邻域，从少量干净激活中估计局部"厚度"，然后应用局部自适应排序检测超出允许管的激活。通过聚合所有层的LAR调整排名，捕获输入在演化类子流形上的忠实度。

Result: 在基准数据集和任务上的广泛实验表明，TED++在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下实现了最先进的检测性能。即使每类只有5个保留样本，TED++仍能实现近乎完美的检测，AUROC比次优方法提升高达14%。

Conclusion: TED++通过特征流形的管约束行为有效检测隐蔽后门攻击，在数据稀缺和自适应攻击场景下表现出色，为深度神经网络安全提供了有力保障。

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 尽管测量成本存在，但减少的不确定性可以证明提高样本效率并增加最优策略的价值。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

Method: 提出LLM-ERM框架：使用预训练LLM生成k个候选程序，在验证数据上编译检查并选择最佳假设，无需反馈、自适应或梯度计算。

Result: 在奇偶校验变体、模式匹配和素数测试等任务上，仅需200个样本即可解决，而SGD训练的transformer即使使用100,000个样本也会过拟合。

Conclusion: 语言引导的程序合成恢复了有限类ERM的统计效率，同时保持计算可行性，为学习梯度训练无法达到的简洁假设提供了实用途径。

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

### [149] [DARTS-GT: Differentiable Architecture Search for Graph Transformers with Quantifiable Instance-Specific Interpretability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14336)
*Shruti Sarika Chakraborty,Peter Minary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出DARTS-GT，通过非对称注意力机制和解耦结构编码与特征表示，在Transformer注意力内部使用可微分架构搜索选择最优GNN算子，并开发首个图Transformer定量可解释性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图Transformer存在设计僵化、缺乏量化可解释性的问题，固定GNN类型无法充分利用深度特异性组件选择，复杂架构难以区分性能提升是来自有意义的模式还是伪相关。

Method: 重新设计图Transformer注意力机制，将结构编码与特征表示解耦：查询来自节点特征，键值来自GNN变换。在框架内使用DARTS为每层选择最优GNN算子，实现注意力内部的深度异质性。开发基于因果消融的定量可解释性框架。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，DARTS-GT在4个数据集上达到最先进性能，其他数据集保持竞争力。发现的架构揭示了数据集特定模式。可解释性分析显示视觉注意力显著性与因果重要性并不总是相关。

Conclusion: DARTS-GT发现的异质架构始终产生比基线更可解释的模型，表明图Transformer无需在性能和可解释性之间做出选择。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

*Jaewan Park,Solbee Cho,Jay-Yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Stop-RAG，一种基于价值控制的迭代RAG停止策略，通过马尔可夫决策过程自适应决定何时停止检索，在保持与现有系统兼容的同时提升多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代RAG在回答复杂多跳问题时，每次额外循环都会增加延迟、成本和引入干扰证据的风险，需要高效的停止策略。现有方法要么使用预定迭代次数，要么依赖不能很好反映是否需要更多检索的置信度代理。

Method: 将迭代RAG建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，引入基于价值的控制器Stop-RAG，使用完整轨迹的全宽度前向视图Q(λ)目标进行训练，学习有效的停止策略。

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，Stop-RAG持续优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的LLM停止方法。

Conclusion: 自适应停止是当前代理系统中的关键缺失组件，基于价值的控制可以提升RAG系统的准确性。

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为自动微分理论提供几何基础，通过微分几何视角理解AD，为深度学习和科学计算开发结构保持的微分方法奠定理论基础。

Method: 使用jet bundles和Weil代数的几何框架，将反向模式AD建模为余切拉回操作，泰勒模式作为Weil代数中的求值过程。

Result: 推导出反向模式的函子恒等式、高阶导数的代数精确性、截断误差的显式界，并证明张量化Weil代数能以线性成本一次性计算所有混合导数。

Conclusion: 该框架为AD理论提供了微分几何视角，为开发结构保持的微分方法奠定了基础，避免了嵌套JVP/VJP调度的组合爆炸问题。

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析了LLM提示优化中的投毒风险，发现基于反馈的攻击比注入查询攻击更危险，提出了无需访问奖励模型的假奖励攻击方法，并开发了高亮防御机制来降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM系统现在支撑着日常AI应用，其性能通常依赖于精心设计的提示。虽然LLM提示优化器通过迭代优化提示来减少人工努力，但这个优化阶段的安全性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用HarmBench进行系统分析，引入简单的假奖励攻击方法（无需访问奖励模型），并提出轻量级的高亮防御机制。

Result: 发现系统对操纵反馈的脆弱性显著高于注入查询：基于反馈的攻击将攻击成功率提高了ΔASR=0.48。假奖励攻击将ΔASR从0.23提升到0.07，同时不降低实用性。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明提示优化管道是一个重要的攻击面，需要为反馈通道和优化框架建立更强的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合脉冲神经网络（SNNs）的能效优势和状态空间模型（SSMs）在长序列建模中的能力，开发适用于资源受限应用的乘法自由、稀疏事件驱动的深度学习模型。

Method: 设计第二阶脉冲SSM，利用并行扫描实现动态系统的稳定高效实现，并首次提出基于核的脉冲回归器用于超长序列。

Result: 在18k序列上比第二阶ANN-based SSMs能耗降低73倍，在50k序列上仍保持优越性能，平均表现优于transformer或第一阶SSMs。

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM在超长序列建模中实现了性能与能效的平衡，为资源受限应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态学习中不仅存在表示层的不平衡，决策层也存在显著偏差，并提出需要在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制来解决模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习经常遭受模态不平衡问题，主导模态在联合优化过程中会压制较弱模态，这种不平衡不仅发生在表示学习阶段，在决策层也显著存在。

Method: 通过在音频-视觉数据集（CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds）上进行实验分析，发现即使经过大量预训练和平衡优化，模型仍对某些模态（如音频）存在系统性偏差，并分析这种偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异。

Result: 实验表明，融合阶段未校准的模态输出聚合会导致决策层权重偏差，阻碍较弱模态有效贡献。模型表现出对音频等特定模态的系统性偏好。

Conclusion: 未来的多模态系统应更多关注在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制，根据各模态的能力实现相对平衡的决策权重分配。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了交互一致性指数（IC-index）来评估药物-靶点亲和力预测中交互方向的准确性，弥补了现有预测性能评估指标的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物-靶点亲和力（DTA）预测方法主要关注亲和力值的准确性，但忽略了交互方向的重要性。正确捕捉交互作用能显著提升药物分配决策的质量。

Method: 引入IC-index评估指标，分析预测器在交互方向预测上的性能。通过理论证明和实证评估，考察不同机器学习算法在多个生物医学数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验表明IC-index能有效补充现有预测性能评估指标，揭示不同亲和力强度预测方法在交互方向捕捉能力上的差异。

Conclusion: IC-index为DTA预测提供了重要的交互方向评估维度，有助于提升药物靶点分配决策的准确性，特别是在处理未见过的药物或靶点时。

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

Motivation: MoE技术在扩大模型规模方面很有前景，但其巨大的内存开销使得压缩成为重要研究方向。

Method: 从专家输出合并的角度重新解释专家合并，将其视为在正向计算中插入额外矩阵，并基于此提出数学优化方法MergeMoE。

Result: 在多个MoE模型上的评估显示，MergeMoE在相同压缩比下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 从专家输出合并角度分析MoE压缩，提出的MergeMoE方法在压缩效果上表现优异。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索神经网络剪枝后性能恢复的最佳方法，特别是针对大型语言模型，传统方法避免完全重训练，但作者质疑这种做法的必要性。

Method: 在GPT架构上进行广泛计算研究，比较不同重建粒度（单矩阵、组件级、块级）和重训练方法的效果，使用简单高效的剪枝标准如Wanda。

Result: 发现组件级重建（分别重建注意力机制和MLP）是帕累托最优方案，比完全重训练性能更好且内存需求更少；简单剪枝标准配合适当重建可超越复杂方法。

Conclusion: 挑战了"不惜一切代价避免重训练"的传统观点，证明适当的重建方法比完全重训练更有效，为LLM剪枝后性能恢复提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Motivation: 传统生成建模方法难以正确再现河流沉积物等地质结构的连续性特征，需要更有效的方法来预测地下物理属性分布并量化不确定性。

Method: 使用过程基础模型生成训练数据，然后训练GAN生成3D河流沉积物图像，并通过消融研究验证深度学习技术在3D图像生成中的可迁移性。

Result: GAN能够稳定训练，生成的样本能再现沉积物的非平稳性和细节特征，没有出现模式崩溃或纯记忆训练数据的问题，并能通过沉积时间验证叠加定律。

Conclusion: GAN在特定地质结构数据集上表现出比预期更强的鲁棒性，利用地质原理如叠加定律来指导深度生成模型具有很大潜力，但在更大3D图像和多模态数据集上的适用性仍需验证。

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

Method: 使用In-Context Approximation(ICA)估计候选样本在训练后的损失，基于局部线性化等价于向保持集最优解的一阶更新，并从中推导每样本权重动态重加权梯度更新。

Result: 在SFT、DPO和SimPO等多种设置下，ICA重加权方法持续改善模型对齐效果，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ICA框架为数据选择和重加权提供了理论基础和实用方法，但在快速漂移的在线策略更新方面存在局限，需要未来研究。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

TL;DR: 提出可逆学习框架，通过状态可逆性度量和选择性回滚机制，提高基于价值的强化学习在部分不可逆环境中的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于价值的强化学习智能体在部分不可逆环境中容易产生价值高估和不稳定的问题，提高决策安全性和可靠性。

Method: 使用经验推导的状态-动作可逆性度量Phi(s,a)来量化在固定时间窗口内返回先前状态的可能性，并动态调整TD更新中的惩罚项；同时引入选择性状态回滚操作，当动作收益显著低于预期值时回滚到前一个状态。

Result: 在CliffWalking v0环境中减少了99.8%的灾难性跌落，平均回合回报提高55%；在Taxi v3环境中抑制了≥99.9%的非法动作，累积奖励提高65.7%，同时显著降低了两个环境中的奖励方差。

Conclusion: 回滚机制是实现安全和性能提升的关键组件，为安全可靠的顺序决策提供了稳健的方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

Conclusion: 选择性表示空间通过自适应选择最具信息量的片段，有效提升了时间序列预测的性能，为基于分块的模型提供了新的增强方法。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于先验预测矩匹配的严格方法来确定概率张量模型中的秩可识别性，将矩匹配条件转化为对数线性方程组，并证明了秩可识别性与该方程组可解性的等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量分解中潜在维度（秩）的选择通常依赖启发式方法，缺乏严格的数学基础，因此需要一种严谨的方法来确定秩的可识别性。

Method: 通过将矩匹配条件转化为关于边际矩、先验超参数和秩的对数线性方程组，建立秩可识别性与方程组可解性的等价关系，并应用于四种基础张量模型。

Result: 证明PARAFAC/CP、张量链和张量环模型的秩是可识别的，而Tucker模型的秩由于对称拓扑导致系统欠定而不可识别。对于可识别模型，推导了基于观测数据矩的显式闭式秩估计器。

Conclusion: 该方法为张量分解中的秩选择提供了严格的数学框架，通过矩匹配方法实现了秩的可识别性分析，并开发了有效的秩估计器。

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

TL;DR: 提出了Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO)算法，通过平衡熵信号来解决代理强化学习中训练崩溃问题，在14个数据集上优于7种主流RL算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流代理强化学习算法过度依赖熵信号进行不确定性探索，这会导致训练崩溃问题，需要平衡熵在训练过程中的作用。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1) 动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监测自适应分配采样预算，并对连续高熵步骤施加分支惩罚；(2) 熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并采用熵感知优势估计。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO持续优于7种主流RL算法。仅用1K RL样本，Qwen3-14B模型在GAIA上达到47.6% Pass@1和65.0% Pass@5，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到11.2% Pass@1和26.0% Pass@5，在WebWalker上达到43.0% Pass@1和70.0% Pass@5。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性，同时保持稳定的策略熵，有助于可扩展的web代理训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MX+格式，一种基于块浮点数(BFP)的扩展方法，通过重新利用异常值的指数字段作为扩展尾数来提高精度，在4位精度下显著提升大语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低精度格式要么需要侵入式软件修改，要么不够通用。超低位BFP格式由于块内异常值问题导致语言模型性能不佳，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 基于微缩放(MX)格式提出MX+扩展，关键思路是异常值不需要使用其指数字段，可以重新利用该字段作为扩展尾数来提高异常值元素的精度。

Result: MX+在4位精度下相比MXFP4显著提升了模型性能，存储开销和速度损失可忽略不计，成为MXFP4或MXFP6的有力替代方案。

Conclusion: MX+提供了一种成本效益高且非侵入式的解决方案，能够有效处理BFP格式中的异常值问题，为大语言模型的高效推理提供了有吸引力的选择。

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: RedOUT是一个无监督图OOD检测框架，通过结构熵和冗余感知图信息瓶颈来减少结构冗余，提升图分类中的分布外检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据和测试数据之间的分布差异会导致模型在遇到分布外样本时做出不准确预测。现有图OOD检测方法虽然使用数据技术提取有效表示，但其性能仍受结构冗余导致的语义偏移影响。

Method: 提出RedOUT框架，集成结构熵到测试时图OOD检测中。引入冗余感知图信息瓶颈(ReGIB)，将目标分解为基本信息和无关冗余。通过最小化结构熵减少解耦的冗余，并提出理论上的上下界进行优化。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验显示RedOUT在OOD检测上表现优异，平均提升6.7%，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集对上显著超越最佳竞争对手17.3%。

Conclusion: RedOUT通过结构熵和冗余感知图信息瓶颈有效解决了图OOD检测中的结构冗余问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Motivation: Transformer在表格数据基础模型中表现出色，但其二次复杂度限制了效率。状态空间模型（SSM）具有线性复杂度，但对输入顺序敏感，这在表格数据中是不期望的特性。

Method: 采用Hydra双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型作为Transformer的替代方案，通过双向上下文聚合来减少对输入顺序的依赖。

Result: 该方法显著降低了对输入顺序的依赖性，预测性能与原TabPFN模型相当。

Conclusion: Hydra SSM作为Transformer的替代方案，在保持效率的同时实现了竞争性的预测性能，为表格数据基础模型提供了更高效的架构选择。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Conformal Labeling的新方法，通过控制错误发现率(FDR)来识别AI预测可被证明可信的实例，确保AI分配标签的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型在标签预测中不可避免的错误问题，现有选择性标注方法缺乏对AI标注质量的保证，导致AI标注子集错误率过高。

Method: 为每个测试实例构建符合性p值，通过比较AI模型的预测置信度与校准实例中被AI错误标注的置信度，选择p值低于数据依赖阈值的实例。

Result: 实验证明该方法在各种任务（图像和文本标注、LLM问答）中实现了严格的FDR控制和高功效。

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling方法提供了理论保证，能够控制FDR在名义水平以下，确保预定比例的AI分配标签平均上是正确的。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and

Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling

Motivation: 现有Transformer设计在张量并行训练中存在显著的通信开销，特别是每块的MHA-MLP连接需要all-reduce通信。研究发现MHA-MLP连接可以绕过以提高效率。

Method: 提出FAL架构，将第一层MHA输出重定向到后续层MLP输入，消除每块的MHA-MLP连接。FAL+进一步将归一化的第一注意力输出添加到后续层MHA输出中，以增强MLP输入质量。

Result: FAL将多GPU训练时间减少高达44%，单GPU吞吐量提高1.18倍，困惑度优于基线GPT。FAL+在不增加训练时间的情况下实现更低的困惑度。

Conclusion: FAL和FAL+通过重新设计Transformer连接结构，有效减少了通信开销，提高了训练效率和模型质量。

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 星系形态研究对理解星系演化至关重要，但大规模数据的形态确定工作繁重。现有机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，无法提供决策过程的洞察。

Method: 在经典编码器-解码器架构基础上扩展可逆流，实现预测和反事实解释功能。

Conclusion: 所提出的可逆流扩展架构为星系形态分类提供了兼具高性能和可解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: Galaxy morphologies play an essential role in the study of the evolution of
galaxies. The determination of morphologies is laborious for a large amount of
data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of
these approaches offer no insight into how the model works and make the results
difficult to understand and explain. We here propose to extend a classical
encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow, allowing us to not only
obtain a good predictive performance but also provide additional information
about the decision process with counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经形态无线传感器网络的低功耗在线异常检测框架，使用事件驱动的神经形态传感器和脉冲无线电传输，通过在线假设检验和多臂老虎机优化传感器查询策略，在严格控制误报率的同时实现高效检测。


<details>

Motivation: 针对脑机接口和远程环境监测等应用场景，需要低功耗、高可靠性的异常检测系统，传统方法难以在严格误报率控制下实现高效检测和通信调度。

Method: 使用事件驱动的神经形态传感器产生脉冲信号，中央读取器通过脉冲无线电接收数据，采用基于e值的在线假设检验控制误报率，并将传感器查询建模为多臂老虎机问题动态优化查询策略。

Result: 该方法在严格误报率要求下能可靠检测异常，同时高效调度传感器通信并实现低检测延迟。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为低功耗无线传感器网络中的在线异常检测提供了有效解决方案，在保证检测可靠性的同时优化了资源利用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出FedPPA方法，通过渐进式参数对齐解决联邦学习中模型和数据异质性问题，在非IID设置下提升个性化鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实联邦学习场景中客户端存在计算资源异质性和非IID数据分布，现有个性化联邦学习方法通常忽略模型和数据异质性的共存问题

Method: 渐进式参数对齐(FedPPA)，逐步对齐客户端通用层权重与全局模型权重，并集成基于熵的加权平均

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FedPPA持续优于现有联邦学习算法，在个性化适应方面取得优越性能

Conclusion: FedPPA有效缓解客户端更新期间全局与局部模型的不一致性，同时保留客户端本地知识，增强了非IID设置下的个性化鲁棒性

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

*Alexandru Meterez,Depen Morwani,Jingfeng Wu,Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Seesaw框架，通过在学习率衰减时同时增加批处理大小来加速大语言模型预训练，在保持损失动态的同时减少串行步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批处理大小增加（批处理斜坡）是加速大语言模型预训练的有前景策略，但对于Adam等自适应优化器的最优策略尚不明确，通常需要启发式调优。

Method: 开发了Seesaw框架：当标准调度器将学习率减半时，Seesaw将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批处理大小，保持损失动态同时减少串行步骤。

Result: 在150M/300M/600M参数模型上，Seesaw在相同FLOPs下与余弦衰减匹配，同时将挂钟时间减少约36%，接近理论极限。

Conclusion: Seesaw为批处理大小调度提供了原则性框架，在保持训练质量的同时显著加速大语言模型预训练。

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

### [180] [Tawa: Automatic Warp Specialization for Modern GPUs with Asynchronous References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14719)
*Hongzheng Chen,Bin Fan,Alexander Collins,Bastian Hagedorn,Evghenii Gaburov,Masahiro Masuda,Matthew Brookhart,Chris Sullivan,Jason Knight,Zhiru Zhang,Vinod Grover*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tawa是一个自动编译器，能从高级瓦片化程序生成高性能的warp专业化代码，通过异步引用抽象简化GPU数据流编程，在LLM内核上实现优于cuBLAS和Triton的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU的异步数据流执行硬件与传统SIMT编程模型不匹配，导致程序开发困难且性能无法充分发挥。硬件级warp专业化虽然能提升性能，但需要开发者手动管理复杂的低级通信和软件管道，过程繁琐易错。

Method: 提出Tawa编译器，使用新颖的异步引用IR抽象来表达warp级通信，无需暴露底层硬件细节。自动将程序划分为生产者-消费者角色，管理复杂的数据流管道，避免侵入式内核重写。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上评估显示：对于LLM内核，Tawa实现高硬件利用率，比高度优化的cuBLAS GEMM内核快1.1倍；对于注意力工作负载，比Triton快1.2倍，且性能与手工优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3内核相当，但编程工作量大幅减少。

Conclusion: Tawa通过自动化warp专业化代码生成，成功弥合了GPU数据流硬件与编程模型之间的差距，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了开发复杂度。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: INDAGO-Nexus是一种多目标搜索方法，用于发现深度强化学习代理的多样化故障场景，相比单目标优化的INDAGO工具，能发现更多独特故障并减少故障发现时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具如INDAGO仅关注最大化故障数量，无法确保发现的故障场景具有多样性或揭示不同的错误类型。

Method: 使用多目标进化算法，联合优化故障可能性和测试场景多样性，采用多种多样性指标和帕累托前沿选择策略。

Result: 在三个DRL代理上评估：人形步行者、自动驾驶汽车和停车代理。平均而言，INDAGO-Nexus在SDC和停车场景中分别比INDAGO多发现83%和40%的独特故障，同时所有代理的故障发现时间减少高达67%。

Conclusion: INDAGO-Nexus通过多目标优化方法显著提高了测试效果，能够发现更多样化的故障场景并加速故障发现过程。

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

TL;DR: 该论文提出未来摘要预测(FSP)方法，通过预测序列的长期未来摘要来改进语言模型的长期推理能力，相比传统的下一个词预测(NTP)和多词预测(MTP)在数学、推理和编程任务上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的下一个词预测(NTP)在长期推理、规划和创意写作方面存在局限，多词预测(MTP)只能捕捉短期依赖关系，改进有限。需要一种能够处理长期依赖关系的新方法。

Method: 提出未来摘要预测(FSP)，训练一个辅助头来预测长期未来的紧凑表示。探索两种变体：手工制作的摘要(如词袋摘要)和学习的摘要(使用从右到左训练的反向语言模型生成的嵌入)。

Result: 在大规模预训练实验(30亿和80亿参数模型)中，FSP在数学、推理和编程基准测试上相比NTP和MTP都取得了改进。

Conclusion: FSP方法能够有效提升语言模型的长期推理能力，为长文本生成提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian

methods, our approach adaptively guides a mobile agent to collect high-utility
Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and
mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by
incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to

Motivation: 传统Hebbian学习在机器学习中存在连接更新无约束和缺乏反馈调节的问题，限制了其在复杂网络架构和任务中的有效扩展。

Method: 通过局部辅助非线性块整合正交性和结构信息保留，使用轻量级投影进行结构信息保留的反向传播，正交性约束控制更新幅度。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了Hebbian无监督学习规则在现代深度学习框架中的竞争力和潜力，证明了无需严格依赖反向传播的高效生物启发学习算法的可能性。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏虽然在GPU上能加速训练和推理，但在准确率上仍落后于无结构动态稀疏训练，主要原因是表达能力受限。

Method: 为每层学习一个排列矩阵与结构化权重矩阵联合优化，应用于块状、N:M和对角线三种典型结构。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上，该方法在90-95%稀疏度下达到与无结构基线相当的准确率，同时训练速度提升1.21倍，推理速度提升2.9倍。

Conclusion: 结构+学习排列的组合在准确率和效率之间找到了最佳平衡点。

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 时间序列数据具有动态特性，存在概念漂移和时间偏移两种分布漂移。现有研究主要关注时间偏移，而针对概念漂移的方法设计相对较少，需要统一解决这两种漂移问题。

Method: 提出ShifTS框架，首先缓解时间偏移，然后通过软注意力机制从回看和预测时间序列中寻找不变模式来处理概念漂移。该框架与具体方法无关，可应用于各种预测模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShifTS能持续提升无关模型的预测准确性，并优于现有的概念漂移、时间偏移及组合基线方法。

Conclusion: ShifTS框架有效解决了时间序列预测中的分布漂移问题，通过先处理时间偏移再处理概念漂移的统一方法，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型依赖人工特征工程，神经网络能自动学习特征但缺乏可解释性且需要专用硬件。需要一种既能自动学习有用特征又保持可解释性的方法。

Method: 使用LLM合成代码特征函数，结合决策树预测器。提出两种算法：FunSearch的适应版本学习特征，以及ID3算法的变体在叶节点分裂时按需生成新特征。

Result: 在象棋位置评估、图像和文本分类等任务中，LeaPR模型学习到高质量的非神经网络预测器，性能与神经网络相当。

Conclusion: LeaPR提供了一个灵活的学习可解释表示的范式，特征和预测都可以被直接检查和理解。

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

Motivation: 基础模型虽然具有广泛泛化能力，但极易受到对抗性扰动和后门攻击。现有后门移除方法需要昂贵的微调，且会降低模型在其他任务上的性能。本文旨在研究是否能在不损害模型通用能力的前提下消除后门。

Method: 研究发现后门在模型权重空间中与其他良性任务是解耦的，基于这一发现提出了一种简单的遗忘方法，利用这种解耦特性来隔离和消除后门的影响。

Result: 在CLIP模型和常见对抗性触发器上的实验表明，该方法实现了近乎完美的后门消除，平均保持96%的干净准确率。即使攻击未知，也能通过逆向工程触发器成功消除后门。

Conclusion: 该方法相比现有最先进防御方法，在遗忘效果和干净准确率之间取得了更好的平衡，为后门攻击防御提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

Motivation: 研究如何仅从数据集结构预测核回归模型的学习曲线，建立从数据集到模型性能的端到端理论框架。

Method: 提出HEA近似方法，分析各向异性数据分布下核的特征值和特征函数，将特征函数近似为数据的Hermite多项式。

Result: HEA在真实图像数据上表现良好，能准确预测学习曲线，且发现MLP在特征学习阶段也按HEA预测的顺序学习Hermite多项式。

Conclusion: HEA框架证明了在真实数据集上为复杂学习算法建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端理论是可行的。

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种在无导师情况下处理无界奖励的谨慎学习算法，通过选择可信区域和仅在证据证明无害时才执行动作来避免不可挽回的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键AI应用中，单个错误可能导致不可挽回的损失。传统序列决策理论假设所有错误都可恢复，但实际中奖励可能无下界，激进探索可能造成不可逆损害。

Method: 将问题建模为具有弃权选项的双动作上下文赌博机：观察输入后选择弃权（固定0奖励）或执行任务策略（奖励上界但下界无界）。提出基于谨慎的算法，仅在没有证据证明有害时才执行动作。

Result: 在i.i.d.输入假设下，建立了次线性遗憾保证，理论上证明了谨慎探索在高风险环境中安全部署学习智能体的有效性。

Conclusion: 谨慎探索策略能够在无导师情况下安全处理无界奖励问题，为高风险AI应用提供了理论保障。

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注强化学习后训练中出现的新行为，而本文从不同角度探讨是否能在推理时通过纯采样从基础模型中引出可比的推理能力。

Method: 受马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛技术启发，提出了一种利用基础模型自身似然的简单迭代采样算法。

Result: 在不同基础模型上，该算法在多种单次任务（如MATH500、HumanEval、GPQA）中显著提升推理能力，几乎匹配甚至超越强化学习后训练的效果，同时避免了多样性崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、精选数据集或验证器，在易验证领域之外具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

Method: 开发了新的扩散强制采样器，在每个前向传递中解码新token，同时通过循环并行细化这些token的潜在状态。

Result: 理论上证明该采样器比基线自回归生成在相同时间预算下更具表达力，实际在3.5B循环深度transformer上无需调优即可实现5倍加速。

Conclusion: 该采样器不仅为循环深度模型提供了高效的推理并行化机制，还表明这类模型可被视为强大的连续因果扩散语言模型。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

Motivation: 传统的IRT方法使用logistic链接函数，但这些变换会引入曲率破坏TVD-MI数据的可加性结构，导致模型拟合不佳。

Method: 从Gini熵最大化推导出剪裁线性模型，采用盒约束最小二乘公式处理边界饱和问题，使用恒等链接函数而非非线性变换。

Result: 在33%覆盖率下，获得0.117±0.008的留一RMSE，同时保持代理排名（Spearman ρ=0.972±0.015），评估次数比全密集方法减少三倍。不同评判者之间也表现出强一致性。

Conclusion: TVD-MI的几何结构最适合通过恒等映射来保持，这种方法可高效评估LLM，并适用于其他有界响应领域。

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了生物信息神经网络(BINNs)在作物基因组预测和选择中的应用，通过整合数千个SNP位点、多组学数据和先验生物知识，显著提高了预测准确性并揭示了非线性生物学关系。


<details>

Motivation: 传统基因型到表型(G2P)模型依赖直接映射，准确性有限，育种者需进行大规模昂贵田间试验。现有整合分子表型的模型在基因组选择时不可行，因为部署时无法获得这些数据。

Method: BINNs通过编码通路级归纳偏置，仅在训练时利用多组学数据，在推理时仅使用基因型数据。应用于玉米基因表达和多环境田间试验数据。

Result: 在稀疏数据条件下，BINN将秩相关准确性提高达56%，非线性识别GWAS/TWAS未能发现的基因。在合成代谢组学基准测试中，相比传统神经网络减少75%预测误差。

Conclusion: BINNs建立了利用中间领域信息提高基因组预测准确性的框架，揭示非线性生物学关系，可指导基因组选择、候选基因筛选、通路富集和基因编辑优先排序。

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

Motivation: 解决传统少步扩散模型中教师模型与学生模型格式不匹配导致的复杂蒸馏过程和质量-多样性权衡问题

Method: 修改学生流模型的输出层，使其预测无网络策略，该策略能在未来子步骤产生动态流速度，通过模仿蒸馏方法使用标准ℓ₂流匹配损失匹配教师模型的行为

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单的模仿教师行为实现了稳定可扩展的训练，避免了质量-多样性权衡，在少步生成任务中表现出色

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格学习架构在学习高频特征、感受野不足、对离散化敏感和计算效率之间存在微妙的权衡，需要一种能克服这些缺陷的新方法。

Method: 采用局部-全局学习方案，在网格梯度域应用学习的局部特征变换，然后求解泊松系统以全局传播标量特征更新。

Result: 在语义分割和参数化高度详细动画表面等任务中达到最先进性能，在学习变形方面显著优于现有表面学习架构。

Conclusion: PoissonNet提供了一个高效、可扩展的局部-全局学习框架，能够保留完整频率谱并提供真正的全局感受野，同时对网格三角化保持不可知性。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

Method: DOTechnique方法通过评估替代模型与高保真模型的决策等价性来确定有效性区域，结合领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间，提高计算效率。

Result: 以高速公路变道系统为例，展示了DOTechnique能够发现仿真模型的有效性区域，证明了该技术的潜力。

Conclusion: DOTechnique技术有潜力通过决策者上下文来支持发现模型有效性，为模型验证提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

### [204] [Do Slides Help? Multi-modal Context for Automatic Transcription of Conference Talks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13979)
*Supriti Sinhamahapatra,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种融合视觉信息（特别是演示文稿幻灯片）的多模态自动语音识别系统，用于改善科学演示场景下的语音识别性能，特别是在领域特定术语的识别上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SOTA ASR系统主要依赖声学信息而忽略了多模态上下文。视觉信息对于消歧和适应至关重要，特别是在科学演示场景中，演示文稿幻灯片包含重要的上下文信息。

Method: 1. 创建多模态演示基准，包括领域特定术语的自动分析；2. 探索用多模态信息增强语音模型的方法；3. 通过数据增强方法解决缺乏配套幻灯片数据集的问题；4. 使用增强数据集训练模型。

Result: 与基线模型相比，训练得到的模型在所有词汇上的词错误率相对降低了约34%，在领域特定术语上的词错误率相对降低了35%。

Conclusion: 集成演示文稿幻灯片等视觉信息可以显著提高ASR系统在科学演示场景下的性能，特别是在领域特定术语识别方面。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

TL;DR: 该论文研究大型语言模型能否进行复杂机器设计，通过BesiegeField测试平台评估LLM在组合式机器设计任务中的表现，并探索强化学习作为改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够学习创造性设计，特别是在组合式机器设计领域，这既是人类智能的标志也是工程实践的基础。

Method: 引入BesiegeField测试平台，基于Besiege游戏构建，支持基于部件的构造、物理模拟和奖励驱动评估。对最先进的LLM进行基准测试，并探索强化学习微调方法。

Result: 当前开源模型在空间推理、策略性组装和指令遵循等关键能力上表现不足，但通过强化学习微调可以带来改进。

Conclusion: 机器设计任务处于语言、机器设计和物理推理的交叉领域，仍存在开放挑战，但强化学习为提升LLM在该领域的能力提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在零相关情境下会系统性地产生因果幻觉，错误推断因果关系，支持了LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否像人类一样容易产生因果幻觉，特别是在医学等需要准确因果推理的领域中，这对LLMs的实际应用具有重要意义。

Method: 构建了1000个医学领域的零相关情境数据集，使用经典的认知科学范式——关联判断任务，让LLMs评估潜在原因的效力。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果幻觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，对在需要准确因果推理的领域中使用语言模型提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GammaZero提出了一种基于动作中心图表示的学习框架，用于在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中指导规划。该方法通过图神经网络学习小规模问题中的结构模式，并能够零样本泛化到更大规模的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要特定领域的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在开发一个统一的基于图的信念表示框架，实现跨问题规模的泛化能力。

Method: 将信念状态系统性地转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络和编码器-解码器架构从专家演示中学习价值函数和策略，然后将学习到的启发式方法应用于蒙特卡洛树搜索来指导更大问题的规划。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在与BetaZero相同规模问题上训练和测试时性能相当，同时能够零样本泛化到训练时未见过的2-4倍规模问题，在保持解质量的同时减少了搜索需求。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示实现了在POMDP中的可扩展规划，证明了基于图的结构模式学习能够有效支持跨问题规模的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种替代性的AI监管方法：要求大型AI实验室发布小型、开放的类比模型（从最大专有模型蒸馏训练而来），既确保AI安全又促进创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前沿AI模型监管提案因安全与创新的权衡而被搁置，需要一种既能确保安全又不阻碍创新的监管方法。

Method: 强制大型AI实验室发布小型开放类比模型，这些模型作为公共代理，允许广泛参与安全验证、可解释性研究和算法透明度工作。

Result: 研究表明，使用这些较小模型开发的安全和可解释性方法能有效推广到前沿规模系统，显著降低监管负担并加速安全进步。

Conclusion: 这种监管方法以最小额外成本显著促进公共利益，并通过加深对模型的理解来缓解安全与创新的权衡，实现两者的双赢。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共识声明生成框架缺乏结构来保证聚合多样化自由意见时的可证明公平性

Method: 将任务建模为多目标token级MDP，每个目标对应代理偏好；提出两种基于投票理论的方法：随机生成策略（保证ex-ante core）和单声明生成的平等主义福利最大化搜索

Result: 实验显示，基于平等主义目标的搜索生成的共识声明在代理对齐方面优于基线方法

Conclusion: 该框架为共识声明生成提供了可证明的公平性保证，扩展了投票理论概念到文本生成领域

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Motivation: 解决多建筑能源系统中空间-时间依赖关系利用不足、缺乏严格安全保证和系统复杂性的关键挑战。

Method: 集成GCN-Transformer融合架构的空间-时间图表示学习框架，以及结合控制屏障函数的安全约束多智能体强化学习算法。

Result: 在真实建筑数据集上，STEMS实现21%成本降低、18%排放减少，安全违规从35.1%降至5.6%，仅0.13的不适比例保持最佳舒适度。

Conclusion: STEMS框架在极端天气条件下表现出强大鲁棒性，并在不同建筑类型中保持有效性，为协调建筑能源管理提供了安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Method: 引入两个基础模型：主机代理模型（负责与用户交互、任务分解和协调）和任务生命周期模型（详细描述子任务从创建到完成的状态转换）。

Result: 定义了17个主机代理属性和14个任务生命周期属性，分为活性、安全性、完整性和公平性四类，用时序逻辑表达，支持形式化验证。

Conclusion: 这是首个严格基础的、领域无关的框架，用于系统分析、设计和部署正确、可靠、鲁棒的多AI代理系统。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像来预测文化遗产地的退化严重程度，在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态方法提升43%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地面临气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测（视觉检查或环境传感器单独使用）无法捕捉环境压力与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 采用改进的PerceiverIO架构，包含简化编码器（64D潜在空间）和自适应Barlow Twins损失函数，鼓励模态互补性而非冗余。

Result: 模型准确率达到76.9%，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比原始PerceiverIO提升25%。消融研究显示传感器单独为61.5%，图像单独为46.2%，证实了多模态协同效应。

Conclusion: 架构简洁性结合对比正则化能够在数据稀缺的文化遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized
scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to
maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel
inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.
To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete

Motivation: 尽管强化学习研究进展迅速，但在商业游戏中的应用仍然缓慢。论文旨在解决游戏AI社区在使用RL驱动NPC时面临的挑战，并探索RL与传统行为树的结合点。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在虚幻引擎中训练RL代理，创建多任务NPC，并提供了联合训练RL模型与行为树的详细方法。

Result: 展示了在受《最后生还者》启发的复杂3D环境中，RL与行为树结合方法能够成功训练具备多种技能的NPC。

Conclusion: RL与行为树的结合是一个关键但尚未充分探索的领域，该方法在实际游戏开发中具有可行性，能够帮助推动RL在商业游戏中的采用。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

TL;DR: JEDA是一个用于临床订单检索的双编码器系统，通过联合嵌入直接和上下文对话来实时触发临床订单检索，无需LLM重写，减少了延迟和不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话混合了明确指令和隐含推理，现有系统依赖LLM重写会带来延迟、不稳定性和不透明性，阻碍实时订单处理。

Method: 基于PubMedBERT初始化，使用重复安全对比目标进行微调，通过受限LLM指导将签名订单与互补表述绑定，包括仅命令、仅上下文、命令+上下文、上下文+推理等。

Result: JEDA在实践中取得了显著效果，大幅优于基础编码器和近期开源嵌入模型，具有噪声鲁棒性，减少了对不流畅和ASR错误的敏感性。

Conclusion: JEDA提供了一个快速、可解释、无需LLM的检索层，能够实时将环境上下文链接到可操作的临床订单。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数设计高度敏感，这限制了其广泛应用。现有方法需要人工设计复杂的奖励函数，过程繁琐且容易出错。

Method: 使用基础模型从自然语言规范自动生成奖励机；为每个奖励机状态关联语言嵌入以实现跨任务泛化；在多样化环境中进行实证验证。

Result: 在多个挑战性环境中证明了ARM-FM的有效性，包括展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型和奖励机形式化，实现了从自然语言到强化学习目标的自动化、组合式奖励设计，解决了奖励函数设计的核心挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个在线骚扰代理基准测试，包括多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈论的多代理模拟、三种针对记忆、规划和微调的越狱方法，以及混合评估框架。研究发现微调后的越狱攻击成功率高达95-99%，显著降低了模型拒绝率，并重现了人类攻击行为模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰通常发生在多轮交互中，需要开发更贴近现实的基准测试来评估LLM代理的安全性。

Method: 构建了包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法（针对记忆、规划和微调）的基准测试框架，并在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Gemini-2.0-flash模型上进行评估。

Result: 越狱微调使骚扰成功率从57-64%提升至96-99%，拒绝率降至1-2%。最常见的攻击行为是侮辱（85-88%）和谩骂（81-85%），封闭源模型表现出显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: 多轮和理论基础的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟人类骚扰动态，表明需要开发更强大的安全防护措施来保护在线平台安全。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench和DeepEval为系统评估深度研究能力提供了严格基础，识别了当前系统的局限性和改进方向，为推进可靠、有洞察力的深度研究系统提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

TL;DR: 提出Agentic Self-Learning (ASL)框架，通过多角色协同进化的强化学习实现无需人工标注数据的智能体自我学习，发现奖励信号来源和任务数据规模是开放域智能体训练的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不依赖人工标注数据集或预定义规则奖励的情况下，通过自我学习扩展基于LLM的智能体能力。

Method: 提出ASL框架，包含提示生成器、策略模型和生成式奖励模型，在共享工具环境和LLM骨干网络中形成任务生成、策略执行和评估的闭环强化学习。

Result: ASL实现稳定轮次增益，超越强基线方法，在零标注数据条件下持续改进，显示优异的样本效率和鲁棒性。生成式奖励模型的验证能力是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放域智能体学习的关键杠杆，多角色协同进化能够实现可扩展的自我改进智能体。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Motivation: 现有基准测试范围有限，缺乏根据模型推理能力演进调整难度的灵活性，需要更全面有效的评估方法。

Method: 从现有基准和奥林匹克竞赛中收集复杂推理问题，利用模型推理过程中的关键陈述自适应修改分析挑战，使用仿真软件生成可动态调整难度的问题。

Result: 收集了1300多个测试问题，基于o3和GPT-5等模型的推理能力迭代调整了MorphoBench的难度。

Conclusion: MorphoBench提高了模型推理评估的全面性和有效性，为改进大型模型的推理能力和科学稳健性提供了可靠指导。

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个保护大语言模型安全对齐的框架，通过安全敏感子空间和有害抵抗零空间来防止微调过程中安全行为退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在微调过程中容易丧失预训练的安全对齐能力，即使使用良性数据或低秩适配也会产生有害响应，需要保护安全机制。

Method: 使用协方差预处理的奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和安全无关组件，初始化低秩适配器时冻结安全相关部分，并构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的影响。

Result: 在多个下游任务上的实验表明，GuardSpace优于现有方法。对于Llama-2-7B-Chat在GSM8K上的微调，有害评分从14.4%降至3.6%，准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace框架能有效保护大语言模型在微调过程中的安全对齐，同时保持或提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够自动化繁琐的用户任务，但引入了新的风险，包括错位、恶意方攻击、智能体被破坏或用户数据被盗等安全问题。

Method: 重新利用多智能体系统中的黑板设计，创建模块化、可配置的测试平台，识别关键攻击向量（错位、恶意智能体、通信被破坏、数据中毒），并在三个协作MAS场景中实施四种代表性攻击。

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，提供工具来快速原型化、评估和迭代防御和设计，展示了框架的灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium旨在加速可信多智能体系统的进展，通过提供工具来研究安全、隐私和安全问题。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，为多智能体系统提供实时、无监督的步骤级错误检测和自我纠正，通过历史条件异常评分来防止错误传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在协作解决问题方面表现出色，但对级联错误很脆弱——单个错误步骤可能在智能体间传播并破坏整个轨迹。

Method: 采用两种互补设计：(1) 下一执行重构：从查询和交互历史预测下一步的嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；(2) 原型引导增强：学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验，在稀疏上下文下稳定重构和异常评分。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC始终优于所有基线方法，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；在不同MAS框架中都能带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: 元认知监控和针对性纠正能够以最小开销缓解错误传播，证实了该框架的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: AI4Service代表了AI从被动工具向主动伴侣的演进，Alpha-Service框架为实现这一愿景提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

TL;DR: IP-Merging是一种无需调优的方法，通过识别多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和数学大语言模型（Math LLM）中的推理相关参数，将其投影到MLLM子空间进行融合，从而直接提升MLLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的数学推理能力落后于纯文本大语言模型（LLM），研究者希望探索能否让MLLM直接从现成的数学LLM中吸收推理能力，而无需进行复杂的训练。

Method: 提出IP-Merging方法：1）识别MLLM和Math LLM中的推理相关参数；2）将这些参数投影到MLLM的子空间中；3）在子空间内合并参数。该方法无需调优，直接调整参数。

Result: 大量实验证明，IP-Merging方法能够在不损害MLLM其他能力的前提下，直接从Math LLM中增强MLLM的数学推理能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging是一种有效的参数融合方法，能够成功地将数学推理能力从纯文本LLM迁移到多模态LLM中，解决了参数空间对齐问题。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的移动设备控制方法大多依赖直接的状态到动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划，导致在新任务或未见UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层架构：高层推理模型和低层动作模型联合优化。将多步决策重新表述为单步子目标序列，并提出前瞻优势函数，利用低层模型的执行反馈指导高层优化，缓解长视野任务中的路径爆炸问题。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于提示式(17.7%)、监督式(54.5%)和强化学习式(71.9%)方法。在ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中表现出竞争力的零样本泛化能力，在AndroidWorld基准测试中随骨干网络增大而有效扩展。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent通过分层设计和联合优化策略，在移动设备控制任务中实现了最先进的性能，展示了在复杂场景下的强适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务中的挑战，以及多智能体系统存在的高推理成本、长延迟和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，通过端到端训练将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一模型中，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型。

Result: 训练后的模型在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功地将多智能体系统的结构化推理和规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著提升了性能并降低了推理成本。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

TL;DR: JSPLIT是一个基于分类学的框架，用于解决大型语言模型使用MCP工具时提示膨胀的问题。它通过层次化分类和查询驱动的工具选择，显著减少提示大小并提高工具选择准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统发展，用户期望超越简单的文本交互，需要LLM与外部工具交互。但工具数量增加导致提示膨胀，带来高token成本、延迟增加和任务成功率下降的问题。

Method: JSPLIT将工具组织成层次化分类学，使用用户提示基于查询和分类结构识别并仅包含最相关的工具。包括分类设计、工具选择算法和评估数据集。

Result: JSPLIT显著减少了提示大小，且未显著影响代理的响应能力。当可用工具数量大幅增加时，JSPLIT甚至提高了代理的工具选择准确性，在降低成本的同时改善高复杂度环境中的任务成功率。

Conclusion: JSPLIT框架有效解决了MCP工具使用中的提示膨胀问题，通过分类学驱动的工具选择方法，在减少成本的同时提升系统性能，特别适用于工具数量庞大的复杂代理环境。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Motivation: 神经符号AI模型在概念未被直接监督时容易出现推理捷径，这会损害模型解释性、分布外性能及可靠性。目前相关研究分散，需要统一视角来帮助理解和解决这一问题。

Method: 通过温和介绍推理捷径，直观讨论其成因和后果，回顾现有理论特征，详细阐述包括缓解和意识策略在内的应对方法，并分析其优缺点。

Conclusion: 本文通过重新表述高级材料为易于理解的形式，旨在降低解决推理捷径问题的门槛，为开发可靠的神经符号AI和可信AI模型做出贡献。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM代理是否能超越智能问题解决工具，成为具有自主规划、任务设计和推理能力的独立实体。

Method: 采用开放环境设置，增强预训练LLM代理的能力，使其能够生成自己的任务、积累知识并与环境广泛交互。

Result: 代理能可靠执行复杂多步指令，跨运行存储和重用信息，提出并解决自己的任务，但对提示设计敏感，容易重复生成任务，无法形成自我表征。

Conclusion: 研究展示了将预训练LLM转向开放性的前景和当前局限，为未来训练代理管理记忆、有效探索和追求抽象长期目标指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ColorBench，一个用于评估移动代理在复杂长时任务中性能的图结构基准框架，支持多有效解决方案评估和准动态交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动代理评估方法存在局限：离线静态基准只能验证单一预设路径，而在线动态测试受限于真实设备的复杂性和不可重现性，两者都无法全面评估代理能力。

Method: 通过建模真实设备交互中的有限状态，实现动态行为的静态模拟，构建图结构基准框架。开发ColorBench基准，包含175个任务（74个单应用、101个跨应用），平均长度超过13步，每个任务包含至少两条正确路径和典型错误路径。

Conclusion: ColorBench框架成功弥合了离线和在线评估之间的差距，增强了测试稳定性，为提升代理在复杂长时问题上的性能提供了有效评估工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

*Rikard Rosenbacke,Carl Rosenbacke,Victor Rosenbacke,Martin McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人机交互中的认知和认识论漂移，通过三个维度（地图vs领土、直觉vs理性、冲突vs确认）来增强AI部署的透明度和批判意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然流畅且具有情感共鸣，但基于统计预测而非有根据的推理，存在幻觉风险。它们实现了系统1认知的规模化：快速、联想且具有说服力，但缺乏反思或证伪。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维框架：(i)地图vs领土，区分现实表征与现实本身；(ii)直觉vs理性，基于双过程理论分离快速情感判断与缓慢反思思维；(iii)冲突vs确认，检验观点是通过批判性测试还是简单相互验证。

Result: Rose-Frame不试图用更多数据或规则修复LLM，而是提供一个反思工具，使模型局限性和用户假设可见，实现更透明和批判性意识强的AI部署。

Conclusion: 将对齐重新定义为认知治理：无论是人类还是人工智能的直觉，都必须受到人类理性的治理。只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，才能将机器的流畅性与人类的理解对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在公共卫生领域有巨大潜力，但如果不系统关注算法偏见，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康不平等。需要评估当前研究对算法偏见的识别、讨论和报告情况。

Method: 开发了RABAT评估工具，整合了Cochrane偏见风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表等成熟框架，对35篇同行评审研究进行了系统文献综述。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据抽样和缺失数据实践有良好记录，但大多数研究忽略了明确的公平性框架、亚组分析以及对潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性导向框架，为公共卫生ML从业者提供可操作建议，确保算法创新促进健康公平而非损害公平。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

Motivation: 传统检索系统无法在网络安全威胁、行为和防御之间进行清晰可逆的推理，需要一种能够将自然语言查询与结构化知识图谱上的可执行推理相结合的框架。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测文本中的逻辑关系链，以及图执行器遍历TITAN本体图来检索事实答案和支持证据，使用基于MITRE的双向类型化图谱。

Result: 创建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示TITAN能够生成语法有效且语义连贯的推理路径，可在底层图上确定性执行。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询与结构化知识图谱推理的连接，支持可执行的威胁情报分析。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

Conclusion: 成功将理论基础的功利算法配置方法提升到实用水平，并展示了如何评估算法选择解决方案对效用函数变化的鲁棒性

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案，可应用于各种基于任务向量的合并方法，显著提升性能

Conclusion: PAVE方法能有效净化任务向量，消除冗余冲突，提高模型合并效果，适用于多种合并方法、任务和模型架构

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要基于非结构化文本预训练，缺乏对结构化地理实体和序列移动模式的理解，且难以整合季节、天气、节假日等世界知识和用户画像信息。

Method: CoAST包含两个阶段：(1) 推荐知识获取：在去标识化的用户时空轨迹数据上进行持续预训练；(2) 认知对齐：通过监督微调和强化学习将认知判断与人类偏好对齐。

Conclusion: CoAST框架成功解决了大语言模型在POI推荐任务中对时空模式理解不足的问题，通过认知对齐显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

<details>

Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在函数调用等结构化输出领域的应用研究不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了首个细粒度调用内过程监督数据集，使用函数掩码技术自动标注步骤级奖励；开发ToolPRM过程奖励模型来评分单个函数调用的内部步骤；结合细粒度波束搜索进行推理扩展。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型；配备ToolPRM的推理扩展技术显著提升了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则："多探索少保留"，这是由于结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复性特征决定的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to

*Ruotian Peng,Yi Ren,Zhouliang Yu,Weiyang Liu,Yandong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文分析了RLVR方法存在的系统性偏差问题，提出了SimKO方法来缓解概率过度集中现象，从而提高探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在系统性偏差，倾向于利用而非探索，表现为pass@1性能提升但pass@K(K>1)性能下降。

Method: 通过分析训练动态发现概率集中效应，提出SimKO方法：对于验证正确的响应，提升top-K候选概率；对于验证错误的响应，对top-1候选施加更强惩罚。

Result: SimKO在各种数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，对广泛的K值范围都能获得更高的pass@K性能。

Conclusion: SimKO提供了一种简单有效的方法来改善RLVR的探索能力，缓解概率过度集中问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

*Dominik Jehle,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个基于LLM的代理系统，通过交互式循环选择性获取必要元信息，显著减少NL2SQL任务中的token使用量，降低成本的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长、token数量多、处理成本高。

Method: 采用代理式交互循环，在推理框架中让LLM选择性请求必要信息，而非一次性提供所有元信息。

Result: 在23个数据库和100个表问答任务上测试，token使用量减少高达87%，成本大幅降低且性能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent通过选择性信息获取策略，有效解决了NL2SQL任务中元信息过多导致的成本问题。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RoboGPT-R1，一个两阶段微调框架，通过监督训练获取基础知识，然后使用强化学习来提升视觉空间理解和推理能力，在EmbodiedBench基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在规划任务中取得了成功，但在复杂现实环境中执行长视距操作任务时仍面临挑战，主要受限于常识和推理能力不足。

Method: 采用两阶段微调框架：监督训练通过专家序列获取基础知识，然后使用强化学习解决模型在视觉空间理解和推理方面的不足，设计了考虑长视距性能和动作约束的基于规则的奖励函数。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练得到的推理模型，在EmbodiedBench基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini 21.33%，并超过其他在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上训练的工作20.33%。

Conclusion: RoboGPT-R1框架通过结合监督训练和强化学习，有效提升了具身智能体在长视距操作任务中的推理能力，实现了更好的物理理解和动作序列一致性。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

### [246] [Boosting Instruction Following at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14842)
*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过增加指令遵循率来提高LLM提示指令的可靠性，在2个指令时提升7个百分点，10个指令时提升4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常通过修改提示来影响LLM行为，但仅添加更多指令无法保证它们会被遵循，需要提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 引入Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，并创建SCALEDIF基准测试，包含最多10个指令的数据样本，同时开发定量冲突评分工具。

Result: Instruction Boosting显著提高了指令遵循率，同时发现性能下降与指令间的紧张和冲突程度相关。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting有效提升LLM指令遵循可靠性，冲突评分工具能为开发者提供关于额外提示指令对模型性能影响的反馈。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

*Zhuo-Yang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个紧凑的形式理论来描述和测量由领域先验引导的LLM辅助迭代搜索，将智能体建模为模糊关系算子，并通过覆盖生成函数来衡量可达性难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学发现中取得进展，但搜索效果取决于如何将领域先验编码为操作结构化的假设空间。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子，通过安全包络约束智能体；使用覆盖生成函数加权所有可达路径，衡量可达性难度，并提供几何解释。

Result: 提供了最简单的可测试推断，并通过多数投票实例进行验证，为测量智能体及其搜索空间提供了可行的语言和操作工具。

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统的形式化描述框架，能够有效测量智能体和搜索空间。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

### [249] [The Gatekeeper Knows Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14881)
*Fikresilase Wondmeneh Abebayew*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Gatekeeper Protocol框架，通过低保真潜在状态表示和按需请求高保真上下文的方式，解决LLM代理在复杂知识系统中存在的上下文窗口限制和状态不同步问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自主代理部署时，受限于有限的上下文窗口和状态不同步问题，导致输出不可靠、行为不可预测，特别是在与代码库和文档等结构化知识系统交互时效率低下。

Method: 设计Gatekeeper Protocol框架，让代理先在低保真潜在状态表示上进行操作和推理，然后按需请求高保真上下文。所有交互通过统一的JSON格式进行，作为声明式、状态同步的协议。

Result: 在软件开发的Sage参考实现中，该方法显著提高了代理可靠性，通过最小化token消耗改善了计算效率，并实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: Gatekeeper Protocol为在任何结构化知识领域构建更稳健、可预测和基于现实的AI代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需标注数据或模型权重更新的强化学习代理，通过生成针对性网络搜索查询来获取外部证据，迭代优化企业智能平台中第三方日志的模式映射准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要集成众多第三方供应商的日志，但供应商文档在测试时常常不可用、不匹配、格式混乱或不完整，导致模式映射面临挑战。

Method: 使用强化学习代理：1)识别模糊的字段映射尝试；2)生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3)应用基于置信度的奖励迭代优化映射。

Result: 将Microsoft Defender for Endpoint日志转换为通用模式，映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)，最终达到93.94%(100次迭代后)，同时将需要专家审查的低置信度映射减少了85%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种证据驱动、透明的解决方案，为更稳健、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、适应性强和协作的行业问题解决铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Motivation: 生成式验证器虽然性能优秀但计算成本过高，限制了实际应用。作者希望探索更高效的验证方法，在保证性能的同时降低计算开销。

Method: 采用判别式验证器与自一致性相结合的混合方法，在固定计算预算下进行测试时扩展。

Conclusion: 预算感知的判别式验证不仅是对自一致性的免费升级，而且是比昂贵的生成式技术更有效和高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Conclusion: 本研究为多模态抑郁检测的未来研究奠定了基础，证明了多模态融合的有效性和预训练嵌入的优势。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

TL;DR: 将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk来评估推理系统的稳定性，在LLMs中发现脆弱内部动态与错误校准和幻觉相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论联系起来，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过度自信提供理论框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk，结合频谱裕度、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大等指标，在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: 在线性高斯模拟中，高H-Risk预测过度自信错误；在LLMs中，脆弱内部动态与错误校准和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉有混合效果。

Conclusion: 建立了康德自我限制与反馈控制之间的结构性桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过度自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树搜索和外部工具验证的自动过程监督框架，通过MCTS构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，结合步骤级验证和全局结果评估，显著提升了过程奖励模型的质量和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型面临三大挑战：噪声奖励、低事实保真度以及与步骤级推理目标的不对齐。这些问题源于依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估，或仅从最终结果推断步骤质量的蒙特卡洛估计方法。

Method: 1. 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，实现细粒度信用分配
2. 通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤，提供基于执行的正确性信号
3. 设计混合奖励聚合机制，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈
4. 将奖励信号格式化为增强推理的生成结构，提高可解释性

Result: 仅使用4万自动标注样本（最佳自动监督PRM数据量的10%），在ProcessBench上实现了高达26%的相对性能提升。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，甚至超越了基于人工标注训练的PRM。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM为高质量过程级推理提供了一条可扩展且可验证的路径，通过树引导和保真度感知的框架有效解决了现有PRM的核心局限性。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Motivation: 现实世界中多模态虚假内容类型未知，现有方法分别针对人类制作或AI生成的虚假内容，缺乏统一检测框架。

Method: 构建OmniFake数据集，提出UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器和归因链式思维机制。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假内容类型上均表现稳健，优于专门化基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界多模态虚假内容检测提供了实用解决方案，实现了对未知类型虚假内容的统一检测。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.
