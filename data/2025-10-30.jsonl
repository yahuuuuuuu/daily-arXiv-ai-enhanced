However, few studies have\nexplored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we\npropose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically\nleverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework\nincorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module\n(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and\nglobal enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which\ncaptures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical\nreceptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative\nmultimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a\nsynchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy\ncontrols (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences\nduring a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid\nresource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this\ndataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and\nfeature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in\ndistinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic\nperformance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and\nmodality-specific contributions."}

Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to\nsystematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing\ncurrent techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,\nfocusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient\nTraining, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)\nEfficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and\nutilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods\nwithin this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational\nreference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,\ndelineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We\nmaintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:\nhttps://evla-survey.github.io/"}

To understand how VLMs process\nculturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive\nneurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs\nassociated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons\nare important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they\nare located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture\nselectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by\ndifferent identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural\ngroups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately\nharms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having\nminimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -\nContrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing\nprobability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive\nneurons.

However,\nthe complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by\nlarge scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or\nrelational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing\nautomatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,\noften suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor\nadaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA\n(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that\nautonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex\nindustrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided\nself-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea\nAgents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,\nand implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and\nupdates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable\ncontinual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution\nalgorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to\nbalance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive\nexperiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate\nexplainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model\nperformance while reducing manual effort.

Traditional\napproaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits\nthe opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,\nwe propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection\nand prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may\nindicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced\nperformance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to\ndetect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for\nevaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we\nemployed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to\nmodel temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%\nprediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing\naccessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as\ntraditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to\npredict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to\na more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take\nprecautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications."}

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills.

Consequently, ATR models trained on\nsynthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions\nto this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the\nimpact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a\nnew approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are\ngrounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic\ndatasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a\nscattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing\nstrategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM\nand Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of\nalmost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements."}

Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced\nperformance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to\ndetect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for\nevaluating medical ML models with class imbalance.

We instead consider linearity\ngrafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than\nreducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require\nrelaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why\nlinearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the\n$l_\\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear\nactivation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a\ntighter local Lipschitz constant.

The framework is implemented using two\nensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and\nvalidated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.\nExperimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the\nnonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,\nachieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that\ngeometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local\nstructural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The\nproposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,\nproviding a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and\nerror analysis of large-scale point clouds."}
