However,\nthis assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by\nboth the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the\nperformance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current\nstudies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally\nAutocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed\nto systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic\nforecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a\nrandom Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a\nspatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic\ndependencies.

However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained\nrepresentations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability\nsimultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation\ninterpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable\nsemantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,\nonly the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas\nthe uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we\npropose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the\ninformation loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies\nthe representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation\ninterpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that\nthe interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,\nrepresentations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable\nsemantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further\nsupports two benefits to the pre-trained representations.

Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy\nand histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely\ntime-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of\ndigital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in\nenhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a\nconvolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized\nfor the classification of colorectal tissue images.

Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to\nprompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then\nintroduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information\nto the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting\nfully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for\nICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the\nscalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate\nthat our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs."}

This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports\nbe leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works\nare limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them\nto predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with\nlabels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we\nconduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both\npre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,\n12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings\nreveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for\ndownstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the\ntext; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be\ndetrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead\nto significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training\nmethod in certain settings.

Intuitively, they\ncould: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for\ndownstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic\nnature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two\npatches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode\nIsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,\nwhich reaches over 90% accuracy.

While deep learning\nmodels, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,\nthey suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during\nlong-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible\nartifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which\nstruggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To\naddress this, we introduce a novel \\textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction\n(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of\ndeep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy\nof RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric\nestimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently\nretrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The\ntrue future evolution of this analog then serves as a \\textbf{reference\ntarget}.

Previous research has\ndemonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden\ndimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to\nthe widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive\nlow-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed\nbottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply\nRoPE.

Based on\nthese insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework.

Empirical\nevaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE\n= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across\nregression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results\ndemonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical\narchitectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable\npredictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current\nlimitations."}

We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on\ntwo popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.\nTest-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt\nto novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional\nfine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym.

Causal discovery in time series is\nhindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal\nrelationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A\ncommon approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.\nTraditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of\nthe resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple\nvalid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We\npropose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based\ncausal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS\neffectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic\ngraph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We\nformalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the\nadditive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to\nenable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the\napproach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a\nscalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery.

However, most existing\naugmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes\n-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality\nsynthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is\nessential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as\ntraining data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and\nnetwork architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a\nnovel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the\ndata generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data\nvia downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight\nallocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic\nsample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data\ngeneration process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the\nsynthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative\nmodel to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts\ngeneration policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each\ngeneration round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying\ncomplexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves\nsuperior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over\nprevious SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that\nUtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating\nthe effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to\ntask utility-centric data augmentation."}

Kording"], "title": "Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?", "comment": "Accepted as a Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that\ncollectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human\ncognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object\nrepresentations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in\nmemory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While\nprior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)\nexplicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability\nnaturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they\ncould: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for\ndownstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic\nnature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two\npatches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode\nIsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,\nwhich reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability\nemerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker\nin ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial\narchitectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining\nobjectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a\nlow-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal\nactively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations\ndegrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,\nimplying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining\nobjective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and\nhighlight how symbolic knowledge of \"which parts belong together\" emerges\nnaturally in a connectionist system."}

In camera-guided video generation\nwith a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with\nthe generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address\nthis, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire\nsequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of\nthe predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm\nthat extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video\ngeneration. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained\nmodel, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with\nDiffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show\nalready provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce\nOmni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching\nby conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed\nloop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS\nachieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,\nframe-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera\npaths, including Oscar Reutersv\\\"ard's Impossible Staircase.
