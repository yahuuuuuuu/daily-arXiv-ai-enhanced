### [1] [ESCA: Contextualizing Embodied Agents via Scene-Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15963)
*Jiani Huang,Amish Sethi,Matthew Kuo,Mayank Keoliya,Neelay Velingker,JungHo Jung,Ser-Nam Lim,Ziyang Li,Mayur Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ESCA框架和SGClip模型，通过结构化时空理解来情境化具身智能体，无需人工标注的场景图数据，在具身环境中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要依赖高层视觉-声音-文本对，缺乏像素级视觉内容与文本语义的细粒度结构化对齐

Method: 开发了SGClip模型，基于CLIP架构，通过神经符号学习管道在8.7万+开放域视频上训练，支持基于提示的推理和任务特定微调

Result: 在场景图生成和动作定位基准测试中表现出色，显著减少智能体感知错误，使开源模型超越专有基线

Conclusion: ESCA框架通过结构化空间-时间理解持续改进开源和商业多模态大语言模型，在具身环境中实现最先进性能

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

### [2] [CrossRay3D: Geometry and Distribution Guidance for Efficient Multimodal 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15991)
*Huiming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CrossRay3D稀疏多模态检测器，通过射线感知监督和类别平衡监督提升token表示质量，在nuScenes基准上达到SOTA性能，且运行速度更快、对传感器缺失具有强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏检测器忽视token表示质量，导致前景质量次优和性能受限。研究发现几何结构保持和类别分布是提升稀疏检测器性能的关键。

Method: 提出稀疏选择器(SS)，包含射线感知监督(RAS)保持几何信息、类别平衡监督自适应重加权类别语义重要性、射线位置编码(Ray PE)解决LiDAR与图像模态分布差异，集成到端到端的CrossRay3D检测器中。

Result: 在nuScenes基准上达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，运行速度比其他领先方法快1.84倍，在LiDAR或相机数据部分或完全缺失的场景下仍表现强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrossRay3D通过改进token表示质量，在保持稀疏检测器计算效率优势的同时，显著提升了检测性能和对传感器缺失的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

### [3] [InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16017)
*Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed,Abdullah Yahya Abdullah Omaisan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个基于CCTV监控的智能城市基础设施缺陷检测系统，使用YOLO进行多缺陷检测和分割，并通过视觉语言模型生成结构化维修计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能城市基础设施监控需求增长，手动检查成本高且危险，现有自动系统通常只能处理单一缺陷类型或无法提供结构化输出指导维修工作。

Method: 利用街道CCTV流进行多缺陷检测和分割，使用YOLO系列目标检测器，然后将检测结果传递给视觉语言模型进行场景感知总结，生成包含事件描述、推荐工具、尺寸、维修计划和紧急警报的JSON格式结构化行动计划。

Result: 在公共数据集和捕获的CCTV片段上的实验评估表明，系统能准确识别多种缺陷并生成连贯的总结。

Conclusion: 讨论了将系统扩展到城市范围部署的挑战和方向。

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of
closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop
cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require
timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing
automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide
unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper
proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

### [4] [IAD-GPT: Advancing Visual Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16036)
*Zewen Li,Zitong Yu,Qilang Ye,Weicheng Xie,Wei Zhuo,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-GPT是一种基于多模态大语言模型的工业异常检测新范式，通过异常提示生成器、文本引导增强器和多掩码融合模块，结合文本语义与图像信息实现先进的异常检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业异常检测方法缺乏多轮人机对话和详细描述能力，而基于大模型的方法尚未充分发挥其在异常检测任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用异常提示生成器生成详细异常提示，通过文本引导增强器增强视觉定位能力，设计多掩码融合模块引入掩码作为专家知识。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在自监督和少样本异常检测与分割任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: IAD-GPT成功结合了多模态大语言模型的因果推理能力与工业异常检测需求，提供了一种有效的异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种放射学报告模式（自由文本、结构化报告、AI辅助结构化报告）对图像分析行为、诊断准确性、效率和用户体验的影响。结果显示AI辅助结构化报告在诊断准确性和效率方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化报告和人工智能可能改变放射科医生与影像研究的交互方式，需要评估不同报告模式对放射学实践的影响。

Method: 前瞻性研究（2024年7-12月），8名读者（4名新手和4名非新手）每人分析35张床旁胸片，使用定制查看器和眼动追踪系统，比较三种报告模式的表现。

Result: AI辅助结构化报告的诊断准确性最高（κ=0.71），报告时间最短（25±9秒），眼动指标显示视觉注意力更集中于图像区域，且是用户首选模式。

Conclusion: 结构化报告通过引导视觉注意力提高效率，而AI预填充的结构化报告进一步提升了诊断准确性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

### [6] [Data-Driven Analysis of Intersectional Bias in Image Classification: A Framework with Bias-Weighted Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16072)
*Farjana Yesmin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析图像分类中交叉偏见的框架IFEF和缓解偏见的BWA数据增强方法，在Open Images V7数据集上显著提升了少数群体的准确率并减少了公平性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在不平衡数据集上训练时会产生交叉偏见——由对象类别和环境条件等多属性交互引起的系统性错误。

Method: 引入交叉公平性评估框架(IFEF)结合定量公平性指标和可解释性工具，提出基于子群分布统计的自适应变换强度偏置加权增强(BWA)方法。

Result: 在Open Images V7数据集上，BWA将代表性不足的类别-环境交叉点的准确率提高了24个百分点，公平性指标差异减少了35%，统计显著性p<0.05。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析和解决图像分类系统中的交叉偏见提供了一个可复现的途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

### [7] [Differentiable, Bit-shifting, and Scalable Quantization without training neural network from scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16088)
*Zia Badar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可微分的神经网络量化方法，支持n位量化，在ImageNet数据集上使用ResNet18进行权重量化时，仅比全精度准确率低不到1%，且只需15个训练周期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法存在两个主要问题：一是大多使用不可微分的方法，在反向传播中手动设置导数，影响学习能力；二是之前的移位/对数量化方法要么避免激活量化，要么准确率较低。

Method: 提出可微分的量化方法，支持n位量化，特别是移位位量化，能够同时量化权重和激活值，且不需要高精度乘法。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，仅权重量化时准确率比全精度低不到1%；权重和激活同时量化时，准确率与最先进方法相当，仅需15个训练周期。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种收敛到最优神经网络的可证明方法，在保持高准确率的同时显著减少了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

### [8] [GuideFlow3D: Optimization-Guided Rectified Flow For Appearance Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16136)
*Sayan Deb Sarkar,Sinisa Stekovic,Vincent Lepetit,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过引导预训练的整流流模型来将外观（图像或文本）转移到3D资产上，解决了在输入和外观对象几何差异显著时的失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在输入和外观对象的几何形状差异较大时表现不佳，直接应用3D生成模型无法产生令人满意的结果，需要一种更有效的外观转移方法。

Method: 基于通用引导的原则，在预训练的整流流模型采样过程中定期添加引导，引导可建模为可微分损失函数，包括外观感知损失和自相似性损失。

Result: 该方法成功地将纹理和几何细节转移到输入3D资产，在定性和定量评估中均优于基线方法，并通过GPT评估系统和用户研究验证了效果。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可扩展到不同类型的扩散模型和引导函数，为游戏、增强现实和数字内容创作等应用提供了有效的外观转移解决方案。

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

*Jianhan Lin,Yuchu Qin,Shuai Gao,Yikang Rui,Jie Liu,Yanjie Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出StripRFNet网络用于道路损伤检测，通过三个模块解决形状多样性、细长裂缝检测和小尺度损伤识别问题，在RDD2022基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路表面损伤威胁交通安全并阻碍可持续城市发展，但准确检测面临挑战：损伤形状多样、细长裂缝难以捕捉、小尺度损伤识别错误率高。

Method: StripRFNet包含三个模块：形状感知模块（SPM）通过大分离核注意力增强形状判别；条带感受野模块（SRFM）使用大条带卷积和池化捕捉细长裂缝特征；小尺度增强模块（SSEM）利用高分辨率P2特征图、专用检测头和动态上采样改善小目标检测。

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中，StripRFNet超越现有方法。在中国子集上，F1分数、mAP50和mAP50:95分别比基线提高4.4、2.9和3.4个百分点。在全数据集上达到80.33%的最高F1分数，同时保持有竞争力的推理速度。

Conclusion: StripRFNet实现了最先进的准确性和实时效率，为智能道路维护和可持续基础设施管理提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

*Xiangyu Mu,Dongliang Zhou,Jie Hou,Haijun Zhang,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M2HVideo框架，将模特假人视频转换为身份可控、逼真的人类视频，解决了头部与身体运动不对齐和身份漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模特假人服装展示成本低但缺乏真实感和表现细节，需要将假人视频转换为逼真的人类视频。

Method: 使用动态姿态感知头部编码器融合面部语义和身体姿态，引入镜像损失和分布感知适配器增强时间一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，M2HVideo在服装一致性、身份保持和视频保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M2HVideo框架成功解决了假人到人类视频生成的关键挑战，实现了高质量的身份可控视频生成。

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to
real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and
expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Nishad Sahu,Shounak Sural,Aditya Satish Patil,Ragunathan,Rajkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjectTransforms是一种通过对象特定变换来量化和减少视觉目标检测中不确定性的技术，在训练和推理时分别提高鲁棒性和量化预测不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中可靠的感知对安全决策至关重要，但基于视觉的目标检测神经网络容易受到数据偏差和分布偏移等不确定性因素的影响。

Method: 在训练时对单个对象进行颜色空间扰动并使用扩散模型生成多样化的行人实例；在推理时对检测到的对象应用扰动，利用检测分数的方差实时量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在NuImages 10K数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有对象类别上都带来了显著的准确率提升和不确定性减少，并且对假阳性预测了更高的不确定性值。

Conclusion: ObjectTransforms作为一种轻量级但有效的机制，在训练和推理时分别具有减少和量化视觉感知不确定性的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

Abstract: Thrombectomy is one of the most effective treatments for ischemic stroke, but
it is resource and personnel-intensive. We propose employing deep learning to
automate critical aspects of thrombectomy, thereby enhancing efficiency and
safety. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised framework that classifies
various skeletal landmarks using a regression-based pretext task. Our
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both
regression and classification tasks. Notably, our results indicate that the
positional pretext task significantly enhances downstream classification
performance. Future work will focus on extending this framework toward fully
autonomous C-arm control, aiming to optimize trajectories from the pelvis to
the head during stroke thrombectomy procedures. All code used is available at

TL;DR: DuetMatch是一个用于医学图像分割的双分支半监督框架，通过异步优化编码器和解码器，结合解耦dropout扰动、配对CutMix交叉指导和一致性匹配等技术，在脑MRI分割数据集上取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注数据有限，半监督学习能从不完美监督中学习。教师-学生框架虽受欢迎，但联合优化整个网络会影响收敛和稳定性，特别是在挑战性场景中。

Method: 提出DuetMatch双分支框架，异步优化编码器或解码器；引入解耦dropout扰动增强噪声条件下的正则化；设计配对CutMix交叉指导通过增强输入对交换伪标签；提出一致性匹配使用冻结教师模型的稳定预测来精炼标签。

Conclusion: DuetMatch通过创新的异步优化和多种正则化技术，成功解决了医学图像半监督分割中的收敛稳定性和噪声鲁棒性问题，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes
semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

Motivation: 临床工作流程依赖手动对齐C臂，这会增加辐射暴露和手术延迟，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和安全性。

Method: 使用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，结合概率损失和骨骼姿态正则化，采用保形预测校准不确定性，生成3D置信区域。

Result: 在DeepDRR生成的合成X射线数据集上验证，显示出强大的定位精度和良好校准的预测边界。

Conclusion: 该管道有潜力成为安全可靠自主C臂系统的组成部分，能够减少辐射暴露和手术时间。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度生成模型生成的图像质量尚不及传统摄影方法，生产流程中需要人工图像质量评估，这个过程既慢又昂贵，特别是因为自动生成图像通过质量标准的比例很低。

Method: 引入自动预过滤阶段来减少IQA工作量，提出了一个估计成本节省的公式，该公式取决于通用IQA引擎的精度和通过率。

Result: 在背景修复的用例中应用该公式，通过简单的AutoML解决方案实现了51.61%的成本节省。

Conclusion: 自动预过滤可以显著降低获得高质量图像的平均成本，提高发送给审核的图像的整体质量。

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，使用结构化文本作为中间空间来桥接fMRI信号和图像重建具有重要意义，fMRI信号与语言模型的文本空间更相似，而非基于视觉的空间或联合文本图像空间。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge
in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct
visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a
latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct
images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is
to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces
images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best
supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual
stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more
similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based
space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the
generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of
visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and
relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that
Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate
representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric
diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to
reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module
that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align
with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an
8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of
using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and
image reconstruction.

*Nyle Siddiqui,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为StretchySnake的灵活训练方法，通过动态调整时空分辨率来增强状态空间模型在视频理解中的适应性，解决了现有方法在未见过时空分辨率上的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解训练方法主要针对Transformer设计，无法充分利用状态空间模型的独特优势。固定分辨率和视频长度的训练导致模型在未见时空分辨率上性能下降，限制了模型处理不同长度视频的能力。

Method: 提出灵活训练方法，在训练过程中采样不同时空分辨率的视频，并动态插值模型权重以适应任意时空尺度。比较了五种不同的灵活训练变体，确定了最适合视频状态空间模型的策略。

Result: 在短动作（UCF-101、HMDB-51）和长动作（COIN、Breakfast）基准测试中，StretchySnake比Transformer和状态空间模型基线性能提升高达28%，在细粒度动作数据集（SSV2、Diving-48）上表现出强大的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单的即插即用训练方案，使视频状态空间模型在各种动作识别场景中更加鲁棒、分辨率无关且高效。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to
transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state
recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,
whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training
methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to
fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are
often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic
scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models
suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and
temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal
inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a
model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.
Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves
the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying
temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates
model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,
which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to
seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,
complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of
flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On
short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,
StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,
with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,
our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more
robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有CNN模型难以捕捉全局面部特征，Vision Transformers能建模长距离空间关系但存在二次复杂度问题，需要结合两种模型的优势。

Method: 使用异构集成架构，ViT主干捕获全局面部结构和对称性，Mamba主干以线性复杂度建模长距离依赖关系，专注于序列特征和纹理。

Conclusion: VM-BeautyNet为计算美学提供了一个强大的新架构范式，通过融合ViT和Mamba模型的优势，有效解决了面部美颜预测中的挑战。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision
task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic
perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture
the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment.
Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range
spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This
paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture,
\textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths
of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in
State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial
structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range
dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and
textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our
proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
\textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}.
Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability
analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two
backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and
presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔鳞状细胞癌(OCSCC)由于早期症状不明显、生长部位隐蔽且生长缓慢，往往难以早期发现，导致可预防的死亡。需要开发有效的早期检测方法。

Method: 训练CNN模型识别OCSCC，使用4293张训练图像（包括良性和恶性肿瘤以及阴性样本），设计物理硬件系统采集和处理详细图像，测试不同分辨率图像对预测准确性的影响。

Result: 图像分辨率增加导致预测准确性按对数尺度提高，但更高像素数带来的收益递减。开发的增强硬件能够捕获详细图像，并开发了应用程序来促进测试过程。

Conclusion: CNN结合图像采集硬件系统可以有效检测OCSCC，图像分辨率对检测准确性有重要影响，但存在收益递减现象。

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Conclusion: 该方法为传统物体级重建方法提供了灵活渐进式的替代方案，能够有效利用第一人称视角直播中的人-物交互线索。

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic
and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world
scenarios with promising advantages.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的视频异常检测方法虽然具有优越的零样本检测能力，但计算成本巨大且视觉定位性能不稳定，阻碍了实时部署。

Method: 采用两级级联系统：离线学习正常行为规则，在线推理时结合轻量级过滤和细粒度VLM推理。关键创新包括运动掩码提示和基于规则的偏差检测。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估显示，Cerberus在NVIDIA L40S GPU上平均达到57.68 fps，速度提升151.79倍，准确率达到97.2%，与最先进的VLM-based VAD方法相当。

Conclusion: Cerberus为实时视频分析提供了一个实用的解决方案，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了检测速度。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time

Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击评估存在偏差，高攻击成功率往往源于数据集构建中的分布偏差，而非真正识别成员状态，需要构建无偏基准来准确评估攻击效果。

Method: 引入包含6000张图像的受控基准，其中成员和非成员样本分布经过仔细平衡，并在三个不同训练阶段提供真实成员标签。

Result: 在无偏条件下，最先进的成员推理攻击方法性能收敛到随机猜测水平，表明先前的高成功率主要源于分布偏差。

Conclusion: OpenLVLM-MIA为LVLM成员推理攻击研究提供了透明无偏的基准，揭示了当前方法的局限性，并为开发更强的隐私保护技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are
carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across
three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated
that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance
under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark,
OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and
provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving
techniques.

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,
while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we
propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

Method: 构建了ScaleDF数据集（包含580万张真实图像和880万张伪造图像），系统分析模型性能与真实域数量、伪造方法数量和训练图像数量的关系。

Result: 观察到检测误差随真实域数量和伪造方法数量增加呈幂律衰减，可预测达到目标性能所需的额外数据量。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测存在类似LLM的缩放规律，这为对抗不断进化的深度伪造技术提供了数据中心的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

### [28] [Scale-DiT: Ultra-High-Resolution Image Generation with Hierarchical Local Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16325)
*Yuyao Zhang,Yu-Wing Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scale-DiT是一个新的扩散框架，通过分层局部注意力和低分辨率全局引导，实现了超高清图像的高效生成，支持4K分辨率而无需额外高分辨率训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型受限于注意力机制的二次复杂性和4K训练数据稀缺，无法生成超高清图像。需要一种能同时保证细粒度纹理合成和全局结构一致性的方法。

Method: 将高分辨率潜在空间划分为固定大小的局部窗口来降低注意力复杂度；使用低分辨率潜在空间注入全局语义；通过轻量级LoRA适配连接全局和局部路径；采用Hilbert曲线重排token序列和融合内核优化推理效率。

Result: 相比密集注意力基线，推理速度提升2倍以上且内存使用更低；在4K×4K分辨率下保持稳定；在FID、IS、CLIP Score等定量指标和定性比较中表现优异，全局一致性和局部细节都更好。

Conclusion: 分层局部注意力结合引导低分辨率锚点是推进超高清图像生成的有效方法，无需额外高分辨率训练数据即可实现高质量4K图像生成。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained
texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models
remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

Motivation: 扩散模型生成过程计算密集，用户需要多次迭代优化提示词，增加了延迟和云资源负担。

Method: 提出云边协作框架，设备端使用轻量扩散模型快速生成预览，云端使用高容量模型进行最终优化，并引入噪声水平预测器动态平衡计算负载。

Result: 相比Stable Diffusion v1.5减少平均生成时间15.8%，图像质量相当；比Tiny-SD仅慢0.9%但图像质量显著提升。

Conclusion: DiffusionX在最小开销下展示了效率和可扩展性，有效解决了多轮提示词生成的计算负担问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: TokenAR框架显著增强了基于AR的条件图像生成能力，能够同时保持高质量背景重建和身份一致性

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in
multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first
open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation
dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference
subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for
multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive
experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art
models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and
datasets will be made publicly. Codes are available, see

*Junha Song,Sangdoo Yun,Dongyoon Han,Jaegul Choo,Byeongho Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了多模态语言模型性能主要继承自LLM骨干的假设，发现训练策略（特别是强化学习）会重塑视觉编码器的视觉表示，提出了PIVOT方法来高效构建强大的MLLM视觉编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM研究过度关注LLM骨干而忽视视觉编码器的作用，特别是在训练范式从监督微调转向强化学习后，缺乏对视觉编码器如何被重塑的分析。

Method: 通过多种深度实验分析视觉编码器，包括ImageNet分类、分割和梯度可视化，比较SFT和RL训练策略的影响，并提出了PIVOT优化方法。

Result: RL相比SFT能产生更强且更精确定位的视觉表示，PIVOT训练的视觉编码器性能优于更大规模的传统预训练模型，计算成本不到1%。

Conclusion: 训练策略不仅影响MLLM下游任务表现，还从根本上重塑视觉表示，PIVOT为MLLM视觉骨干的发展提供了高效路径。

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

Motivation: 社会制造通过社区协作和分散资源实现大规模个性化，但带来了质量控制特别是缺陷检测的重大挑战，主要困难包括：产品高度定制化配置、生产涉及碎片化小批量订单、分布式站点成像环境差异大。

Method: 引入MIRAD数据集，捕捉该领域的三个关键维度：具有大类内变异的多样化个性化产品、来自六个地理分散制造节点的数据、以及包括光照、背景和运动条件变化的显著成像异质性。在MIRAD上对SOTA异常检测方法进行广泛评估，涵盖单类、多类和零样本方法。

Conclusion: 通过弥合工业需求和学术研究，MIRAD为开发对工业5.0至关重要的稳健质量控制解决方案提供了现实基础。数据集已在https://github.com/wu33learn/MIRAD公开。

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR.
The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking
experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in
vision and graphics and has showed broad utility in 3D reconstruction,
generation, understanding, and simulation. While powerful models exist for
humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are
lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that
encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,
articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike
previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant
modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean
farm as a testbed. Experiments show that Demeter effectively synthesizes
shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes. Code and

Conclusion: 该方法在保持与最先进方法相当精度的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于边缘设备上的实时手部姿态估计任务。

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep
learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices
require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on
FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,
replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and
versatility. Project page: https://ChangyueShi.github.io/REALM.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉中心任务中过度依赖语言先验，在推理过程中使用文本捷径，缺乏可扩展可靠的奖励机制阻碍了强化学习的应用。

Method: 将自监督学习目标（如图像旋转预测、掩码补丁重建）转化为密集的自动奖励信号，无需人工偏好数据或不可靠的AI评估器。

Conclusion: SSL4RL建立了一个通用有效的范式，使用可验证的自监督目标来对齐多模态模型。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating
large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

TL;DR: LightGlueStick是一个轻量级的点和线段匹配器，通过注意力线消息传递机制显式暴露线的连通性，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将点和线匹配视为独立任务，GlueStick虽然联合匹配但架构沉重无法实时应用。需要设计轻量级的同时处理点和线的匹配器。

Method: 提出注意力线消息传递机制，显式暴露线的连通性，允许节点间高效通信，构建轻量级架构。

Result: 在多个基准测试中建立了新的最先进性能，代码已开源。

Conclusion: LightGlueStick通过创新的注意力线消息传递机制实现了轻量级且高效的点和线联合匹配，适合实时应用和边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in
our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which
explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for
efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that
LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.

### [41] [EDVD-LLaMA: Explainable Deepfake Video Detection via Multimodal Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16442)
*Haoran Sun,Chen Cai,Huiping Zhuang,Kong Aik Lee,Lap-Pui Chau,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了可解释深度伪造视频检测任务EDVD和EDVD-LLaMA多模态大语言模型推理框架，通过时空细粒度信息标记化和细粒度多模态思维链机制，在准确检测的同时提供可追溯的推理过程和可信解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造视频检测方法存在原理不透明、泛化能力不足的问题，迫切需要能够识别伪造内容并提供可验证推理解释的检测器。

Method: 1. 时空细粒度信息标记化(ST-SIT)提取融合全局和局部跨帧深度伪造特征；2. 细粒度多模态思维链(Fg-MCoT)机制引入面部特征数据作为硬约束，实现像素级时空视频定位；3. 构建可解释推理FF++基准数据集(ER-FF++set)支持推理和检测的双重监督。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度伪造检测领域提供了首个可解释的解决方案，通过多模态大语言模型推理框架实现了准确检测与可信解释的结合，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: RAVAR任务旨在通过自然语言描述识别特定人物的细粒度原子级动作。本文扩展了RefAVA数据集为RefAVA++，并提出RefAtomNet++框架，通过多层级语义对齐交叉注意力和多轨迹Mamba建模，在跨模态token聚合方面取得突破，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动作识别方法在复杂多人场景中难以精确地基于语言描述识别特定人物的细粒度原子级动作，跨模态信息对齐和检索能力有限，导致目标人物定位和细粒度动作预测性能不佳。

Method: 提出RefAtomNet++框架，包含多层级语义对齐交叉注意力机制（部分关键词、场景属性、整体句子层级）和多轨迹Mamba建模。在部分关键词和场景属性层级，通过动态选择最近视觉空间token构建扫描轨迹。

Result: RefAtomNet++在RefAVA++数据集上建立了新的最先进结果，超越了包括RefAtomNet在内的多个基线模型。

Conclusion: RefAtomNet++通过先进的跨模态token聚合机制，显著提升了语言引导的原子级视频动作识别性能，特别是在复杂多人场景中的目标人物定位和细粒度动作理解方面。

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are
released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的损失函数，利用高斯边界框表示和Bhattacharyya距离来增强旋转物体检测的准确性和鲁棒性，解决了传统检测方法在旋转物体上的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉应用中，如航空影像、遥感和自动驾驶，准确检测旋转物体是一个重要挑战。传统物体检测框架对轴对齐物体有效，但在处理旋转物体时由于无法有效捕捉方向变化而表现不佳。

Method: 使用高斯边界框表示和Bhattacharyya距离构建旋转不变损失函数，采用各向异性高斯表示解决类方形物体的各向同性方差问题，并将该损失函数集成到最先进的深度学习旋转物体检测器中。

Result: 大量实验表明，与现有方法相比，在平均精度指标上取得了显著改进，有望为旋转物体检测建立新的基准。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的损失函数设计，能够有效捕捉旋转物体的几何特性，为需要精确可靠物体定位的应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average
Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object
detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise
and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

TL;DR: VIPAMIN是一种视觉提示初始化策略，通过将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐，并注入超越预训练子空间的新表示方向，来增强自监督模型的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模基础模型时代，完全微调预训练网络对每个下游任务来说资源消耗巨大。现有的视觉提示调优方法在应用于自监督骨干网络时，往往无法专门化提示或丰富表示空间，特别是在具有挑战性的任务和数据稀缺设置中。

Method: VIPAMIN通过两个关键步骤增强自监督模型的适应：(1) 将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐；(2) 注入超越预训练子空间的新表示方向。该方法仅需单次前向传播和轻量级操作。

Result: VIPAMIN在不同任务和数据集大小上持续提升性能，在视觉提示调优领域达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIPAMIN提供了一种简单而有效的视觉提示初始化策略，能够显著增强自监督模型在下游任务中的适应能力，特别是在挑战性任务和数据稀缺场景下。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督域自适应方法，利用稀疏点标注来提升电子显微镜图像中线粒体分割的性能，通过多任务学习和实例感知伪标签选择策略显著缩小与全监督方法的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜图像中线粒体分割需要大量标注，而无监督域自适应方法在实际应用中性能较低。为了在减少标注成本的同时提升性能，研究利用稀疏点标注的弱监督域自适应方法。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架，联合进行分割和中心检测，引入交叉教学机制和类聚焦跨域对比学习。提出实例感知伪标签选择策略，语义地选择可靠且多样化的伪标签。

Result: 在多个挑战性数据集上的验证表明，该方法优于现有的无监督和弱监督域自适应方法，显著缩小了与全监督方法的性能差距。在无监督设置下也大幅优于其他无监督域自适应技术。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督域自适应方法能够有效利用稀疏点标注，通过多任务学习和智能伪标签选择策略，在减少标注成本的同时获得接近全监督方法的性能。

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法主要基于历史信息做决策，忽略了行动的未来影响和长期结果，需要开发具有前瞻性的智能体。

Method: 使用Q学习训练Q模型生成描述行动潜在未来信息的Q特征，通过跨模态未来编码器将任务无关的Q特征与导航指令结合，产生反映未来前景的行动分数，结合历史分数实现A*式搜索。

Result: 在广泛使用的目标导向VLN数据集上的大量实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的前瞻性导航方法通过整合未来信息显著提升了目标导向视觉语言导航的性能。

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: HGC-Avatar是一个用于动态3D虚拟人高效传输和高质量渲染的分层高斯压缩框架，通过结构层和运动层的解耦设计，在低码率下实现高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯泼溅的压缩方法缺乏人体先验知识，导致解码端的码率效率和重建质量不理想，阻碍了可流式传输的3D虚拟人系统应用。

Method: 将高斯表示解耦为结构层（通过StyleUNet生成器将姿态映射到高斯）和运动层（利用SMPL-X模型紧凑表示时序姿态变化），支持分层压缩、渐进解码和可控渲染。

Result: 实验结果表明HGC-Avatar为快速3D虚拟人渲染提供了可流式传输的解决方案，在视觉质量和压缩效率方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HGC-Avatar通过分层设计和面部注意力机制，成功解决了动态虚拟人传输中的码率效率和质量问题，为沉浸式通信提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,
the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by
the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and
expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar
rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual
quality and compression efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准要么隔离单一模态，要么依赖合成错误，无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性。需要评估大语言模型能否可靠理解和推理科学论文的多模态复杂性。

Method: 通过多阶段流程（审稿挖掘、LLM辅助过滤和人工验证）构建基准，包含三个任务：不一致识别、纠正和配对匹配，并使用结构化JSON答案表示减少语言偏见。

Result: 评估21个领先LMMs，结果显示性能极低（26.1-54.2%），包括大型开源模型和专有模型都表现不佳。

Conclusion: 多模态科学推理具有挑战性，需要开发更可靠的科学助手，当前模型在检测和解决跨模态不一致方面能力有限。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and
reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in
detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and
equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately
undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook
this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors
that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench
(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first
benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific
papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering
and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on
this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy
and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and
reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to
address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice
evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding
the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations
that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic
cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models
(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5
with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),
underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating
progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

Result: 提出的方法在mAP指标上超越现有最佳方法1.8%。消融研究显示辅助学习提升mAP 3.7%，深度归一化提升4.2%。

Conclusion: OOS-DSD通过多任务辅助学习有效提升了缺货检测性能，深度估计和产品分割的辅助任务对主要任务有显著帮助。

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

Motivation: 开发一种代表性中心的图像分类和检索方法，利用图结构捕捉图像间的相似关系，并通过注意力机制突出重要特征。

Conclusion: 基于GAT自编码器的代表性中心方法在图像分类和检索任务中表现出良好的效果。

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages
graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is
representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: READ是一种微调方法，通过添加token级重构和句子级对齐两个辅助目标来增强视觉语言模型的组合推理能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，主要原因是文本编码器倾向于关注单个单词而非它们之间的关系，对比训练主要将单词与视觉对象对齐，这强化了这种局限性。

Method: READ方法在对比学习基础上添加两个辅助目标：(1) token级重构目标：使用冻结的预训练解码器基于原始标题的嵌入重构替代标题；(2) 句子级对齐目标：在嵌入空间中显式对齐释义句子。

Result: READ-CLIP在五个主要组合推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，比最强的传统微调基线高出最多4.1%。将READ应用于现有CLIP变体也能提升这些基准测试的性能。

Conclusion: 重构和对齐目标提供互补优势：前者鼓励编码器捕捉标题内单词间的关系，后者确保不同措辞表达的释义具有一致表示。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

Motivation: 现有步态识别方法使用预定义区域和固定时间尺度，难以建模随时间动态变化的运动区域和适应其特定模式。

Method: 提出区域感知动态聚合与激励框架(GaitRDAE)，包含RDA模块动态搜索每个区域的最佳时间感受野，RDE模块强调稳定行为模式运动区域的学习。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GaitRDAE通过动态区域搜索和自适应时间尺度分配，有效提升了步态识别的准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions
containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static
regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that
GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

*Guangyu Lin,Li Lin,Christina P. Walker,Daniel S. Schiff,Shu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文基于真实世界政治深度伪造事件数据库，首次系统评估了学术界、政府和工业界的最先进深度伪造检测器，发现现有检测器在真实政治深度伪造内容上泛化能力不足，呼吁开发政治情境化的检测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的快速扩散增加了虚假信息风险，特别是政治深度伪造会扭曲真相并破坏对政治机构的信任。现有检测模型大多在实验室合成数据集上训练验证，难以泛化到社交媒体上传播的真实政治深度伪造内容。

Method: 基于政治深度伪造事件数据库（自2018年以来社交媒体上分享的真实政治深度伪造内容集合），对学术界、政府和工业界的最先进深度伪造检测器进行系统评估。

Result: 学术界和政府检测器表现相对较差；付费检测工具比免费模型性能稍高，但所有评估的检测器都难以有效泛化到真实政治深度伪造内容，且对简单操作（尤其是视频领域）易受攻击。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发政治情境化的深度伪造检测框架，以在真实世界环境中更好地保护公众。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in
generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large
language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media
effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political
deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher
performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to
generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to
simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for
politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard
the public in real-world settings.

*Yiyang Huang,Liang Shi,Yitian Zhang,Yi Xu,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过重新加权视觉token、引入噪声衍生token和应用对抗攻击来缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在跨模态任务中表现出色，但物体幻觉问题仍然是一个重要挑战。与之前关注LLM组件的研究不同，本文首次将LVLM幻觉追溯到视觉编码器，并识别出三个关键问题：统计偏差、固有偏差和脆弱性。

Method: 提出SHIELD框架，包含三种策略：重新加权视觉token以减少统计偏差，引入噪声衍生token来对抗固有偏差，以及应用带有对比解码的对抗攻击来解决脆弱性问题。

Result: 实验表明，SHIELD在各种基准测试和LVLM家族中有效缓解了物体幻觉问题。此外，SHIELD在通用LVLM基准测试中表现出色，显示了其广泛的适用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个有效的训练免费框架，能够显著减轻大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题，具有广泛的适用性和良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be
released.

### [55] [VisionSelector: End-to-End Learnable Visual Token Compression for Efficient Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16598)
*Jiaying Zhu,Yurui Zhu,Xin Lu,Wenrui Yan,Dong Li,Kunlin Liu,Xueyang Fu,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionSelector是一个轻量级的即插即用框架，通过可学习的决策过程解决多模态大语言模型中视觉令牌压缩的问题，采用可微分Top-K机制和课程退火策略，在各种压缩率下实现高效自适应令牌选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理高分辨率图像或多图像输入时面临大量视觉令牌带来的计算和内存瓶颈，现有令牌压缩技术受限于启发式规则，存在丢弃关键信息和注意力偏差的风险。

Method: 提出VisionSelector评分器模块，与MLLM主干解耦，包含可微分Top-K机制和课程退火策略，形成端到端可学习的令牌压缩决策过程。

Result: 仅需12.85M可训练参数，在MME基准上以30%保留预算保持100%准确率，在10%保留预算下比先前方法提升12.14%，预填充速度提升一倍。

Conclusion: VisionSelector在各种压缩预算下均表现出色，能够自适应识别关键令牌，实现高效令牌压缩。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational
and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by
high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is
available at https://github.com/JulietChoo/VisionSelector .

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however,
interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and
susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing
techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for
real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a
deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to
enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple
imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system
integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet,
and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including
model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables
flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures,
ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR.
Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%,
segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80
milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and
segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These
results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate
diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI
integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

*Sebastian Mocanu,Emil Slusanschi,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于视觉的小型无人机室内自主飞行系统，结合语义分割和单目深度估计实现避障、场景探索和自主安全着陆，无需GPS或昂贵传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型无人机在受控室内环境中自主飞行的挑战，避免依赖GPS或昂贵传感器如LiDAR，通过纯视觉方法实现可靠导航。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏框架，SVM教师生成训练数据，轻量级U-Net学生网络进行实时语义分割；创新自适应尺度因子算法将非度量深度预测转换为准确度量距离。

Result: 在5x4米实验室环境中测试，平均距离误差14.4厘米；30次真实环境飞行测试和100次数字孪生环境测试显示，组合方法增加监视距离、减少任务时间，保持100%成功率。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了结构化环境中基于视觉的无人机导航实践，解决了度量深度估计和计算效率挑战，可在资源受限平台上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing
method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances
practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,
demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational
efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

### [58] [MultiVerse: A Multi-Turn Conversation Benchmark for Evaluating Large Vision and Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16641)
*Young-Jun Lee,Byung-Kwan Lee,Jianshu Zhang,Yechan Hwang,Byungsoo Ko,Han-Gyu Kim,Dongyu Yao,Xuankun Rong,Eojin Joo,Seung-Ho Han,Bowon Ko,Ho-Jin Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiVerse是一个新颖的多轮对话基准测试，包含647个对话，涵盖12个流行VLM评估基准的484个任务，用于评估视觉语言模型在多轮对话中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮对话数据集仅部分覆盖真实场景的广度和深度，需要更全面的基准来评估VLM在多轮对话中的能力。

Method: 从12个流行VLM评估基准中提取647个对话，提出基于检查表的评估方法，使用GPT-4o作为自动评估器，测量37个关键方面的性能。

Result: 评估了18个VLM，即使最强模型（如GPT-4o）在复杂多轮对话中也仅达到50%成功率，提供完整对话上下文能显著提升较弱模型的性能。

Conclusion: MultiVerse是评估VLM多轮交互能力的全面基准，揭示了当前模型在多轮对话中的局限性，强调了上下文学习的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on
single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate
multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only
partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered
by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn
conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns -
derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484
tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from
factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a
checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated
evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual
accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on
MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve
only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the
dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue
context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

*Aaron Ray,Jacob Arkin,Harel Biggie,Chuchu Fan,Luca Carlone,Nicholas Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用检索增强生成方法，通过Cypher查询语言作为LLM工具来检索3D场景图中的相关数据，解决大语言模型与3D场景图结合时的扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将场景图序列化为文本放入LLM上下文窗口，但这种方法无法扩展到大型或丰富的3D场景图。需要一种更高效的连接自然语言与机器人世界表示的方法。

Method: 使用检索增强生成方法，将3D场景图编码到图数据库中，为LLM提供Cypher查询语言作为工具接口，使其能够检索与任务相关的数据。

Result: 在指令跟随和场景问答任务上的评估表明，使用Cypher作为3D场景图接口的方法在本地和云端模型上都能显著扩展到大型丰富图，性能大幅提升，同时大幅减少场景图内容的token数量。

Conclusion: Cypher查询语言作为3D场景图的接口，在语言接地任务中具有更好的可扩展性和性能表现。

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

### [60] [Universal and Transferable Attacks on Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16660)
*Yuntian Wang,Xilin Yang,Che-Yung Shen,Nir Pillar,Aydogan Ozcan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对病理学基础模型的通用可迁移对抗扰动(UTAP)，这是一种固定且微弱的噪声模式，能够系统性地破坏多个病理学基础模型的特征表示能力，导致下游任务性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示病理学基础模型的关键脆弱性，为模型鲁棒性评估建立高标准基准，推动防御机制发展，确保AI在病理学中的安全可靠部署。

Method: 使用深度学习优化生成固定且微弱的对抗扰动噪声模式，该扰动可应用于不同视野的图像，并能迁移到未见过的黑盒病理学基础模型。

Result: UTAP在多个最先进的病理学基础模型和数据集上进行了系统评估，通过视觉不可察觉的固定噪声模式显著降低了模型性能，证明了其普遍性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: UTAP构成了对各种新兴病理学基础模型及其应用的广泛威胁，强调了推进防御机制的必要性，并为对抗训练提供了必要资源。

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

TL;DR: 提出HYDRA方法，通过教师-学生模型和知识蒸馏实现高质量光谱重建，在各项指标上达到SOTA性能，准确率提升18%，推理速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多尺度注意力方法只能处理稀疏光谱，而现代高光谱传感器包含数百个通道，需要更通用的光谱重建方法。

Method: 使用教师模型封装潜在高光谱数据，学生模型学习从自然图像到教师编码域的映射，结合新颖的训练方法实现知识蒸馏。

Result: 在所有指标上达到SOTA性能，准确率提升18%，在不同通道深度下推理速度均优于当前SOTA模型。

Conclusion: HYDRA方法成功解决了先前光谱重建模型的关键限制，实现了高质量的光谱重建。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

TL;DR: MSSR是一个双智能体框架，通过构建最小充分信息集来解决视觉语言模型在3D空间推理中的挑战，显著提升了准确性并实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在3D空间推理中的两个基本瓶颈：基于2D预训练导致的3D理解能力不足，以及冗余3D信息引发的推理失败。

Method: 提出双智能体框架：感知智能体使用感知工具箱程序化查询3D场景提取充分信息（包括新颖的SOG模块），推理智能体迭代精炼信息以追求最小化，在闭环中剪枝冗余细节并请求缺失信息，直到构建出最小充分集。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试中，该方法通过明确追求充分性和最小化，显著提高了准确性并实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了性能，还产生了可解释的推理路径，为未来模型提供了高质量的训练数据来源。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT图像分析在眼科疾病诊断中至关重要，但获取配对的干净和噪声OCT图像数据集存在困难，因为固有的散斑噪声和临床成像环境限制

Method: 使用自融合和自监督去噪生成伪真实图像，然后采用基于patch的策略训练去噪模型集成，有效增强图像清晰度

Result: 在IEEE SPS VIP Cup真实世界数据集上验证，通过CNR、MSR、TP和EP等指标显示性能提升，该数据集仅包含真实噪声OCT图像而无干净参考

Conclusion: 该方法在临床实践中具有改善图像质量和诊断结果的潜力，特别适用于缺乏干净参考图像的真实世界场景

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的域连接对比学习（DCCL）方法来解决领域泛化问题，通过增强跨域的概念连通性来获得可泛化的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练和测试样本之间的分布偏移会阻碍模型泛化性能。虽然对比学习（CL）的类分离表示理论上应该改善领域泛化（DG），但实际应用CL反而会降低性能，原因是DG设置中缺乏类内连通性。

Method: 提出DCCL方法：在数据层面，使用更激进的数据增强和跨域正样本来提高类内连通性；在模型层面，提出模型锚定来利用预训练表示中的类内连通性，并通过生成变换损失进行补充。

Result: 在五个标准DG基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DCCL即使在没有域监督的情况下也优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DCCL通过增强跨域的概念连通性，成功解决了对比学习在领域泛化中的性能下降问题，获得了可泛化的表示。

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code
are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型需要多步去噪过程，推理效率较低。本文旨在开发一个高效的单步生成框架，在保持预测准确性的同时大幅提升推理速度。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的时空架构，结合时间嵌入来建模长程依赖关系并保持运动连贯性，学习噪声运动状态与干净运动状态之间的自一致映射。

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上的实验表明，HumanCM在保持与最先进扩散模型相当或更优准确性的同时，将推理步骤减少了两个数量级。

Conclusion: HumanCM证明了通过一致性模型实现高效单步人类运动预测的可行性，为实时应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon
consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in
diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by
learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The
framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal
embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence.
Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves
comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while
reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to
achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of
the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper
bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

TL;DR: IR-WM是一个隐式残差世界模型，专注于建模当前状态和世界演化，通过BEV表示和残差预测来避免冗余重建静态背景，在nuScenes基准测试中在4D占用预测和轨迹规划方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端自动驾驶系统依赖视觉中心世界模型，但这些模型通常完全重建未来场景，浪费了大量容量在冗余建模静态背景上。

Method: IR-WM首先从视觉观测建立鲁棒的鸟瞰图表示当前状态，然后利用前一时刻的BEV特征作为强时间先验，仅预测基于自车动作和场景上下文的"残差"变化。还应用对齐模块来校准语义和动态错位，并研究不同的预测-规划耦合方案。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，IR-WM在4D占用预测和轨迹规划方面实现了顶级性能。

Conclusion: 通过隐式残差建模和避免冗余背景重建，IR-WM显著提高了世界模型的效率和规划准确性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

*Tianyang Dou,Ming Li,Jiangying Qin,Xuan Liao,Jiageng Zhong,Armin Gruen,Mengyi Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UKANFormer是一种新颖的语义分割模型，旨在在来自Allen Coral Atlas的噪声监督下实现高精度珊瑚礁映射，通过架构设计缓解标签噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球珊瑚礁产品如Allen Coral Atlas在空间精度和语义一致性方面存在限制，特别是在需要精细边界划分的区域，因此需要开发能够处理噪声监督的高精度映射方法。

Method: 基于UKAN架构，UKANFormer在解码器中加入了全局-局部变换器（GL-Trans）模块，能够同时提取全局语义结构和局部边界细节。

Result: UKANFormer在珊瑚类IoU上达到67.00%，像素精度达到83.98%，在相同噪声标签设置下优于传统基线方法，产生的预测在视觉和结构上都比训练用的噪声标签更准确。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了数据质量直接限制模型性能的观念，表明架构设计可以缓解标签噪声，支持在非完美监督下进行可扩展映射，为生态监测提供了可靠标签稀缺情况下的解决方案。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions
reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that
capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to
support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a
unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize
the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy
encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2)
Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference
Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature
Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We
systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and
general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level
understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative
comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges,
including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics
that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between
model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time
control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal
consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，离散的自回归视觉模型比连续扩散模型更适合推理时搜索优化，光束搜索能显著提升文本到图像生成质量，2B参数的自回归模型可超越12B扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然推理时搜索在大型语言模型中取得了革命性进展，但在图像生成领域应用搜索策略效果有限，简单随机采样往往表现最佳。本文旨在探索如何将搜索策略有效应用于视觉生成。

Method: 采用离散的视觉自回归模型，利用光束搜索进行推理时优化，通过早期剪枝和计算重用来提升效率。

Result: 光束搜索显著改善了文本到图像生成，2B参数的自回归模型在多个基准测试中超越了12B参数的扩散模型。验证器分析揭示了速度与推理能力之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 模型架构（而不仅仅是规模）对于视觉生成中的推理时优化至关重要，离散自回归模型为搜索策略提供了更有效的平台。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language
Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult.
Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含1302个SR伪影示例的数据集，每个伪影都有众包显著性评分，并训练了一个轻量级回归器来生成空间显著性热图，优于现有方法检测显著伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SR模型容量的扩大，它们倾向于产生伪影，这些伪影的感知影响各不相同，有些几乎不可察觉，有些则严重降低图像质量。伪影应该根据其对人类观察者的显著性来表征，而不是作为统一的二元缺陷处理。

Method: 构建了一个包含1302个来自11种当代图像SR方法的伪影示例的数据集，每个伪影都配有众包显著性评分。基于该数据集，训练了一个轻量级回归器来生成空间显著性热图。

Result: 训练的回归器在检测显著伪影方面优于现有方法，能够生成空间显著性热图。

Conclusion: 释放数据集和代码以促进基于显著性的SR伪影评估和缓解。

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality
and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does
their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Motivation: 传统CNN方法在图像恢复中受限于小感受野和缺乏通道特征建模，难以充分恢复精细纹理细节。

Method: 使用全局多尺度小波变换卷积(GMWTConvs)扩大感受野；设计Mamba通道感知模块(MCAM)捕获通道间长程依赖；提出多尺度纹理增强损失(MTELoss)指导纹理结构保持。

Result: 实验证明WaMaIR在图像恢复任务中优于现有方法，实现了更好的恢复效果和计算效率。

Conclusion: WaMaIR通过扩大感受野和增强通道建模能力，有效解决了图像恢复中的纹理细节重建问题，取得了state-of-the-art性能。

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,
where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency.
However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately
restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field
of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we
propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像区域孤立处理，仅依赖局部线索，导致编辑不一致、过渡不自然或图像连贯性丧失

Method: 引入双级引导机制：区域在完整图像上下文中表示并与详细区域级描述对齐，同时整个图像与视觉语言模型生成的场景级描述匹配

Result: 实验表明该方法能产生更连贯且与指令对齐的结果

Conclusion: 该方法通过让每个区域理解其在全局图像上下文中的角色，实现了精确协调的图像编辑

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学报告生成模型主要依赖大语言模型，对预训练视觉基础模型和先进微调技术探索有限，且忽视了非Transformer架构如Mamba网络的潜力。

Method: 将X射线图像分块标记化，使用SSM基础的视觉骨干网络提取特征，采用Partial LoRA进行参数高效微调，结合混合解码器的LLM生成报告。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验验证了所提策略的有效性，实现了端到端训练并获得强劲结果。

Conclusion: EMRRG框架展示了Mamba网络在医学报告生成中的潜力，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in
artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for
clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on
Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited
exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature
extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a
hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and
achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three
widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be

Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法通常基于2D-3D特征对应关系，但在纹理缺失物体和光照变化条件下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出GS2POSE方法，基于捆绑调整原理和Lie代数，构建姿态可微的渲染管道，通过比较输入图像与渲染图像迭代优化姿态参数，同时更新3DGS模型的颜色参数以适应光照变化。

Result: 在T-LESS、LineMod-Occlusion和LineMod数据集上分别实现了1.4%、2.8%和2.5%的精度提升。

Conclusion: GS2POSE通过结合3D高斯散射和捆绑调整原理，有效解决了纹理缺失和光照变化条件下的6D姿态估计问题，在多个数据集上取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing
correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these
methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying
illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a
novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and
LineMod datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 现有视频理解模型依赖大量标注数据进行任务特定训练，成本高且可扩展性有限。大型视觉语言模型在静态图像上的零样本推理能力尚未充分应用于视频领域。

Method: 使用预训练VLM的冻结视觉编码器将视频流转换为语义特征轨迹，采用核时间分割(KTS)将连续特征流划分为离散的语义连贯事件段，然后通过无监督密度聚类识别重复出现的宏观场景和主题。

Conclusion: 该方法为零样本、自动化的视频内容结构分析提供了一条有效、可解释且模型无关的途径。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要微调模型以产生与掩码解码器兼容的特定输出，这会改变模型的输出空间并损害其内在泛化能力，违背了构建统一模型的目标。

Method: LENS在完全冻结的MLLM上附加轻量级可训练头部，通过精炼注意力图中嵌入的空间线索来提取关键点，并将其描述为与掩码解码器直接兼容的点状特征。

Result: LENS实现了与基于重新训练方法相当或更优的分割性能，同时完全保留了MLLM的泛化能力，而微调方法会显著降低这种能力。

Conclusion: LENS的可附加设计为扩展MLLM建立了高效强大的范式，为构建真正多才多艺的统一模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

Motivation: 消除对昂贵人工标注数据集的依赖，为自动驾驶提供可扩展的无监督道路分割解决方案。

Method: 首先基于几何先验生成弱标签（地平线以上为非道路，车辆前方四边形区域为道路），然后通过跨帧跟踪局部特征点并利用互信息最大化来强制时间一致性。

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上实现了0.82的交并比(IoU)，表现出高精度和简单设计。

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和时间一致性的方法在自动驾驶无监督道路分割中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 摄影风格作为特定摄影概念的组合，是著名摄影师魅力的来源。但学习和转移摄影风格需要深刻理解照片从未知原始外观如何编辑而来。现有方法要么无法从参考图像中学习有意义的摄影概念，要么无法保留内容图像的内容。

Method: 基于预训练文本到图像扩散模型，利用生成先验学习摄影概念的平均外观以及如何根据文本提示调整它们。通过文本反转技术优化摄影概念的提示来学习参考图像的摄影风格。

Conclusion: PIF能够有效解决摄影风格学习和转移的问题，展示了在多种摄影风格提取和转移方面的卓越性能。

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the
charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic
style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown
original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful
photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of
the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image
Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

Abstract: Lychee is a high-value subtropical fruit. The adoption of vision-based
harvesting robots can significantly improve productivity while reduce reliance
on labor. High-quality data are essential for developing such harvesting
robots. However, there are currently no consistently and comprehensively
annotated open-source lychee datasets featuring fruits in natural growing
environments. To address this, we constructed a dataset to facilitate lychee
detection and maturity classification. Color (RGB) images were acquired under
diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple
lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset
encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images,
consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth
images. The images are annotated with 9,658 pairs of lables for lychee
detection and maturity classification. To improve annotation consistency, three
individuals independently labeled the data, and their results were then
aggregated and verified by a fourth reviewer. Detailed statistical analyses
were done to examine the dataset. Finally, we performed experiments using three
representative deep learning models to evaluate the dataset. It is publicly
available for academic

TL;DR: ReefNet是一个大型公开珊瑚礁图像数据集，包含约92.5万个属级硬珊瑚标注，映射到世界海洋物种名录，旨在推动自动化珊瑚礁监测和领域泛化研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于气候变化等人为压力导致珊瑚礁快速衰退，急需可扩展的自动化监测方法。现有数据集在规模、地理范围或标注粒度方面存在局限，且不适用于机器学习。

Method: 整合了76个CoralNet来源和红海Al Wajh站点的图像，提供细粒度、分类学映射的标注。提出两种评估设置：源内基准测试和跨源基准测试，分析监督学习和零样本分类性能。

Result: 监督学习在源内表现良好，但跨域性能显著下降；零样本模型整体表现较差，特别是对于稀有和视觉相似属。

Conclusion: ReefNet为领域泛化和细粒度珊瑚分类提供了一个具有挑战性的基准，旨在推动鲁棒、领域自适应的全球珊瑚礁监测和保护。

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as
climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated
monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with
point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and
conservation.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，利用纹理特征预测木屑水分含量，解决不同来源木屑数据分布变化问题，准确率达80%，比非适应模型提高23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接方法（烘箱干燥）处理时间长且破坏样本，间接方法在木屑来源多样时准确性不足。需要一种能有效应对来源变异性的鲁棒方法。

Method: 分析五种纹理特征，提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，使用纹理特征将知识从一个木屑数据源转移到另一个源，并基于调整互信息提出模型保存标准。

Result: 组合五种纹理特征达到95%准确率。AdaptMoist方法跨域预测准确率平均80%，比非适应模型（57%）提高23%。

Conclusion: AdaptMoist是跨域木屑水分含量估计的有效鲁棒解决方案，对依赖木屑的行业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2DGS-R是一种改进2D高斯泼溅的方法，通过分层训练策略在保持几何精度的同时提升渲染质量，仅需1%额外存储和少量训练时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)渲染质量高但难以准确表示表面，2DGS几何保真度好但渲染质量受损，目前无法在单阶段训练中同时优化几何和渲染质量。

Method: 采用分层训练：先用法向一致性正则化训练原始2D高斯，然后选择渲染质量不足的2D高斯进行原地克隆操作增强，最后冻结不透明度微调模型。

Result: 相比原始2DGS，仅需1%额外存储和最小额外训练时间，实现了高质量渲染结果同时保持精细几何结构。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了效率与性能，在视觉保真度和几何重建精度方面均有提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

Conclusion: ArmFormer是部署在便携安全摄像头、监控无人机和嵌入式AI加速器等分布式安全基础设施中的最优解决方案。

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in
distributed security infrastructure.

*Shujian Gao,Yuan Wang,Zekuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BARL是一个半监督医学图像分割框架，通过在表示空间和标签空间的双边对齐，显著提升分割性能，减少标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督医学图像分割方法主要依赖标签空间一致性，但忽视了表示空间对齐的重要性，导致模型难以学习到既具有判别性又具有空间一致性的表示。

Method: 提出BARL框架，包含两个协作分支：1）标签空间对齐：通过双路径正则化和渐进认知偏差校正实现细粒度跨分支一致性；2）表示空间对齐：在分支间进行区域级和病灶实例级匹配，捕捉医学图像中常见的碎片化复杂病理模式。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集和一个私有CBCT数据集上的实验表明，BARL持续超越最先进的半监督医学图像分割方法。消融研究进一步验证了各组件的贡献。

Conclusion: BARL通过双边对齐策略有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，证明了表示空间对齐与标签空间对齐同等重要。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully
supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS
methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally
critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent
features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative
and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment
in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples
two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For
label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we
devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively
Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch
consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For
representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance
matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex
pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four
public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further
validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

Motivation: 当前基于内存库的3D异常检测方法存在特征变换不一致和判别能力有限的问题，特别是在捕捉局部几何细节和实现旋转不变性方面。当配准失败时，这些问题会导致不可靠的检测结果。

Method: 提出配准诱导的旋转不变特征提取框架，将点云配准目标与基于内存的异常检测集成。通过将特征提取嵌入到配准学习过程中，联合优化对齐和表示学习。

Result: 在Anomaly-ShapeNet和Real3D-AD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在有效性和泛化性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 点云配准在引导特征提取朝向旋转不变和局部判别表示方面起着关键作用，所提出的框架能够获得既对旋转鲁棒又对异常检测高度有效的特征。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对人工神经网络与人类大脑处理之间相似性的理解有限：单模态ANN研究无法捕捉大脑固有的多模态处理能力，而多模态ANN研究主要关注高层模型输出，忽略了单个神经元的关键作用。

Method: 结合细粒度人工神经元分析与基于fMRI的体素编码，研究两种架构不同的视觉语言模型（CLIP和METER），通过神经元级别分析框架研究多模态信息处理机制。

Result: 发现四个关键结果：ANNs能成功预测多个功能网络的生物神经元活动；ANNs和BNs都表现出功能冗余；ANNs表现出与BNs平行的极性模式；CLIP和METER的架构驱动不同的BNs活动模式。

Conclusion: 这些结果为视觉语言模型中存在类似大脑的层次处理提供了有力证据，表明在神经元级别上ANNs与人类大脑处理具有显著的相似性。

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

Conclusion: Edit-R1框架有效解决了指令图像编辑中的过拟合问题，通过策略优化和MLLM奖励模型实现了更好的泛化能力和性能提升，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured
conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their
potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work
adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while
SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive
mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and
92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image
resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic
performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness -
whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address
this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions.
We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance
trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring
performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale
evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and
task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation
models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong
zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流模型生成质量高但计算成本昂贵，现有蒸馏方法缺乏统一的理论基础

Method: 将扩散蒸馏建模为Bregman散度密度比匹配问题，提供凸分析视角统一多种现有目标

Result: 在CIFAR-10和文生图任务上，Di-Bregman相比反向KL蒸馏获得更好的一步FID，同时保持高视觉保真度

Conclusion: Bregman密度比匹配是通向高效一步扩散生成的理论基础扎实且实用的途径

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain
computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods
accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing
objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose
Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as
Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view
connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves
improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual
fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman
density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward
efficient one-step diffusion generation.

TL;DR: 提出了CARE框架，通过序列-图像对比对齐方法解决ADL识别中序列和图像表示之间的对齐问题，在三个CASAS数据集上取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ADL识别方法存在表示级限制：序列方法保持时间顺序但对噪声敏感且缺乏空间感知，图像方法捕获全局模式但压缩时间动态且扭曲传感器布局，简单融合方法无法有效对齐不同表示视图。

Method: CARE框架包含：(1)时间感知、抗噪声序列编码；(2)空间感知和频率敏感的图像表示；(3)联合对比-分类目标函数，通过序列-图像对比对齐(SICA)和交叉熵联合优化表示学习和分类。

Conclusion: CARE框架通过端到端学习对齐且可区分的嵌入，实现了可靠的ADL识别，在智能家居环境中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for
reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练、在线执行的视频步骤定位方法BaGLM，利用大型多模态模型的零样本能力，通过贝叶斯滤波整合历史帧信息，在三个数据集上超越了需要训练的最先进离线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视频步骤定位方法需要带标签的训练数据和离线处理整个视频，这成本高昂且无法满足需要在线决策的场景。本文探索如何在不训练的情况下在线执行VSG任务。

Method: 利用大型多模态模型的零样本能力预测有限帧的步骤，开发BaGLM方法，通过贝叶斯滤波原则整合历史帧信息，包括使用大型语言模型提取的依赖矩阵和步骤进度估计。

Result: 在线无训练策略优于离线和基于训练的方法。BaGLM在三个数据集上表现出色，超越了最先进的基于训练的离线方法。

Conclusion: BaGLM证明了利用大型多模态模型的零样本能力可以在不进行任务特定训练的情况下，有效实现在线视频步骤定位，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

Motivation: 当前时序视频定位研究过于集中在少数视频表示方法上，可能导致长期架构过拟合。为了解决这个问题，需要研究不同视频特征对经典架构的影响。

Method: 在Charades-STA、ActivityNet-Captions和YouCookII三个基准数据集上，使用基于CNN、时序推理和Transformer的不同视频编码器提取特征，并在经典架构上进行对比实验。

Result: 结果显示，仅改变视频编码器就能显著影响模型性能，同时揭示了使用某些特征时产生的清晰模式和错误，表明存在特征互补的潜力。

Conclusion: 不同视频特征对时序视频定位任务有显著影响，特征之间存在互补性，这为未来研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to
localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role
in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated
every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

Method: 设计了一个简单基准测试来衡量遥感模型在低分辨率图像上的泛化能力，并在MillionAID数据集上训练了iBOT自监督视觉编码器，进行了遥感特定的修改。

Result: 结果显示，在ViT-B规模下，这些预训练模型都没有比通用基线带来一致的改进。

Conclusion: 结论是在小规模情况下，专用遥感基础模型并不比通用视觉基础模型更有用，至少在当前实验规模下如此。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

Motivation: 利用多模态LLM联合处理文本和视频，解决视频时序定位中语言查询信息不足的问题，提高定位准确性。

Method: 两阶段方法：首先将语言查询转化为包含缺失细节的增强句子，然后使用轻量级解码器基于增强查询的上下文表示预测准确边界，采用多实例学习目标减少幻觉影响。

Result: 在多个视频时序定位和段落定位基准测试中达到最先进水平，显著优于所有先前基于LLM的时序定位方法，在零样本评估场景中具有明显优势。

Conclusion: ED-VTG方法通过查询增强和动态选择机制，有效提升了视频时序定位的性能，在保持与专用模型相当性能的同时，在零样本场景下表现更优。

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出W2R2训练框架，通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制来解决多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏差问题，在不改变推理架构的情况下提升3D定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态3D定位模型存在严重的"2D语义偏差"问题，过度依赖2D图像特征进行粗略定位，而忽视3D几何输入，导致融合性能不佳。

Method: W2R2框架将2D特征指定为语义信标用于"What"识别，3D特征作为空间锚点用于"Where"定位，包含双目标损失函数：对齐损失通过适应交叉熵监督融合预测，伪标签损失通过基于边界的机制惩罚过度有效的2D主导伪输出。

Result: 在ScanRefer和ScanQA数据集上的实验表明，W2R2在定位精度和鲁棒性方面取得显著提升，特别是在杂乱户外场景中。

Conclusion: W2R2通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制有效解决了2D语义偏差问题，为多模态3D定位提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是癌症死亡的主要原因，CT成像在筛查、预后和治疗中至关重要。手动分割存在变异性且耗时，而深度学习虽然提供自动化，但在临床应用中面临障碍。

Method: 使用来自12个公共数据集的999名患者的多中心CT数据，评估了5种深度学习模型（3D Attention U-Net、ResUNet、VNet、ReconNet、SAM-Med3D）。通过497个放射组学特征评估分割可重复性，比较监督学习和半监督学习的预后建模，并由6名医生进行定性评估。

Result: VNet获得最佳性能（Dice = 0.83，IoU = 0.71），放射组学稳定性（平均相关性= 0.76，ICC = 0.65）和SSL下的预测准确性（准确率= 0.88，F1 = 0.83）。SSL在所有模型中始终优于SL。放射科医生偏爱VNet的瘤周表现和平滑边界。

Conclusion: 将VNet与SSL结合可产生准确、可重复且临床可信的基于CT的肺癌预后结果，突出了实现以医生为中心的AI转化的可行路径。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI
translation.

Motivation: 虽然先进的特征提取方法和目标函数改进已显著提升行人重识别性能，但选择更好的类代表是一个研究不足的领域。现有方法主要使用类质心作为代表，但这种方法在重识别指标上表现欠佳。

Method: 提出广义选择方法，选择不限于类质心的表示作为类代表，可以调整每个类的实际表示数量以满足特定应用需求。

Conclusion: 广义选择方法能够有效提升行人重识别性能，超越了现有技术水平，为选择更好的类代表提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Conclusion: 基于熵的推理过程优化可有效提升LMM视频推理性能，无需额外训练数据或RL，具有显著效率优势。

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the
gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any
training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced
by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a
quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation
strategies for diverse downstream applications.

*Zhe Luo,Wenjing Jia,Stuart Perry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProDAT是一种基于密度感知的渐进式点云编码方法，通过单一模型实现多码率下的渐进解码，在保持编码效率的同时支持细节逐步恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云在自动驾驶、增强现实等应用中需要实时处理和低延迟，但大数据量和带宽限制阻碍了高质量服务的部署。现有学习型点云编码方法的固定潜在表示不支持渐进解码。

Method: 提出ProDAT密度感知尾丢弃机制，利用密度信息作为指导信号，根据重要性自适应解码潜在特征和坐标，实现单一模型下的多码率渐进解码。

Conclusion: ProDAT通过密度感知机制成功实现了点云的渐进式编码，在保持高编码效率的同时解决了现有方法不支持渐进解码的问题。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

Motivation: 多模态目标检测在挑战性条件下通过利用多个传感器模态的互补线索来提高鲁棒性，但现有方法往往针对特定数据集，缺乏通用性。

Method: FMCAF结合频域滤波块(Freq-Filter)来抑制冗余光谱特征，以及基于跨注意力的融合模块(MCAF)来改进模态间特征共享。

Result: 在LLVIP(低光行人检测)和VEDAI(航空车辆检测)数据集上，FMCAF优于传统融合方法，在VEDAI上mAP@50提升13.9%，在LLVIP上提升1.1%。

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce
Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing
architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs.
FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress
redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF)
to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50
on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a
flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

TL;DR: GSPlane通过引入平面先验来改进高斯泼溅的几何重建质量，特别针对平面区域提供更平滑精确的网格重建，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法在重建平面区域时存在平滑度和精度不足的问题，需要结构化表示来支持下游应用如场景编辑和物理模拟。

Method: 利用现成的分割和法向预测模型提取平面先验，建立结构化平面高斯坐标表示，引入动态高斯重分类器优化训练过程，并使用优化后的平面先验改进网格布局。

Result: 在保持渲染质量的同时，显著提高了提取网格的几何精度，减少了顶点和面数，改善了拓扑结构。

Conclusion: GSPlane通过平面先验的引入有效解决了高斯泼溅在平面重建中的几何精度问题，为结构化场景表示提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但往往以牺牲内容保真度为代价来获得更高的感知真实性，这一问题在低光场景中尤为严重。

Conclusion: 该方法为即插即用方案，可无缝集成到现有扩散网络中提供更有效的控制，在保持真实性和美学质量的同时改善保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

Motivation: 开发一种视觉不可见的水印技术，用于隐私保护和内容验证，同时利用消费相机的特性实现低帧率下的水印提取。

Method: 采用光谱调制而非强度调制，综合考虑人眼视觉系统敏感性、相机传感器光谱灵敏度和LED生成白光的特性，优化LED光谱轮廓。

Result: 能够在标准低帧率（30-60 fps）下提取水印，在10秒视频片段中嵌入128位信息，足以支持基本元数据需求。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对人眼不可见但对相机可检测的水印嵌入，为隐私保护和内容验证提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to
produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach
optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the
human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The
method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

Motivation: 现有方法通过扰动文本条件嵌入生成OOD样本，存在语义不稳定性和多样性不足的问题，限制了在真实OOD场景中的泛化能力

Method: 使用现成的ID分类器，结合图像级引导（基于对数分割梯度减少输入似然）和特征级引导（基于k-NN距离在分类器潜在空间中促进稀疏区域采样）的双重引导设计

Result: GOOD能够生成更可控和多样化的OOD样本，通过统一OOD评分自适应结合图像和特征差异，显著提升了OOD检测性能

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过双重引导机制有效解决了现有OOD样本生成方法的局限性，为OOD检测提供了更高质量的样本生成方案

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Conclusion: KineDiff3D框架有效解决了关节物体的3D重建和姿态估计问题，通过运动学感知的扩散模型实现了准确的重建和参数估计。

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant
challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part
geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural
diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose
KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object
Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing
diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input.
Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part
segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE
(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在从2D图像推断3D几何方面存在空间推理能力不足的问题，限制了从单张图像生成可编辑参数化CAD模型的能力。

Method: 采用两阶段后训练框架：监督微调阶段使用深度和表面法线图作为密集几何先验，与RGB图像形成多通道输入；强化学习阶段引入组长度奖励来促进生成更紧凑的建模序列。

Result: 在DeepCAD和Fusion360数据集上的实验表明，GACO-CAD在相同MLLM骨干下达到最先进性能，在代码有效性、几何精度和建模简洁性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GACO-CAD通过结合几何先验和建模简洁性奖励，成功解决了从单张图像生成可编辑CAD模型的挑战，为工业概念设计降低了门槛。

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Method: 研究了多种最先进对抗攻击在不同预处理技术下的迁移性，分析了人脸检测模型和降采样插值方法的影响，并提出基于输入变换的预处理不变方法来提高攻击迁移性。

Result: 人脸检测模型选择可使攻击成功率降低达78%，而插值方法影响较小。预处理要求即使在白盒设置中也会降低攻击强度。提出的预处理不变方法可将攻击迁移性提高达27%。

Conclusion: 预处理在人脸识别系统中至关重要，考虑预处理因素有助于提高面部对抗样本的对抗泛化能力。

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

Motivation: 解决掩码自回归模型在视觉生成中并行生成能力受限于空间相关视觉令牌建模复杂性的问题。

Method: GtR将生成分解为结构生成和细节重建两阶段，假设基于基本图像框架补充细节比从零创建图像更容易。FTS根据高频信息能量定位图像细节区域，为细节令牌分配更多计算预算。

Result: 在ImageNet类条件生成和文本到图像生成中实现3.72倍加速，同时保持可比质量(FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs 原始1.59, 299.1)。

Conclusion: GtR显著优于现有加速方法，在不同模型规模和生成任务中均表现优异。

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),
substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model
scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 现有GCD方法假设训练时能同时访问标记和未标记数据且来自同一领域，限制了在开放世界场景中的适用性。DG-GCD要求模型泛化到包含新类别的未见领域，而现有方法DG2CD-Net依赖多域模拟训练，计算成本高且存在误差累积。

Conclusion: HIDISC通过双曲表示学习框架有效解决了DG-GCD问题，无需复杂的模拟训练，实现了高效的领域和类别泛化。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

*Pu Zhang,Yuwei Li,Xingyuan Xian,Guoming Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本的视觉token剪枝方法，通过平衡任务相关性和信息多样性，在保持性能的同时显著降低推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型处理能力增强，视觉token冗余导致推理成本急剧上升，现有剪枝方法忽视文本提示的指导，无法优先考虑任务相关性

Method: 采用分层方法：首先选择任务相关的核心视觉token，然后补充多样性token以保留更广泛上下文，实现任务相关性和信息多样性的平衡

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，该方法在剪枝高达90%token的情况下，性能达到或超越最先进方法，仅造成最小精度损失，同时显著降低GPU内存占用和推理延迟

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知视觉token剪枝方法有效解决了视觉语言模型中的token冗余问题，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理效率

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

TL;DR: 使用Segment Anything Model (SAM)来监测孟加拉国河流侵蚀，通过微调模型识别河岸侵蚀特征，在消失的定居点数据集上取得了86.30%的IoU和92.60%的Dice分数。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国河流每年吞噬村庄和农田，造成大规模破坏和人口流离失所，传统人工监测方法效率低下，需要自动化解决方案来跟踪这种缓慢的灾难。

Method: 首先使用简单的颜色通道分析进行粗略的土地和水域分割，然后微调SAM的掩码解码器来识别河岸侵蚀的细微特征。

Result: 模型在河岸侵蚀识别方面表现出色，平均IoU达到86.30%，Dice分数达到92.60%，显著优于传统方法和现成的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个孟加拉国因河流侵蚀消失定居点的标注数据集、专门针对此任务的AI模型以及量化土地损失的方法，为政策制定者和灾害管理机构提供了强大的监测工具。

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电竞比赛结果预测研究多基于比赛日志数据和统计信息，本研究针对需要复杂策略的FPS游戏VALORANT，旨在通过分析比赛录像中的小地图信息来构建回合结果预测模型。

Method: 基于TimeSformer视频识别模型，通过提取小地图信息中的详细战术特征（如角色位置信息和其他游戏内事件）来提高预测准确性。

Result: 在添加战术事件标签的数据集上训练的模型达到了约81%的预测准确率，特别是在回合的中期阶段，显著优于仅使用小地图信息本身训练的模型。

Conclusion: 利用比赛录像中的战术特征对于预测VALORANT回合结果非常有效。

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

TL;DR: EndoCIL是一个专门为内窥镜图像诊断设计的类增量学习框架，通过三个关键组件解决灾难性遗忘问题：基于最大均值差异的重放、先验正则化类平衡损失和全连接梯度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像分析需要持续适应临床数据，但现有重放方法因严重的领域差异和类别不平衡而无法有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出EndoCIL框架，包含：1) MDBR：使用分布对齐的贪心策略选择多样代表性样本；2) PRCBL：整合先验类别分布和平衡权重解决类别不平衡；3) CFG：调整分类器梯度以减少对新类别的偏差。

Result: 在四个公共内窥镜数据集上的实验表明，EndoCIL在不同缓冲区大小和评估指标下普遍优于最先进的CIL方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡了终身内窥镜诊断中的稳定性和可塑性，显示出良好的临床可扩展性和部署潜力。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

Method: 使用带寄存器的DINOv2提取可泛化特征，抑制注意力机制中的扰动，专注于关键微小特征

Result: 在ICCV2025第六届人脸反欺骗研讨会数据集和SiW数据集上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 基于DINOv2的活体检测方法能够有效区分真实人脸和欺骗攻击图像

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:
Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

TL;DR: VisiPruner是一个无需训练的剪枝框架，通过分析MLLMs的三阶段跨模态交互过程，显著减少视觉相关注意力计算和FLOPs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但由于注意力计算的二次增长导致计算开销巨大。现有剪枝方法缺乏对MLLMs如何处理和融合多模态信息的基本理解。

Method: 通过系统分析发现MLLMs存在三阶段跨模态交互：浅层识别任务意图、中层关键视觉令牌驱动跨模态融合、深层丢弃视觉令牌专注语言精炼。基于此提出VisiPruner训练无关剪枝框架。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5 7B上减少高达99%的视觉相关注意力计算和53.9%的FLOPs，显著优于现有令牌剪枝方法，并能泛化到多种MLLMs。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了有效的剪枝解决方案，还为训练高效MLLMs提供了可操作指南，通过使模型架构与其内在的层级处理动态对齐。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法主要关注单时刻检索，但现实应用中一个查询可能对应多个相关时刻，现有数据集和方法不足以应对视频时序定位的挑战。

Method: 提出FlashMMR框架，包含多时刻后验证模块来精炼时刻边界，通过约束时序调整和验证模块重新评估候选片段，通过复杂的过滤管道修剪低置信度提议。

Result: 在QV-M^2数据集上，FlashMMR相比之前SOTA方法在G-mAP上提升3.00%，在mAP@3+tgt上提升2.70%，在mR@3上提升2.56%。

Conclusion: QV-M^2数据集和FlashMMR方法为推进更现实和具有挑战性的视频时序定位研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval
(SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in
real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods
insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between
current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality
datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new
evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists
of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing
efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we
propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment
boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently
leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through
this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and
robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing
MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.
Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and
evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,
on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,
2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method
establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging
video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了深度伪造检测中的偏见问题，同时保持了检测性能，为不同人口统计群体提供了更公平可靠的检测结果。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness
and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented
landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce
FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million
samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources
into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation
performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving

scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for
precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely
on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and
inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the
YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the
target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the
identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved
surgical outcomes.

Motivation: 观察到自监督学习中的反直觉现象——训练时间延长反而会降低密集预测任务（如语义分割）的性能，这种现象在16种最先进的自监督学习方法中普遍存在。由于缺乏无标注情况下评估密集性能的有效方法，需要开发新的评估指标。

Method: 提出了密集表示结构估计器(DSE)，包含类相关性度量和有效维度度量。基于DSE指标开发了模型选择策略和正则化方法。在16种自监督方法和4个基准测试上进行了验证。

Result: 模型选择策略平均提高mIoU 3.0%，计算成本可忽略。DSE正则化方法能持续缓解密集退化效应。

Conclusion: 自监督密集退化是自监督学习中普遍存在的现象，提出的DSE指标能有效评估密集表示质量，基于DSE的模型选择和正则化方法能显著改善密集预测任务的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised
learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction
tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on
sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection
improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost.
Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense
degradation. Code is available at

Result: 实验结果显示全模态模型在需要精确时间定位和长距离因果推理的任务上仍面临挑战，扩展实验揭示了OLMs在多模态融合中的信息丢失和处理偏差问题。

Conclusion: LongInsightBench为评估长视频理解能力提供了重要基准，揭示了当前全模态模型在复杂多模态任务中的局限性，特别是在时间推理和因果推断方面需要进一步改进。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{LongInsightBench}, the first benchmark designed to
assess models' ability to understand long videos, with a focus on human
language, viewpoints, actions, and other contextual elements, while integrating
\textbf{visual, audio, and text} modalities. Our benchmark excels in three key
areas: \textbf{a) Long-Duration, Information-Dense Videos:} We carefully select
approximately 1,000 videos from open-source datasets FineVideo based on
duration limit and the information density of both visual and audio modalities,
focusing on content like lectures, interviews, and vlogs, which contain rich
language elements. \textbf{b) Diverse and Challenging Task Scenarios:} We have
designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and
Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance
Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality
assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized
questions and answer options. Based on LongInsightBench, we designed a series
of experiments. Experimental results shows that Omni-modal models(OLMs) still
face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and
long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the
information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset

### [133] [CausalMamba: Scalable Conditional State Space Models for Neural Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17318)
*Sangyoon Bae,Jiook Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalMamba是一个可扩展的fMRI因果推断框架，通过两阶段方法解决BOLD信号失真和计算复杂度问题，在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%，在真实数据中能恢复88%的已知神经通路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决fMRI因果推断中的基本限制：从血流动力学失真的BOLD信号推断神经因果关系的病态性质，以及现有方法（如DCM）的计算不可行性。

Method: 将复杂逆问题分解为两个可处理阶段：BOLD反卷积恢复潜在神经活动，然后使用新颖的条件Mamba架构进行因果图推断。

Result: 在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%；在真实任务fMRI数据中恢复88%的已知神经通路，而传统方法在99%以上的受试者中无法识别这些典型回路；工作记忆数据的网络分析显示大脑会根据刺激策略性地转移主要因果枢纽。

Conclusion: 为神经科学家提供了一个实用的工具，用于大规模因果推断，能够捕捉认知功能背后的基本回路模式和灵活网络动态。

Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental
limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring
neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the
computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling
(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental
circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了现有对抗性防御方法对抗大尺寸对抗性衣服攻击的效果，发现这些防御方法在面对覆盖人体大部分区域的对抗性衣服时表现不佳，揭示了现有防御方法的共同脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验发现简单增大对抗性补丁的尺寸就能使现有防御方法失效，因此需要评估防御方法对抗大尺寸对抗性衣服攻击的效果，因为对抗性衣服不仅尺寸大，而且比人体上的大补丁看起来更自然。

Method: 通过制作对抗性衣服在数字世界和物理世界测试多种防御方法，包括在Faster R-CNN上制作能突破多种防御方法的单一服装集合。

Result: 所有防御方法在对抗对抗性衣服时表现都很差。制作的一组对抗性衣服在物理世界中，对未防御检测器的攻击成功率达到96.06%，对九个防御模型的攻击成功率均超过64.84%。

Conclusion: 现有对抗性防御方法在面对大尺寸对抗性衣服攻击时存在共同脆弱性，需要开发更强大的防御机制来应对这类攻击。

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
adversarial clothes. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出CharDiff框架，通过字符级引导的扩散模型有效恢复和识别严重退化的车牌图像，在恢复质量和识别准确率上显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车牌图像恢复不仅对车牌识别系统预处理很重要，还能提高证据价值、增强视觉界面清晰度，促进车牌图像的进一步利用。

Method: 使用基于扩散的框架，通过外部分割和OCR模块提取细粒度字符级先验，并引入字符引导注意力区域掩码模块，确保每个字符的引导仅限于自身区域。

Result: 在Roboflow-LP数据集上，相比最佳基线模型实现了28%的相对CER降低，在恢复质量和识别准确率方面显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结构化字符引导条件化有效增强了基于扩散的车牌恢复和识别在实际部署场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) has progressed from scalar quality prediction
to more interpretable, human-aligned evaluation paradigms. In this work, we
address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing
iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of
simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and
description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these
heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation
modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online
enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate
our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the
ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality
assessments.

TL;DR: 提出一种后处理开放集识别方法，通过测量模型特征与预测logits之间的一致性来识别未知类，无需重新训练预训练模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有野生动物分类模型在闭集设置下训练，面对未知类别时预测过于自信。现有开放集识别方法大多需要重新训练模型，存在局限性

Method: 基于输入到最近类均值的距离构建概率分布，将该分布与softmax概率进行比较来衡量NCM与分类头之间的一致性

Result: 在两个数据集上均排名前三，表现一致。在非洲和瑞典动物数据集上分别达到93.41和95.35的AUROC

Conclusion: 提出的后处理方法在开放集识别任务中表现优异且稳定，优于现有方法

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-E2VID框架，通过跨模态特征对齐和语义感知特征融合，将视觉语义知识从帧模态迁移到事件模态，显著提升事件到视频重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机仅捕获强度变化，忽略静态对象和背景，导致事件模态缺乏语义信息。现有E2V方法往往忽视语义信息在视频重建中的重要作用。

Method: 引入跨模态特征对齐模块将SAM模型的视觉语义知识迁移到事件编码器；设计语义感知特征融合块整合学习到的语义特征；提出语义感知E2V监督机制利用SAM生成的类别标签。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升帧质量，优于最先进的E2V方法。

Conclusion: Semantic-E2VID通过有效利用视觉语义知识，成功解决了事件模态语义信息缺失的问题，显著改善了事件到视频重建性能。

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设备上部署实时空间感知需要高效的多任务模型，能够利用互补任务信息同时最小化计算开销。

Method: 基于轻量级ViT DINOv2骨干网络，引入窗口跨任务注意力模块，实现结构化特征交换同时保留任务特定细节。

Result: 在NYUDv2上超越最先进多任务模型，在Hypersim上优于单任务深度和语义基线，在Cityscapes上表现优异，在笔记本电脑硬件上保持计算效率。

Conclusion: M2H作为单目空间感知系统的基础，支持动态环境中的3D场景图构建，在实际数据验证中展示了实用性。

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient
multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing
computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel
multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth,
edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared
encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task
Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving
task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on
a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time
deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception
systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments.
Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task
models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on
Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all
while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond
benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality
in spatial perception tasks.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型需要完整访问视频才能回答问题，无法满足流式场景下对小时级视频进行实时处理的需求。

Method: 1) 基于LLM注意力机制筛选重要视觉token，可丢弃约95%不重要token；2) 递归处理历史选定token以保持时间连贯性；3) 基于描述的轻量级问答机制。

Result: 在流式视频基准测试中达到最先进性能，在效率和效果之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频大语言模型在流式场景中的应用提供了有效的解决方案，无需额外训练即可显著提升处理效率。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos
in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries.
However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多面部表情特征融合的帕金森病严重程度诊断方法，通过注意力机制融合多种表情特征，并采用自适应类别平衡策略解决类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于面部表情的PD诊断方法依赖单一表情类型易导致误诊，且忽略不同PD阶段类别不平衡问题，大多仅进行二分类而非严重程度诊断。

Method: 整合多种面部表情特征通过注意力机制进行特征融合，采用自适应类别平衡策略根据类别分布和分类难度动态调整训练样本贡献度。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在PD严重程度诊断方面表现优异，注意力特征融合和自适应类别平衡策略有效。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多表情特征融合和类别平衡策略，有效提升了PD严重程度诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LoopTrans闭环框架，通过双向知识转移（从外中心到自我中心再返回）改进弱监督的affordance定位，解决传统单向转移在复杂交互场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅从外中心图像单向提取affordance知识并转移到自我中心图像，在复杂交互场景中适用性有限。人类通过观察他人与物体交互来学习新物体的使用方式，需要更有效的知识转移机制。

Method: LoopTrans闭环框架，包含统一跨模态定位和去噪知识蒸馏机制，实现从外中心到自我中心再到外中心的双向知识转移，弥合两种视角间的领域差距。

Result: 在图像和视频基准测试中所有指标均取得一致提升，即使在人体完全遮挡物体交互区域的挑战性场景下也能有效处理。

Conclusion: LoopTrans通过闭环双向知识转移显著提升了affordance定位性能，证明了双向知识交换比传统单向转移更有效。

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements
across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging
scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human
body.

Result: 定性评估显示系统在马匹相关事件检测上表现可靠，但人员检测因数据稀缺存在局限。

Conclusion: 这项工作为马术设施中的实时行为监测奠定了基础，对动物福利和厩舍管理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of
health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
(correct matches).

*Julien Zouein,Hossein Javidnia,François Pitié,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用AV1运动向量生成密集亚像素对应关系和经过余弦一致性过滤的短轨迹，在压缩域前端实现与SIFT相当的性能但CPU使用更少，在SfM演示中成功重建大量点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征匹配方法如SIFT计算量大，而视频压缩中已有的运动向量可被重新利用来生成对应关系，从而提供更高效的视觉前端处理方案。

Method: 重新利用AV1视频编码中的运动向量来生成密集的亚像素级对应关系，并通过余弦一致性过滤短轨迹，在压缩域进行特征匹配。

Result: 在117帧视频上，运动向量匹配成功配准所有图像并重建46-62万个点云，重投影误差为0.51-0.53像素，匹配密度与BA时间成正比。

Conclusion: 压缩域对应关系是一种实用且资源高效的前端方法，具有在完整流程中扩展的清晰路径。

Abstract: We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences
and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this
compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far
less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a
small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and
reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows
with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a
practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full
pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像去雨面临场景复杂性和高质量数据集缺乏的挑战，现有数据集不能准确反映雨和光照的耦合效应

Method: 开发CST-Net网络，包含可学习颜色空间转换器(CSC)在Y通道进行雨去除，引入隐式光照指导提升模型在复杂场景中的鲁棒性

Result: 实验证明数据集的价值和方法的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的HQ-NightRain数据集和CST-Net方法为夜间图像去雨任务提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

*Feng Zhou,Wenkai Guo,Pu Cao,Zhicheng Zhang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进稀疏视图3D高斯溅射(3DGS)初始化的方法，通过增强SfM点云来避免过拟合训练视图导致的渲染伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过增强初始化或添加训练时约束来解决稀疏视图3DGS的过拟合问题，但研究发现初始化是决定性因素，决定了性能上限，而训练时约束只能带来有限的改进。

Method: 设计了三种技术：(1)频率感知SfM，通过低频视图增强和宽松多视图对应改进低纹理区域覆盖；(2)3DGS自初始化，将光度监督提升为额外点，用学习的高斯中心补偿SfM稀疏区域；(3)点云正则化，通过几何/可见性先验强制多视图一致性和均匀空间覆盖。

Result: 在LLFF和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图设置下取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法作为一种更强的初始化策略，有效解决了稀疏视图3DGS的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有占用世界模型依赖静态固定嵌入或网格，限制了感知灵活性，且其网格内分类方法与真实场景的动态连续性存在潜在不匹配。

Method: 提出Range-Adaptive Perception模块（可学习查询通过自车状态调制并增强时空关联）和State-Conditioned Forecasting模块（用回归引导公式替代基于分类的预测），以及Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling训练策略。

Result: 在感知、预测和规划任务中达到最先进性能，验证了模型在灵活性、适应性和效率方面的优势。

Conclusion: SparseWorld通过稀疏动态查询成功解决了现有占用世界模型的局限性，为4D环境建模提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POTNet通过熵引导的双聚类头和最优传输技术生成高质量伪掩码，AutoSOD基于此构建了无需像素级标签的端到端无监督显著目标检测系统，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测(SOD)作为计算机视觉基础任务，需要大量像素级标注。作者认为当有可靠伪掩码时，SOD可以达到接近全监督的精度，但现有方法在原型质量和全局一致性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出POTNet，改进原型最优传输方法：使用熵引导的双聚类头（高熵像素用谱聚类，低熵像素用k-means），然后通过最优传输对齐两个原型集，生成更清晰的伪掩码。基于此构建AutoSOD端到端无监督管道。

Result: 在5个基准测试上，AutoSOD比无监督方法F-measure提升26%，比弱监督方法提升36%，进一步缩小了与全监督模型的差距。

Conclusion: 通过改进原型生成和全局一致性约束，无需像素级标签也能实现高质量的显著目标检测，证明了无监督SOD的可行性。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap
to fully supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于评分准则和伪标签的零样本视频摘要框架，通过将少量真实标注转化为伪标签来指导LLM进行可解释的场景评估，在无需训练的情况下接近监督方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督方法标注成本高且跨数据集泛化能力有限，无监督方法难以捕捉高层次语义，零样本方法对提示模板和分数归一化敏感，需要一种更稳定、可泛化的零样本视频摘要方法。

Method: 将少量真实标注转化为高置信度伪标签，聚合成结构化、数据集自适应的评分准则，在推理时对首尾片段仅基于描述评分，中间片段加入相邻场景的上下文摘要来评估叙事进展和冗余度。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上分别达到57.58和63.05的F1分数，超越了无监督和之前的零样本基线方法，接近监督方法的性能。

Conclusion: 评分准则引导的伪标签方法有效稳定了基于LLM的评分，为视频摘要建立了一个通用、可解释的零样本范式。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,
surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into
concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video
summarization.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public
release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits
Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node
scaling, details are available in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习分割模型主要针对单时间点和专家标注数据训练，不适用于纵向主动监测分析，因为存在多个时间点和专家标注稀缺的问题。

Method: 提出半监督、双扫描3D分割架构MambaX-Net，包含Mamba增强交叉注意力模块和形状提取器模块，采用半监督自训练策略利用预训练nnU-Net生成的伪标签。

Conclusion: MambaX-Net通过有效利用时间信息和半监督学习，解决了纵向前列腺癌主动监测中的分割挑战，为自动化监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

Motivation: 为了减少对昂贵像素级标注的依赖，开发一种仅需图像级标签的弱监督道路裂缝检测方法，以支持智能城市基础设施维护。

Method: 集成三个组件：分类器生成类激活图、重建器测量特征可推断性、检测器生成像素级检测结果。通过对抗学习使裂缝CAM覆盖完整区域，检测器从后处理的伪标签中学习。设计了路径感知注意力模块和中心增强CAM一致性模块。

Result: 在三个图像级数据集上的实验表明，WP-CrackNet达到与监督方法相当的结果，优于现有弱监督方法，显著推进了可扩展的道路检测。

Conclusion: WP-CrackNet通过弱监督学习实现了有效的道路裂缝检测，减少了标注成本，为智能基础设施维护提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

Motivation: 现有的3D前馈模型在静态数据集上训练，难以处理包含动态元素（如移动人物或可变形物体）的真实世界场景。

Method: 提出动态感知聚合器，通过预测动态感知掩码来分离静态和动态信息：抑制运动线索用于姿态估计，增强运动线索用于几何重建。

Result: 在动态场景中持续优于原始VGGT模型，在相机姿态估计、单目和视频深度估计以及密集点云重建方面取得优越结果。

Conclusion: PAGE-4D成功解决了动态场景中多任务重建的内在冲突，无需后处理即可实现4D重建任务。

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Conclusion: 成功构建了首个水下伪装实例分割数据集，并开发了有效的UCIS-SAM网络，显著提升了水下伪装物体的分割性能。

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

Conclusion: 该自动化方法提高了3D基础设施模型分割的精度和效率，推动了无人机与BIM技术在结构健康监测和基础设施管理中的集成应用。

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

*Jia Guo,Shuai Lu,Lei Fan,Zelin Li,Donglin Di,Yang Song,Weihang Zhang,Wenbing Zhu,Hong Yan,Fang Chen,Huiqi Li,Hongen Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dinomaly2是首个全谱图像无监督异常检测统一框架，通过五个简单元素的协同作用在标准重建框架中实现卓越性能，在多类模型上超越了现有最佳一对一模型，并自然扩展到多种任务设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督异常检测领域已从专用单类模型发展到统一多类模型，但现有多类模型性能显著落后于最先进的一对一模型，且领域碎片化为针对特定场景的专用方法，需要统一解决方案。

Method: 基于"少即是多"理念，在标准重建框架中协调五个简单元素，这种极简方法设计使得无需修改即可自然扩展到多样化任务。

Result: 在12个UAD基准测试中，Dinomaly2在多种模态、任务设置和应用领域展现全谱优越性。多类模型在MVTec-AD和VisA上分别达到99.9%和99.3%的图像级AUROC；仅使用每类8个正常样本就超越先前全样本模型，在相同数据集上达到98.7%和97.4% I-AUROC。

Conclusion: 极简设计、计算可扩展性和通用适用性的结合使Dinomaly2成为现实世界异常检测应用全谱的统一解决方案，证明了简单性是真正普遍性的基础。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaMiT数据集包含787K标注样本和5.1M未标注样本，涵盖190种汽车模型（2007-2023），用于研究视觉系统的时间适应性。研究发现静态预训练在跨年测试时准确率下降，提出了时间增量分类设置和两种改进策略，以及时间感知图像生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统需要适应不断演变的视觉环境，特别是在对象外观随时间变化的领域。汽车模型作为技术制品的代表类别，其时间演化特性为研究视觉系统的时间适应性提供了理想场景。

Method: 1. 构建CaMiT数据集支持监督和自监督学习；2. 提出时间增量分类设置，模拟现实中的持续学习场景；3. 评估两种策略：时间增量预训练（更新主干网络）和时间增量分类器学习（仅更新最后一层）；4. 探索时间感知图像生成方法。

Result: 静态预训练在域内数据上能达到与大规模通用模型竞争的性能且更高效，但在跨年测试时准确率下降。时间增量预训练和时间增量分类器学习都能提高时间鲁棒性。时间感知图像生成能产生更真实的输出。

Conclusion: CaMiT为研究细粒度视觉识别和生成中的时间适应问题提供了丰富的基准，提出的时间增量学习方法能有效提升模型在时间演化环境中的性能。

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains
where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time
(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

*Zexian Huang,Mashnoon Islam,Brian Armstrong,Kourosh Khoshelham,Martin Tomko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINO-CV是一个用于自动映射低矮干石墙的分割框架，使用高分辨率机载LiDAR衍生的数字高程模型（DEMs）来克服植被遮挡问题，并通过自监督跨视图预训练策略解决标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干石墙具有重要的遗产和环境价值，但由于其难以接近和手动映射成本高昂，许多墙体未被识别。深度学习分割提供了可扩展的解决方案，但面临植被遮挡和标注数据有限两大挑战。

Method: 提出DINO-CV分割框架，利用DEMs克服植被遮挡，捕捉植被下方地形结构。引入基于知识蒸馏的自监督跨视图预训练策略，学习多个DEM衍生物的视觉和几何表示，支持多种视觉骨干网络。

Result: 在澳大利亚Budj Bim UNESCO世界遗产文化景观中应用，识别出澳大利亚最密集的殖民干石墙集合。测试区域平均交并比（mIoU）达到68.6%，仅使用10%标注数据微调后仍保持63.8% mIoU。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在高分辨率DEM衍生物上进行自监督学习，对于在植被茂密且标注稀缺的遗产丰富环境中自动映射干石墙具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较两种节俭联邦学习方法：零样本和联邦微调视觉语言模型(VLMs)与个性化训练紧凑3D卷积神经网络(CNN3D)，用于暴力检测。两种方法准确率均超90%，CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优且能耗更低，VLMs在上下文推理和多模态推理上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究节俭联邦学习方法进行暴力检测，重点关注能源效率和环境指标，为视频监控提供负责任、资源感知的AI基准。

Method: 使用LLaVA-7B和65.8M参数CNN3D作为代表案例，在非IID设置下评估准确性、校准和能耗。比较零样本和联邦微调VLMs与个性化训练CNN3D两种策略。

Result: 两种方法准确率均超过90%。CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优于LoRA微调的VLMs，同时能耗更低。VLMs在上下文推理和多模态推理方面保持优势。量化了训练和推理过程中的能耗和CO2排放。

Conclusion: 支持混合模型：轻量级CNN用于常规分类，选择性激活VLM用于复杂或描述性场景。该框架为视频监控中的负责任、资源感知AI提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.
CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and
log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual
reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions
across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for
deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings
support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with
selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting
framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in
video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and
lifecycle-aware systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DSegStreamer是一个用于4D全景分割的流式处理框架，采用双线程系统实现实时处理，可集成到现有3D/4D分割方法中，在动态环境中表现出优越的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高度动态环境中（如密集人群疏散、复杂自动驾驶场景）需要实时、细粒度的感知能力，但现有方法在有限时间预算下难以满足实时性要求。

Method: 采用双线程系统：预测线程利用历史运动和几何信息提取特征并预测未来动态；推理线程通过对齐最新记忆并补偿自运动和动态物体运动来确保对输入帧的及时预测。

Result: 在HOI4D、SemanticKITTI和nuScenes数据集上的综合实验表明，该方法在复杂场景中准确预测动态物体方面表现有效，特别是在高FPS条件下优于现有流式感知方法。

Conclusion: 4DSegStreamer是一个通用且高效的流式处理框架，能够显著提升4D全景分割的实时性能，在动态环境中具有优越的鲁棒性。

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and
compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate
4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and
nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex
scenes.

TL;DR: 提出PICABench基准和PICAEval评估协议，系统评估图像编辑的物理真实性，涵盖光学、力学和状态转换等8个子维度，发现当前模型在物理真实性方面仍有很大改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型主要关注指令完成度，但忽视了编辑操作伴随的物理效应（如阴影、反射、物体间相互作用），这些物理效应对生成真实感至关重要。

Method: 构建PICABench基准系统评估物理真实性，提出PICAEval评估协议使用VLM作为评判器，并构建PICA-100K训练数据集从视频中学习物理知识。

Result: 评估主流模型后发现，物理真实性仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，存在很大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 该工作为从简单内容编辑向物理一致的真实感编辑转变提供了基准和解决方案基础。

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割基础模型微调方法存在两个问题：高层特征表示不足，以及微调过程破坏预训练权重结构完整性。

Method: 1) 构建基础专家、语义专家和自适应专家，采用像素概率自适应投票策略进行专家选择和融合；2) 提出语义引导对比学习方法解决对比学习中弱监督问题。

Result: 在三个公共医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，IC-MoE优于其他SOTA模型，并验证了其在多样化医学图像分割场景中的优越泛化能力。

Conclusion: IC-MoE有效补充了基础医学图像分割模型的高层特征和预训练结构完整性，在医学图像分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有文本-图像行人检索方法存在两个问题：全局方法忽略细粒度跨模态差异，局部方法需要先验信息；且当前方法主要针对英语，限制了在多语言环境中的应用。

Method: 提出Bi-IRRA框架，包含双向隐式关系推理模块（通过双向预测掩码图像和文本来隐式增强跨语言和跨模态的局部关系建模）和多维全局对齐模块（用于桥接模态异质性）。

Result: 在所有多语言TIPR数据集上取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: Bi-IRRA框架有效解决了多语言文本-图像行人检索中的模态异质性问题，为多语言环境下的行人检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in
https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Conclusion: OP3Det通过融合2D和3D先验知识，实现了广义的3D物体发现，在开放世界场景中表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Conclusion: 广义对抗求解器提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，在减少计算成本的同时保持了高质量的生成结果。

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only
available in a limited set of pre-determined sizes, forcing sub-optimal
deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT:
Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new
post-pretraining structured pruning method that enables elastic inference
across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines
gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated
via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to
models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on
DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five
minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to
any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning
strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation
of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring
mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or
labels. Code and pruned models are available at: https://elastic.ashita.nl/

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in
prior work.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个自动分析循环血细胞簇图像的计算框架，通过两步策略实现细胞簇分类和细胞类型识别，准确率超过95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式细胞术结合荧光染色常用于分析循环血细胞簇，但现有机器学习方法主要针对单细胞分析，缺乏自动分析细胞簇图像的工具。细胞簇具有不规则形状、大小和异质性细胞类型，需要多通道染色来识别。

Method: 采用两步分析策略：首先使用YOLOv11模型对图像进行细胞簇与非细胞簇分类；然后通过叠加细胞簇轮廓与多通道荧光染色区域来识别细胞类型，有效处理细胞碎片和染色伪影。

Result: 该框架在细胞簇分类和表型识别方面均达到95%以上的准确率，优于传统CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架有效分析流式细胞术中的循环血细胞簇图像，利用明场和荧光数据，具有扩展到分析免疫细胞和肿瘤细胞簇等更广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

Conclusion: 为开发更鲁棒的雨滴条件下3DGS方法提供了明确方向，强调了处理真实雨滴干扰的重要性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question
answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world

extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source
MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in
handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available

Motivation: 现有的离线签名验证方法在跨数据集泛化方面存在困难，因为笔迹风格和采集协议的变化会降低性能，需要研究能提高跨数据集鲁棒性的特征学习策略。

Method: 使用CEDAR、ICDAR和GPDS Synthetic三个公共基准数据集，开发了两种实验流程：基于原始签名图像的方法和使用壳预处理的方法。

Result: 原始图像模型在基准测试中取得了更高的性能，而基于壳预处理的方法显示出未来改进的潜力，但两种方法之间没有明确的优劣之分。

Conclusion: 原始图像方法在当前表现更好，但壳预处理方法为未来开发鲁棒的跨域签名验证系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

Motivation: 解决多参考视觉地点识别中，现有方法面临训练成本高、计算复杂度大、以及启发式融合方法在应对外观和视点变化时性能提升有限的问题。

Method: 使用矩阵分解将多个参考描述符联合建模为基表示，通过投影实现残差匹配，无需训练过程且与具体描述符类型无关。

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

Motivation: 皮肤癌早期检测对患者预后至关重要，但现有深度学习模型存在"黑盒"问题，缺乏临床信任。

Conclusion: 结合精确病变分割、临床数据和注意力融合，可构建更准确、可解释的皮肤癌分类模型。

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

TL;DR: SparseVILA是一种高效的视觉语言模型推理范式，通过在预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，在解码阶段仅检索查询相关token，实现端到端2.6倍加速，同时提升文档理解和推理任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的扩展性受到视觉token数量增长的限制，这些token主导了推理延迟。需要一种方法在保持模型能力的同时显著提升推理效率。

Method: 提出解耦视觉稀疏性方法：预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，解码阶段仅检索查询相关token。基于AWQ优化的推理管道，保留大部分视觉缓存以保持多轮对话保真度。

Result: 在长上下文视频任务上实现4.0倍预填充加速、2.5倍解码加速和2.6倍端到端加速，同时在文档理解和推理任务上提高准确性。

Conclusion: SparseVILA通过解耦查询无关剪枝和查询感知检索，为高效多模态推理开辟了新方向，提供无需训练、架构无关的框架来加速大型视觉语言模型而不牺牲能力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

TL;DR: UltraCUA是一个基础模型，通过混合动作机制将GUI基本操作与高级程序化工具调用无缝集成，显著提升了计算机使用代理的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机使用代理仅依赖基本操作（点击、输入、滚动），需要精确的视觉定位和冗长的执行链，导致级联故障和性能瓶颈，而其他代理可以利用丰富的程序化接口，因此需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 采用四个关键组件：自动化管道从软件文档、开源仓库和代码生成中扩展程序化工具；合成数据引擎生成超过17,000个可验证任务；大规模高质量混合动作轨迹收集；两阶段训练管道结合监督微调和在线强化学习。

Result: 在OSWorld上，UltraCUA模型相比基础模型实现了22%的相对改进，步骤速度提升11%；在WindowsAgentArena的域外评估中达到21.7%的成功率，优于在Windows数据上训练的基线模型。

Conclusion: 混合动作机制对于减少错误传播同时保持执行效率至关重要，UltraCUA成功弥合了计算机使用代理与其他代理在程序化接口利用方面的差距。

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理百万级token长上下文时面临的计算和内存成本过高的问题。

Method: 将长文本渲染成图像，使用视觉语言模型处理，并设计基于LLM的遗传搜索来优化视觉渲染配置。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试中达到与Qwen3-8B相当的准确性，同时实现3-4倍token压缩、4倍预填充和解码速度提升，以及2倍SFT训练加速。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文缩放是解决长上下文建模挑战的有效方法，能够在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练自由注意力控制方法在编辑强度与一致性之间存在权衡，特别是在多轮和视频编辑中视觉错误会累积，且全局一致性限制了细粒度编辑能力。

Method: 基于MM-DiT架构分析，提出视觉专用注意力控制、掩码引导预注意力融合、以及查询/键/值令牌的差异化操作。

Result: 在广泛图像和视频编辑任务中达到最先进性能，支持所有推理步骤和注意力层的编辑，无需手工调整，实现鲁棒的多轮和多区域编辑。

Conclusion: ConsistEdit是首个无需手工调整即可在所有推理步骤和注意力层进行编辑的方法，显著提升了可靠性和一致性，支持渐进式结构一致性调整。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage sketch-based smoke illustration
generation framework using stream function and latent diffusion models (LDM).
The user sketch is used to guide the generation of the stream function, which
serves as the control condition for the velocity field generator. The generated
velocity field can be used to guide the smoke simulation to align with the
intended flow. We adopt streamlines to encode global flow dynamics as sketch
guidance during training. The stream function constitutes the intermediate
representation that captures continuous variation and rotational flow details

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了流体动画中的运动控制问题，为静态图像添加动态流体效果提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Integrating motion into static images not only enhances visual expressiveness
but also creates a sense of immersion and temporal depth, establishing it as a
longstanding and impactful theme in artistic expression. Fluid elements such as
waterfall, river, and oceans are common features in landscape, but their
complex dynamic characteristics pose significant challenges in modeling and
controlling their motion within visual computing. Physics-based methods are
often used in fluid animation to track particle movement. However, they are
easily affected by boundary conditions. Recently, latent diffusion models have
been applied to video generation tasks, demonstrating impressive capabilities
in producing high-quality and temporally coherent results. However, it is
challenging for the existing methods to animate fluid smooth and temporally
consistent motion. To solve these issues, this paper introduces a framework for
generating landscape videos by animating fluid in still images under the
guidance of motion sketches. We propose a finetuned conditional latent
diffusion model for generating motion field from user-provided sketches, which
are subsequently integrated into a latent video diffusion model via a motion
adapter to precisely control the fluid movement.

Motivation: 传统交互式渲染方法受限于固定的采样模式，无法精细适应时空颜色变化。无帧渲染可以更灵活地适应图像边缘和运动区域。

Method: 使用闭环反馈指导采样到图像边缘或运动区域；时域深度缓冲存储短时间内的所有采样；GPU重建响应采样密度和时空颜色梯度；利用样本重投影改进重建。

Result: 在模拟中，无帧渲染器比传统渲染方法减少一个数量级的采样数量（以RMS误差衡量），同时计算开销仅占15%。

Conclusion: 自适应无帧渲染方法在保持视觉质量的同时大幅提升渲染速度，特别适合处理静态和动态场景的混合情况。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive form of frameless rendering with the potential to
dramatically increase rendering speed over conventional interactive rendering
approaches. Without the rigid sampling patterns of framed renderers, sampling
and reconstruction can adapt with very fine granularity to spatio-temporal
color change. A sampler uses closed-loop feedback to guide sampling toward
edges or motion in the image. Temporally deep buffers store all the samples
created over a short time interval for use in reconstruction and as sampler
feedback. GPU-based reconstruction responds both to sampling density and
space-time color gradients. Where the displayed scene is static, spatial color
change dominates and older samples are given significant weight in
reconstruction, resulting in sharper and eventually antialiased images. Where
the scene is dynamic, more recent samples are emphasized, resulting in less
sharp but more up-to-date images. We also use sample reprojection to improve
reconstruction and guide sampling toward occlusion edges, undersampled regions,
and specular highlights. In simulation our frameless renderer requires an order
of magnitude fewer samples than traditional rendering of similar visual quality
(as measured by RMS error), while introducing overhead amounting to 15% of
computation time.

Motivation: 传统骨架化方法通常假设体积解释，而本方法直接在表面上操作，确保结果表示对导航感知的几何分析保持相关性。

Method: 首先提取表面的图表示作为结构分析基础，然后生成Steiner树来优化关键终端点之间的连接，最后利用视线约束减少冗余并保持基本连通性。

Result: 验证了两个用例：从基于图块的元素中提取结构表示用于程序化内容生成，以及识别关键点和结构指标用于自动化关卡分析。

Conclusion: 该方法能够产生简化的、连贯的表示，支持程序化生成、空间推理和地图分析等应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method to extract a hierarchical tree representation
from 3D unorganized polygonal data. The proposed approach first extracts a
graph representation of the surface, which serves as the foundation for
structural analysis. A Steiner tree is then generated to establish an optimized
connection between key terminal points, defined according to
application-specific criteria. The structure can be further refined by
leveraging line-of-sight constraints, reducing redundancy while preserving
essential connectivity. Unlike traditional skeletonization techniques, which
often assume volumetric interpretations, this method operates directly on the
surface, ensuring that the resulting representation remains relevant for
navigation-aware geometric analysis. The method is validated through two use
cases: extracting structural representations from tile-based elements for
procedural content generation, and identifying key points and structural
metrics for automated level analysis. Results demonstrate its ability to
produce simplified, coherent representations, supporting applications in
procedural generation, spatial reasoning, and map analysis.

Abstract: Synthesizing 3D scenes from open-vocabulary text descriptions is a
challenging, important, and recently-popular application. One of its critical
subproblems is layout generation: given a set of objects, lay them out to
produce a scene matching the input description. Nearly all recent work adopts a
declarative paradigm for this problem: using an LLM to generate a specification
of constraints between objects, then solving those constraints to produce the
final layout. In contrast, we explore an alternative imperative paradigm, in
which an LLM iteratively places objects, with each object's position and
orientation computed as a function of previously-placed objects. The imperative
approach allows for a simpler scene specification language while also handling
a wider variety and larger complexity of scenes. We further improve the
robustness of our imperative scheme by developing an error correction mechanism
that iteratively improves the scene's validity while staying as close as
possible to the original layout generated by the LLM. In forced-choice
perceptual studies, participants preferred layouts generated by our imperative
approach 82% and 94% of the time when compared against two declarative layout
generation methods. We also present a simple, automated evaluation metric for
3D scene layout generation that aligns well with human preferences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对持久性图和合并树的广义Wasserstein距离，通过考虑拓扑特征在输入域中的区域信息，提供比传统Wasserstein距离更具区分性的度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Wasserstein距离在比较拓扑特征时忽略了它们在输入域中的区域信息，限制了度量的区分能力。本文旨在利用这些区域信息来改进拓扑特征的比较。

Method: 重新定义拓扑特征的比较为极值对齐区域值之间的距离，通过输入参数调整区域属性在距离中的影响。提供两种策略控制计算时间和内存使用：使用区域子集进行计算，以及压缩区域属性获得低内存表示。

Result: 在公开可用的集成数据上进行广泛实验，平均运行时间在分钟级别。应用包括：跟踪时变集成中拓扑特征的演化，计算用于降维的距离矩阵，并检测集成中的关键阶段。

Conclusion: 提出的广义Wasserstein距离比传统方法更具区分性，计算效率高，并在拓扑数据分析中具有实际应用价值。提供了C++实现以确保结果可复现。

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the Wasserstein distance for both
persistence diagrams and merge trees [20], [66] that takes advantage of the
regions of their topological features in the input domain. Specifically, we
redefine the comparison of topological features as a distance between the
values of their extrema-aligned regions. It results in a more discriminative
metric than the classical Wasserstein distance and generalizes it through an
input parameter adjusting the impact of the region properties in the distance.
We present two strategies to control both computation time and memory storage
of our method by respectively enabling the use of subsets of the regions in the
computation, and by compressing the regions' properties to obtain low-memory
representations. Extensive experiments on openly available ensemble data
demonstrate the efficiency of our method, with running times on the orders of
minutes on average. We show the utility of our contributions with two
applications. First, we use the assignments between topological features
provided by our method to track their evolution in time-varying ensembles and
propose the temporal persistence curves to facilitate the understanding of how
these features appear, disappear and change over time. Second, our method
allows to compute a distance matrix of an ensemble that can be used for
dimensionality reduction purposes and visually represent in 2D all its members,
we show that such distance matrices also allow to detect key phases in the
ensemble. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation that can be used to
reproduce our results.

Motivation: 从CT扫描或MRI等扫描数据构建的等值面通常包含大量微小分量，这些分量会分散可视化注意力且不构成任何几何模型的一部分。

Method: 使用简单的数据预过滤技术来去除等值面中的微小分量。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能有效移除小分量，同时保持主要可视化部分不受影响。

Conclusion: 简单的预过滤方法可以有效消除等值面中的微小干扰成分，改善可视化效果。

Abstract: Let $f: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a scalar field. An isosurface
is a piecewise linear approximation of a level set $f^{-1}(\sigma)$ for some
$\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$ built from some regular grid sampling of $f$.
Isosurfaces constructed from scanned data such as CT scans or MRIs often
contain extremely small components that distract from the visualization and do
not form part of any geometric model produced from the data. Simple
prefiltering of the data can remove such small components while having no
effect on the large components that form the body of the visualization. We
present experimental results on such filtering.

Motivation: 随着模拟产生的数据超过超级计算机的磁盘空间，许多模拟采用原地分析和可视化来减少需要存储的数据量。但原地可视化的效果受到先验知识需求的限制：需要知道可视化参数以突出感兴趣特征，且无法提前知道运行原地工作流所需的资源量。

Method: 开发SeerX服务，这是一个轻量级、可扩展的传输中原地服务，支持动态资源分配和3D模拟数据的有损压缩。该服务允许多个模拟将分析任务卸载到共享的弹性服务基础设施中，无需MPI同步。

Conclusion: SeerX解决了原地分析中的先验知识问题，通过弹性服务基础设施支持动态资源分配，提高了原地分析的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: As simulations produce more data than available disk space on supercomputers,
many simulations are employing in situ analysis and visualization to reduce the
amount of data that needs to be stored. While in situ visualization offers
potential for substantial data reduction, its efficacy is hindered by the need
for a priori knowledge. First, we need to know what visualization parameters to
use to highlight features of interest. Second, we do not know ahead of time how
much resources will be needed to run the in situ workflows, e.g. how many
compute nodes will be needed for in situ work. In this work, we present SeerX,
a lightweight, scalable in-transit in situ service that supports dynamic
resource allocation and lossy compression of 3D simulation data. SeerX enables
multiple simulations to offload analysis to a shared, elastic service
infrastructure without MPI synchronization.

TL;DR: SAIP是首个考虑身体形状差异的稀疏惯性运动捕捉解决方案，通过分解传感器测量中的形状和姿态信息，能够有效处理不同体型（如儿童）的运动捕捉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖标准成人身体形状模板，难以泛化到体型差异较大的个体（如儿童），主要原因是身体形状变化会导致IMU测量的加速度发生变化。

Method: 1. 训练回归模型将真实身体的IMU测量加速度转换到匹配模板成人身体模型；2. 使用现有方法估计模板形状身体的全身运动；3. 使用第二个回归模型将关节速度映射回真实身体，结合形状感知的物理优化策略计算全局运动；4. 引入首个惯性形状估计方案，使用MLP网络建模形状条件化的IMU-姿态相关性。

Result: 构建了首个包含不同体型个体的IMU运动捕捉数据集（10名儿童和10名成人，身高110-190cm，共400分钟配对IMU-运动样本），实验结果表明SAIP能有效处理不同体型的运动捕捉任务。

Conclusion: SAIP通过考虑身体形状差异，解决了现有惯性运动捕捉方法在体型泛化方面的局限性，为不同体型个体的运动捕捉提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion capture with sparse inertial sensors has gained significant
attention recently. However, existing methods almost exclusively rely on a
template adult body shape to model the training data, which poses challenges
when generalizing to individuals with largely different body shapes (such as a
child). This is primarily due to the variation in IMU-measured acceleration
caused by changes in body shape. To fill this gap, we propose Shape-aware
Inertial Poser (SAIP), the first solution considering body shape differences in
sparse inertial-based motion capture. Specifically, we decompose the sensor
measurements related to shape and pose in order to effectively model their
joint correlations. Firstly, we train a regression model to transfer the
IMU-measured accelerations of a real body to match the template adult body
model, compensating for the shape-related sensor measurements. Then, we can
easily follow the state-of-the-art methods to estimate the full body motions of
the template-shaped body. Finally, we utilize a second regression model to map
the joint velocities back to the real body, combined with a shape-aware
physical optimization strategy to calculate global motions on the subject.
Furthermore, our method relies on body shape awareness, introducing the first
inertial shape estimation scheme. This is accomplished by modeling the
shape-conditioned IMU-pose correlation using an MLP-based network. To validate
the effectiveness of SAIP, we also present the first IMU motion capture dataset
containing individuals of different body sizes. This dataset features 10
children and 10 adults, with heights ranging from 110 cm to 190 cm, and a total
of 400 minutes of paired IMU-Motion samples. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that SAIP can effectively handle motion capture tasks for diverse
body shapes. The code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Lean搜索引擎主要依赖形式化语句的非正式翻译，忽视了与现实用户查询的匹配问题，导致定理证明进展缓慢且费力。

Method: 分析并聚类公开Lean讨论的语义，在模拟用户意图的合成查询上微调文本嵌入，使用多样化反馈信号对齐数学家偏好。

Result: 在真实世界查询、非正式化语句和证明状态上的评估显示，相比之前搜索引擎和GPT-4o，实现了超过30%的相对改进。

Conclusion: Lean Finder是一个用户中心的语义搜索引擎，与基于LLM的定理证明器兼容，桥接了检索与形式推理。

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that
understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal
theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant
theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making
advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though
helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of
the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world
user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored
to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering
the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on
synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder
with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it
with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on
real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that
our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous
search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with
LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean

TL;DR: LS-OGD是一个用于多模态学习的自适应控制框架，通过动态调整学习率和模态融合权重来应对概念漂移，确保系统在漂移条件下的稳定性和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习系统在非平稳环境中容易受到概念漂移的影响，特别是模态特定的漂移和缺乏持续自适应机制会降低系统性能。

Method: 使用在线控制器动态调整模型学习率和不同数据模态的融合权重，响应检测到的漂移和预测误差变化。

Result: 在有限漂移条件下，LS-OGD系统的预测误差是均匀最终有界的，如果漂移停止则收敛到零；自适应融合策略能有效隔离和缓解严重模态特定漂移的影响。

Conclusion: 为开发可靠且持续自适应的多模态学习系统建立了理论基础，确保系统韧性和容错能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due
to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance.
Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable
adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel
adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of
concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the
model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities
in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that
under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is
uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively
isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby
ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees
establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously
adapting multimodal learning systems.

Motivation: 多响应采样能提高LLM输出质量，但计算成本高昂。关键挑战是如何在准确性和效率之间平衡，决定何时停止生成新样本。

Method: 基于序贯搜索和贝叶斯学习，BEACON顺序生成响应，实时更新奖励分布的后验信念，当进一步探索的边际效用不再值得计算成本时停止采样。

Result: BEACON将平均采样次数减少高达80%，同时保持响应质量。在成本高效的偏好数据生成方面也表现出实用性。

Conclusion: BEACON提供了理论最优性保证和实际可行性，为未来研究者提供了实用的自适应采样解决方案。

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality,
but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is
deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against
efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive
Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework
grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially
generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward
distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to
stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates
once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the
expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical
tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up
to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's
utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical
extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

Motivation: 现有检测方法（包括基于MLLM的技术）在处理表情包中通过讽刺和隐喻等微妙修辞手法表达的隐性有害内容时经常出现误判。

Method: 构建知识库，将每个表情包解构为误判风险模式，解释其可能被误判的原因；对于目标表情包，检索相关模式并动态指导MLLM的推理。

Result: 在5个有害检测任务的6,626个表情包基准测试中，PatMD优于最先进的基线方法，F1分数平均提高8.30%，准确率提高7.71%。

Conclusion: PatMD展示了强大的泛化能力和改进的有害表情包检测能力，通过主动缓解误判风险有效提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are
increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical
devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including
MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to
frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that
improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating
these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial
content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk
patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We
first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a
misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either
overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign
content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant
patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning.
Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show
that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of
8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy,
demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of
harmful memes.

Motivation: 传统依赖专家视觉审查的EEG信号分类方法因记录复杂性和数量增加而变得不切实际，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 基于WaveNet架构，利用扩张因果卷积和残差连接处理EEG数据，采用70/20/10的数据分割进行训练、验证和测试。

Result: 模型分类准确率超过之前的CNN和LSTM方法，在噪声和伪影分类上精度高，但在生理和病理信号间存在可解释的误分类。

Conclusion: WaveNet架构适合EEG数据分析，能捕捉细粒度和长程时间依赖性，为EEG信号自动分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to
automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological,
artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal
classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly
impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings.
Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St.
Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and
tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a
classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and
was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline.
Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision,
although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification
between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical
overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis,
is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and
residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range
temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline,
including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support
model generalization.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over
10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early
diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and
limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable
biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves
three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets,
extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the
comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art
deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal
windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an
intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth,
independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent
and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance,
with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal
convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation,
outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These
findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital
biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and
continuous monitoring.

Abstract: As wildfires become increasingly destructive and expensive to control,
effective management of active wildfires requires accurate, real-time fire
spread predictions. To enhance the forecasting accuracy of active fires, data
assimilation plays a vital role by integrating observations (such as
remote-sensing data) and fire predictions generated from numerical models. This
paper provides a comprehensive investigation on the application of a recently
proposed diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm -- the Ensemble Score Filter
(EnSF) -- to the data assimilation problem for real-time active wildfire spread
predictions. Leveraging a score-based generative diffusion model, EnSF has been
shown to have superior accuracy for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering
problems, making it an ideal candidate for the filtering problems of wildfire
spread models. Technical details are provided, and our numerical investigations

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLMs处理工具返回的复杂JSON响应的能力，发现即使是最先进的模型在处理结构化响应时仍存在困难，不同处理策略的性能差异可达3%-50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实任务自动化中，LLMs需要调用工具并处理复杂的JSON响应，但LLMs处理结构化响应的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 创建了专门的数据集，评估了15个开源和闭源模型，采用多种提示策略进行测试。

Result: JSON处理对所有前沿模型都是困难任务，最佳处理策略取决于工具输出的性质和大小以及所需推理的复杂性。

Conclusion: LLMs处理工具JSON响应的能力仍有待提升，处理策略的选择对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: Most realistic task automation problems require large language models (LLMs)
to call tools, which often return complex JSON responses. These responses must
be further processed to derive the information necessary for task completion.
The ability of LLMs to do so is under-studied. In this paper, we study the tool
response processing task and LLMs' abilities to process structured (JSON)
responses. We created a dataset for this task, and evaluated 15 open and closed
weight models using multiple prompting approaches. Our results show that JSON
processing remains a difficult task even for frontier models across multiple
prompting strategies. The optimal response processing strategy depends on both
the nature and size of the tool outputs, as well as the complexity of the
required reasoning. Variations in processing approaches can lead to performance
differences ranging from 3\% to 50\%.

Motivation: 推动可持续能源和废物管理策略，探索未充分利用生物质资源在可持续氢生产中的应用潜力，提高热解过程建模精度和优化效率。

Method: 对纯枣核、废咖啡渣及其混合物进行理化分析，包括工业分析、元素分析、热重分析、动力学和热力学分析等，并采用LSTM模型进行热重曲线预测。

Result: 混合物3具有最高的氢气产率潜力但活化能最高，混合物1具有最佳的活化能值，KAS方法被确定为最准确的动力学模型，LSTM模型预测热重曲线精度极高。

Conclusion: 人工智能在热解过程建模中表现出色，未充分利用生物质资源具有可持续制氢潜力，混合比例对热解性能有显著影响。

Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management
strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass
through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main
objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such
as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen
production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while
evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends.
Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC
analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS
- 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential
but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1
exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic
modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS
as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the
pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial
intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA
curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).

TL;DR: 提出LAMI框架，通过图-语言联合建模检测青少年非法药物使用并解释行为风险因素，在YRBS和NSDUH数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建模方法将调查变量独立处理，忽视了变量间的潜在关联结构，需要开发能捕捉变量间潜在关系并提供解释的方法。

Method: LAMI框架将个体响应表示为关系图，通过专门的图结构学习层学习潜在连接，并集成大语言模型生成基于图结构和调查语义的自然语言解释。

Result: 在YRBS和NSDUH数据集上，LAMI在预测准确性上优于竞争基线方法，并能揭示有意义的行为子结构和心理社会路径。

Conclusion: LAMI能够有效检测青少年非法药物使用，同时提供与已知风险因素一致的行为解释，为公共卫生干预提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing
public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health
and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze
large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich
demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use.
However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently,
overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this
limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal
Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for
detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs.
LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent
connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and
integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations
grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS
and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in
predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI
reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as
family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with
established risk factors for substance use.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTR-LoRA是一个基于曲率信任区域的参数高效微调框架，通过秩调度和稳定性感知优化，在多个7B-13B模型上实现了比现有PEFT方法更好的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PEFT方法虽然通过低秩更新、量化或启发式预算分配来提高效率，但往往将容量分配与训练过程中的更新演变分离开来，缺乏原则性的优化指导。

Method: CTR-LoRA框架基于曲率信任区域，通过轻量级二阶代理计算边际效用来分配参数，并使用Fisher/Hessian度量信任区域来约束更新，结合秩调度和稳定性感知优化。

Result: 在多个开源骨干模型(7B-13B)上，无论是分布内还是分布外基准测试，都显示出对强PEFT基线的持续改进，提高了准确性、训练稳定性，减少了内存需求并实现了更高的吞吐量。

Conclusion: CTR-LoRA在性能和效率的帕累托边界上表现出色，为更稳健和可部署的PEFT提供了一条原则性路径。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for
adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets.
Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates,
quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the
allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this
work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that
integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA
allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight
second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust
region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent
improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy,
CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves
higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and
efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and
deployable PEFT.

Motivation: 参数高效微调(PEFT)技术虽然重要，但其效率低下在时间和成本方面带来显著挑战，特别是未充分解决的Shadowy Sparsity问题阻碍了加速。

Method: Long Exposure系统包含三个组件：Shadowy-sparsity Exposer使用长感知范围捕获稀疏性细节；Sequence-oriented Predictor处理大序列输入和动态参数；Dynamic-aware Operator优化计算模式和内存访问。

Result: 广泛评估显示，Long Exposure在端到端微调中实现了最高2.49倍的加速，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Long Exposure为加速LLMs的PEFT提供了有前景的进展，有效解决了Shadowy Sparsity带来的效率问题。

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse
downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications.
However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques
presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational
costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed
Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been
adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long
Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure
comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged
sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity;
Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to
handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and
Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and
coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive
evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a
$2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements
in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型推理模型通过链式思维推理展示出强大的多步问题解决能力，但这种迭代思维机制引入了新的安全漏洞面。

Method: 采用对抗嵌入训练和反向门植入策略，通过优化嵌入鼓励模型在推理步骤后生成过渡性标记，从而诱导永久推理循环。

Result: 在四个先进LRM和三个数学推理基准测试中实现100%攻击成功率，迫使模型生成达到最大标记限制。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了大型推理模型在推理效率方面的关键且未被充分探索的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step
problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative
thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the
Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative
control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual
reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional
tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from
concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the
continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial
embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we
introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation
through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate
across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three
math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token
limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility
loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies
trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and
underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning
(in)efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中联邦学习面临新客户持续加入的开放环境，现有方法在知识发现粒度、源域性能保持和适应效率方面存在不足。

Method: 将模型分为编码器和分类器，利用编码器对域偏移敏感、分类器对类别增量敏感的特性，开发细粒度知识发现、贡献驱动聚合和抗遗忘机制。

Result: 在三种典型数据偏移场景的多域数据集实验中，Gains在源域和目标域客户端性能上均显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: Gains通过细粒度知识发现和平衡适应机制，有效解决了开放环境下联邦学习的知识发现和适应问题。

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed
total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL
process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two
critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and
integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing
research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices
source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a
fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains
splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing
features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while
classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we
develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation
techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an
anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance,
ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets
across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly
outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and
target-domain clients. Code is available at:

Conclusion: SAU-FNO是先进3D IC热模拟的高效工具，平衡了精度和计算效率。

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power
densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow
for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster
alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity
data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator
(SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to
capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features
effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data,
minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up
training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art
thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM
methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

Abstract: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and
expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with
linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We
introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task
by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each
nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly
instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity
pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision
variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model
equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a
dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the
established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our
approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents
can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational
modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

Abstract: High-quality training data is the foundation of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, shaping how models learn and perform. Although much is
known about what types of data are effective for training, the impact of the
data's geometric structure on model performance remains largely underexplored.
We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of
redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To
investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features
from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify
diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent
homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that
drives AI systems.

Motivation: 大语言模型存在产生误导或虚构信息的幻觉问题，而幻觉检测面临标注数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 提出PALE框架，利用提示引导从LLMs生成真实和幻觉数据作为增强，并引入对比马氏距离评分来评估嵌入空间的真实性。

Result: 实验表明PALE在幻觉检测上表现优异，显著优于竞争基线方法6.55%。

Conclusion: PALE提供了一种无需人工标注、具有强泛化性和实用性的幻觉检测解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI
community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been
found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as
hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to
ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in
hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing
both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce
Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework
that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for
hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and
hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more
effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings
produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive
Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions
of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a
matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying
structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require
additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality
for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE
achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the
competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

Motivation: 传统AI天气预测方法依赖再分析数据，存在数据同化偏差和时间不一致性问题。观测预测作为变革性范式，需要解决不规则高分辨率观测数据中学习跨不同测量系统的时空动态这一关键挑战。

Method: 使用掩码多模态自编码器(MMAE)进行数据同化，通过掩码ViT-VAE编码不规则卫星观测标记。AIWP采用时空解耦变压器和跨区域边界条件(CBC)，在观测空间中学习动态，实现基于子图像的全球观测预测。

Conclusion: DAWP框架通过AIDA模块使AIWP能够在完整的观测空间中运行，解决了传统再分析数据依赖的问题，为基于观测的天气预报提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive
progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction
(AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data
limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and
temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation
forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of
the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal
dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution
observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this
end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate
in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial
intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module
applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular
satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a
spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning
(CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based
global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA
initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP.
Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in
global precipitation forecasting.

Conclusion: Cog-Rethinker通过层次化元认知方法有效解决了LLM推理中的采样效率问题，为弱语言模型的推理能力提升提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable
inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable
reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models.
Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous
works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt
templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for
weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during
accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples.
To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical
metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses
on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our
Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive
two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems,
firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems
to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in
previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by
referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two
new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt
templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using
correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental
results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample
efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: AMiD框架通过系统化的辅助分布设计，有效解决了LLM知识蒸馏中的关键挑战，为未来的研究提供了统一的理论基础。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs.
Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from
a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous
studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and
training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the
high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome
these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating
assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals
of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic
investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes
$\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of
assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a
unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture
assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant
distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which
has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the
family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on
optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training
stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脓毒症是ICU中死亡率高的危重感染综合征，早期准确预测对及时干预至关重要。现有AI方法难以捕捉微弱的早期时间信号。

Method: 使用多内源视图表示增强机制构建丰富特征视图，结合级联双卷积时间序列注意力模块进行多尺度时间表征学习。

Result: MEET-Sepsis框架仅需SOTA方法20%的ICU监测时间即可达到竞争性预测准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架显著推进了早期脓毒症预测，广泛验证证实了其有效性。

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening infectious syndrome associated with high
mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Early and accurate sepsis prediction
(SP) is critical for timely intervention, yet remains challenging due to subtle
early manifestations and rapidly escalating mortality. While AI has improved SP
efficiency, existing methods struggle to capture weak early temporal signals.
This paper introduces a Multi-Endogenous-view Representation Enhancement (MERE)
mechanism to construct enriched feature views, coupled with a Cascaded
Dual-convolution Time-series Attention (CDTA) module for multi-scale temporal
representation learning. The proposed MEET-Sepsis framework achieves
competitive prediction accuracy using only 20% of the ICU monitoring time
required by SOTA methods, significantly advancing early SP. Extensive
validation confirms its efficacy. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个框架来追踪和引导大语言模型中的算法原语，揭示了推理过程由可组合的算法原语构成，这些原语可以通过向量操作在激活空间中进行几何组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何通过潜在计算和推理时间计算解决多步推理问题，探索模型内部的算法原语如何支持复杂推理任务。

Method: 通过聚类神经激活并将其与推理轨迹匹配来操作化算法原语，使用函数向量方法推导可重用的原语向量，并通过在残差流中注入原语来评估其对推理步骤和任务性能的影响。

Result: 在TSP、3SAT、AIME和图导航四个基准测试中，发现了跨任务和跨模型共享及任务特定的算法原语。推理微调后的模型表现出更系统的验证和路径生成原语使用，且原语向量可以在基础模型中诱导出推理微调模型的行为特征。

Conclusion: LLMs的推理可能由算法原语的组合几何结构支持，这些原语可以跨任务和跨模型迁移，推理微调能够增强跨领域的算法泛化能力。

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models
(LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and
steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach
links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates
algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring
their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four
benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph
navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and
labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods
to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of
reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and
scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task
and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both
shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its
reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after
finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and
path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in
Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning.
Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by
a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer
cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens
algorithmic generalization across domains.

*Kangqi Ni,Zhen Tan,Zijie Liu,Pingzhi Li,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO算法驱动的RLVR方法在提升LLM推理能力时存在不一致性，本文从数据分布角度分析其边界条件，证明GRPO本质上是保守的重加权方案，只能强化预训练偏见而非发现全新解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在不同推理领域的效果不一致，有时在数学领域显著提升但在医学领域停滞不前，这引发了对GRPO改进推理和泛化能力的边界条件的研究需求。

Method: 从理论证明GRPO是受限于基础模型分布的保守重加权方案，并通过从零开始训练transformer的受控实验，评估在推理深度、输入长度、token表示和组合性等方面的泛化能力。

Result: GRPO的OOD改进仅在目标任务与模型预训练偏见一致时出现，而ID任务的收益随着性能饱和而减少，表明GRPO无法超越预训练基础。

Conclusion: GRPO应被重新定义为强化预训练偏见的工具而非通用推理增强器，这推动了开发能够超越预训练基础的新算法的需求。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by
the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach
for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model
may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet
remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a
critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and
generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data
distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a
conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and
thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in
carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,
evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token
representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled
explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target
task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution
(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a
universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.
Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a
model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

Conclusion: Stratos展示了在垂直领域LLM部署中的潜力，能够自动化蒸馏流程并优化云资源使用。

Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large
language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks
and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and
budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer
technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation
frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex
user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos,
an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model
selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud
environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system
budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically
matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task
complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a
student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher
baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse
synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency
and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for
vertical-domain LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来监测和量化AI系统中的分布偏移问题，并展示了KS距离如何用于衡量分布偏移对AI智能体性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习系统中测试数据分布与训练数据分布不一致的问题，这种分布偏移会导致预测误差，在安全关键应用中尤其危险。

Method: 采用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来测量分布偏移，使用KS距离来量化分布偏移程度及其对AI智能体性能的影响。

Result: 研究表明即使KS距离仅为0.02，也会导致强化学习智能体在单个交叉路口的旅行时间增加约50%，影响显著。

Conclusion: KS检验和KS距离可作为有价值的统计工具，用于实时监测AI智能体的性能退化，帮助AI系统更有效地应对分布偏移问题。

Abstract: One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test
data in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability
distribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an
ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome
and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML
systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be
critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal
with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability
distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this
deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance
can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's
performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable
statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More
specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about
50\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement
Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test
and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step
forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and
this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a
more informed manner.

Conclusion: 提出的多截止值自适应策略显著提升了ANaGRAM的性能，谱理论框架为正则化的必要性提供了理论依据，并扩展了与格林函数理论的联系。

Abstract: Recent works have shown that natural gradient methods can significantly
outperform standard optimizers when training physics-informed neural networks

with ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired approach employing singular value
decomposition with cutoff regularization. Building on this analysis, we propose
a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance.
Experiments on benchmark PDEs validate the effectiveness of our method, which
allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical
grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the
necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's
functions theory.

Motivation: 传统数据影响评估方法主要关注收敛模型上的静态影响，忽视了深度模型优化过程中样本影响的动态变化特性，且频繁计算影响估计的计算负担过重。

Method: 开发了层感知在线估计器，仅需损失对输出的梯度，避免了参数级和全网络梯度计算，同时保持了排序保真度。

Result: 在LLM预训练、微调和图像分类等任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在显著降低时间和内存成本的同时提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法使动态数据筛选在实际应用中变得高效且可扩展，为数据为中心的学习提供了实用的动态影响评估工具。

Abstract: Data-centric learning emphasizes curating high-quality training samples to
boost performance rather than designing new architectures. A central problem is
to estimate the influence of training sample efficiently. Prior studies largely
focus on static influence measured on a converged model, overlooking how data
valuation dynamically changes during optimization. This omission neglects the
dynamic nature of sample influence during optimization, especially in deep
models. To address the computational burden of frequent influence estimation,
we develop a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output
gradients. This design avoids parameter-level and full-network gradients while
preserving ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining,
fine-tuning, and image classification show our method improves accuracy with
substantially lower time and memory cost, making dynamic data curation
efficient and scalable in practice.

Conclusion: STAR通过专门处理状态变量的分类特性，有效解决了现有时间序列基础模型在建模状态变量时的局限性，显著提升了异常检测性能。

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), however, in
real-world industrial scenarios, many time series comprise not only numerical
variables such as temperature and flow, but also numerous discrete state
variables that describe the system status, such as valve on/off or day of the
week. Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state
variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them
uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach
prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a
significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are
integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel
STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance
the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the
fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We
design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex
categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2)
We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates
low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby
flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model.
(3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively
detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve
the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.

Conclusion: 提出的决策导向框架通过端到端优化传感器部署和预测模型，显著提升了洪水应急决策的及时性和可靠性。

Abstract: Timely and reliable decision-making is vital for flood emergency response,
yet it remains severely hindered by limited and imprecise situational awareness
due to various budget and data accessibility constraints. Traditional flood
management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote
sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take
flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these
approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where
to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train
flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but
overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors
may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel
decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ
sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to
optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline
integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable
sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood
reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer
tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the
incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable
gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic
decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained
disaster response tasks.

Conclusion: 渐进神经网络为稳健、可扩展且计算高效的流动控制提供了有前景的迁移学习框架，即使在源和目标环境差异显著时仍保持有效性。

Abstract: This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows.
Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve
and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the
context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of
conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance,
convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how
knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments,
can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic
evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is
highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting.
In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior
knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to
overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis
further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from
the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target
task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target
environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical
regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in
suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results
highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust,
scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be
applied to more complex flow configurations.

Abstract: Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of
designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces
AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil
optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM
selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database,
which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most
increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 \%
of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the
performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In
multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence
and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the
previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are
discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances.
Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement
learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to
conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential
of DbM in machine learning-driven design.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and
short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to
adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and
reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning
(RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into
the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The
problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances
trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained
on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy
consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios.
Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and
transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of
market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results
indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and
operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV
producers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现大型语言模型在代码领域的监督微调中存在记忆化障碍问题，即模型对下游代码数据的强记忆化会阻碍优化过程，使其无法有效获取新的、可泛化的代码知识。

Method: 提出IB-FT方法，在代码数据的隐藏表示上应用信息瓶颈惩罚，压缩虚假的记忆化特征，同时保留任务相关信息。

Result: 在两个代码基准测试(OriGen和Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)上的实验表明，IB-FT显著缓解了记忆化障碍，提高了top-1性能(Pass@1)，并在更严格的多样本度量Pass@k(m)下获得了更稳定的增益。

Conclusion: IB-FT方法能够有效克服代码生成中的记忆化障碍，相比传统微调方法在性能稳定性和泛化能力方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to code domains via
supervised fine-tuning (FT) has been commonly used for code generation.
However, we identify a previously underappreciated failure mode, the
memorization barrier, where strong memorization of downstream code data in the
base model could trap optimization and prevent the standard FT from effectively
acquiring new, generalizable code knowledge. To overcome this barrier, we
propose the information bottleneck (IB)-guided fine-tuning, termed IB-FT, which
applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of the code data to compress
spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.
Extensive experiments on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)
show that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves
top-1 performance (Pass@$1$), and yields far more stable gains under the
stricter multi-sample metric Pass@$k^{(m)}$ (a problem counts as solved only if
at least $m$ of $k$ samples pass unit tests) compared with conventional FT.

TL;DR: PolyConFM是首个聚合物基础模型，通过构象中心的生成预训练统一聚合物建模和设计，解决了现有方法忽视聚合物构象全局结构信息的问题。


<details>

Conclusion: PolyConFM为聚合物科学提供了通用且强大的工具，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin
countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep
learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the
whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global
structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately
limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a
universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream
tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we
introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer
modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining.
Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of
local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM
under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local
conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating
their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer
conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation
dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby
enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that
PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on
diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and
powerful tool.

sources, and used to train taskspecific causal models from which individual
causal effects can be estimated. We summarize the findings of the two
real-world applications of the approach to date as a demonstration of its
versatility and utility for medical discovery at scale.

Result: 在社交机器人检测数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架能有效削弱GNN检测器的性能。

Conclusion: RoBCtrl是首个针对GNN社交机器人检测器的对抗攻击框架，成功证明了现有检测方法的脆弱性。

Abstract: Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for
individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered
considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous
detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these
detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited
control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the
heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the
first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot
control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.
Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts
by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby
evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving
social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social
accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then
employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the
attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a
hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to
accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot
detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the
performance of GNN-based detectors.

TL;DR: GCQ是一种受大脑启发的网格状编码量化方法，通过吸引子动力学将观察-动作序列压缩为离散表示，实现时空联合压缩和统一世界建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量量化方法处理静态输入，无法有效压缩时空序列。受神经系统中网格状编码的启发，需要开发能够联合压缩空间和时间的方法。

Method: 使用动作条件化码本，其中码字来自连续吸引子神经网络，并根据动作动态选择，实现时空压缩。

Result: 实验表明GCQ在多种任务中都能有效进行紧凑编码，并支持长时程预测、目标导向规划和逆向建模。

Conclusion: GCQ不仅为高效序列建模提供了计算工具，也为神经系统中网格状编码的形成提供了理论视角。

Abstract: We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for
compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using
grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector
quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs
spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where
codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically
selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time,
serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports
long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact
encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool
for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation
of grid-like codes in neural systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMS-Quant是一种新的浮点量化方法，通过尾数位共享和自适应搜索技术，首次将量化位宽扩展到非整数位宽(如FP5.33、FP4.25)，在保持精度的同时显著加速大语言模型推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的巨大参数量带来了存储和推理效率瓶颈，现有量化方法主要关注整数位宽，需要探索更精细的非整数位宽量化来接近量化最优解。

Method: 提出两种核心技术：1) 尾数位共享 - 将k个量化权重分组共享最低有效尾数位；2) 自适应搜索 - 采用离线优化策略最小化共享带来的精度损失。同时实现了高效的CUDA线性核函数。

Result: 实验表明，AMS-Quant可将模型量化为FP5.33-e2m3和FP4.25-e2m2格式，相比FP16推理分别实现2.8倍和3.2倍的解码加速，且精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: AMS-Quant首次实现了非整数位宽的浮点量化，通过创新的尾数位共享和自适应搜索技术，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring
storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly
floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM
inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference
process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization
exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant,
to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two
novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing,
which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant
mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization
bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which
employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation
introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA
Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency
reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale
datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3
and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16
inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of operating complex graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) have the potential to transform desktop automation. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI
understanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments
remains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual
annotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We
introduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically
explores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical
data collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS -
an ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many
of its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability.
GUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into
hierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve
comprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla
crawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of
27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each
annotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility
metadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning
LLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on
downstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro
benchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source
library for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along
with the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold
benchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy.

Motivation: 随着城市化进程加快，交通拥堵问题日益严重，需要可靠且响应迅速的交通预测模型来支持智能交通系统建设，改善城市资源分配和出行体验。

Method: 论文回顾了基于图神经网络的主流交通预测方法，包括STGCN、GraphWaveNet、STWave和D2STGNN等模型，这些方法结合了复杂的图卷积结构和时间建模机制。同时分析了早期基于人工特征工程的事件信息处理方法。

Result: 现有GNN方法在标准交通数据集上表现出色，特别擅长捕捉具有周期性规律的交通模式。但早期事件处理方法依赖领域专家知识，难以泛化到复杂未知事件，且人工特征容易丢失丰富的语义细节。

Conclusion: 虽然图神经网络在交通预测方面取得了显著进展，但在事件信息处理方面仍存在局限性，需要开发更有效的事件建模方法来提升模型的泛化能力和预测准确性。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and
improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has
intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting
models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can
effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and
dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models
such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including
STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic
datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional
structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular
effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by
periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored
various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied
on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced
manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for
different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat
enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy
reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse
and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often
lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has
generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of
applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive
performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored,
despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical
applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties
of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We
perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e.,
over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and
calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time
series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline
models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in
contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

Result: 该方法比替代数据驱动模型的RMSE降低达2倍，在仅有1%测量覆盖率时仍保持高精度。

Conclusion: 图神经网络有潜力为配电系统提供可扩展、可复现和数据驱动的电压监测方案。

Abstract: Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for
real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER
penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust
distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to
maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however,
struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting
their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph
neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both
electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low
observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the
public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of
buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower
RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as
little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs
to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for
distribution systems.

Result: 在57、118和2000节点系统上测试，相比传统AC OPF求解器，MSE降低约25%，可行性误差减少达3倍，运行时间加速达13倍，且在N-1故障下保持准确性。

Conclusion: 残差学习是线性近似与AC可行OPF之间的实用且可扩展的桥梁，可实现近实时运行决策。

Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major
computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we
propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC
OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections
required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a
topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC
feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC
power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-,
118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in
feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC
OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales
efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning
is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and
AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research
frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel
model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate
statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter
decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in
PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods
remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede
practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with
Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that
strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an
integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is
seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant
communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive
evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID
conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse
aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for
communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence
systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude
acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still
suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains
where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we
introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point
clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global
dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph
attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise
attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale
inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on
four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios
with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and
demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results
highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and
establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on
irregular domains.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the
underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled
early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of
the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed
distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we
demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed
structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides
guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two
consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed
dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong
alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring
and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

Abstract: This work introduces a post-training quantization (PTQ) method for dense

Frobenius distance between the theoretical output and the dequantized output
(before the activation function) as the objective, an explicit QUBO whose
binary variables represent the rounding choice for each weight and bias is
obtained. Additionally, by exploiting the structure of the coefficient QUBO
matrix, the global problem can be exactly decomposed into $n$ independent
subproblems of size $f+1$, which can be efficiently solved using some
heuristics such as simulated annealing. The approach is evaluated on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1
and compared with a round-to-nearest traditional quantization methodology.

Conclusion: BPL框架通过双重蒸馏策略成功解决了推荐系统偏差问题，在两种测试环境中都实现了高性能，平衡了用户长期满意度和平台后续行为预测的需求。

Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to
incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been
extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called
counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,
significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test
environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test
environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual
test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test
focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is
desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only
one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive
Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences
with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed
to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.
Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased
model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected
feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through
self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its
knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce
more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,
thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and
counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:

TL;DR: CONEC-LoRA提出了一种新的领域增量学习方法，通过任务共享和任务特定的LoRA整合、随机分类器和辅助网络来解决灾难性遗忘问题，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法创建任务特定的LoRAs，但忽视了跨任务的共享知识，且推理时任务特定LoRA选择不准确会导致精度显著下降，现有分类器泛化能力不足。

Method: 1. 整合任务共享LoRA和任务特定LoRA来提取共同知识和领域特定知识；2. 使用随机分类器增强正确分类可能性；3. 部署辅助网络预测任务特定LoRAs，采用不同深度网络结构，每层连接局部分类器利用中间表示；4. 集成球生成器损失和变换模块解决合成样本偏差问题。

Result: 在4个流行基准问题上，CONEC-LoRA相比现有方法取得了超过5%的优势。

Conclusion: CONEC-LoRA通过知识整合、随机分类器和辅助网络的有效设计，在领域增量学习问题上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that
aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic
forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared
knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during
inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely
on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization
powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank
adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed
from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and
task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing
approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose
parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of
correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed
to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the
concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is
connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate
representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and
transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our
rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in
4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

TL;DR: 提出PassREfinder-FL框架，通过图神经网络预测网站间的密码重用风险，使用联邦学习保护用户隐私，在真实数据集上达到0.9153的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密码重用检测方法通常限制密码创建或网站访问，影响可用性，且依赖复杂的账户共享机制，难以实际部署。

Method: 定义密码重用关系概念，构建网站图，使用图神经网络进行链接预测，结合联邦学习保护隐私，无需跨管理员共享用户敏感信息。

Result: 在包含3.6亿泄露账户、22,378个网站的真实数据集上，联邦学习设置下F1分数达到0.9153，比其他先进GNN模型性能提升4-11%。

Conclusion: PassREfinder-FL能有效预测网站间密码重用风险，生成可操作的风险评分，同时保护用户隐私，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who
frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has
attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login
attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password
creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing
mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we
propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing
risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --
defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and
represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),
we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between
sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by
incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as
nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a
federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user
sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset
of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that
PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further
validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over
other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we
demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse
likelihood as actionable risk scores.

Motivation: 反向传播算法在物理神经网络中难以实现，平衡传播(EP)作为替代方案具有原位训练潜力，但需要扩展到更广泛的物理系统。

Method: 将EP学习扩展到离散和连续复值波系统，在弱耗散条件下工作，使用可训练的局部势能而非节点间连接，在激子极化激元凝聚体中测试。

Result: 在标准基准测试（逻辑任务和手写数字识别）中表现出稳定收敛，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 为系统控制仅限于局部参数的物理系统提供了一条实用的原位学习路径。

Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial
intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural
networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable
efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to
both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to
previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative
regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even
without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be
replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative
exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical
task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence,
establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which
system control is restricted to local parameters.

<details>

Motivation: 现实应用中常因遮挡、隐私约束和设备故障导致模态缺失，而现有方法主要关注完整模态数据的交互融合，缺乏对模态缺失问题的处理，导致泛化能力差

Method: 1. 去冗余同质-异质分解模块：将模态分解为模态同质、模态异质和噪声表示；2. 分布对齐自蒸馏模块：利用双向知识转移完全恢复缺失语义

Result: 在两个数据集上的综合实验表明，FSRF在不确定模态缺失情况下相比先前方法具有显著性能优势

Conclusion: FSRF框架有效缓解了MSA任务中的模态缺失问题，提高了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research
hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding.
Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion
on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in
real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and
device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability.
  To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework
(FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task.
  Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization
module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous,
modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate
constraint paradigms for representation learning.
  Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that
fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge
transfer.
  Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a
significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing
modalities.

TL;DR: STABLE是一个门控持续自编辑框架，使用LoRA进行参数高效微调，通过三种指标评估编辑稳定性来约束顺序更新中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要持续适应机制，但顺序更新会导致灾难性遗忘，新编辑会降低先前获得的知识。

Method: 使用LoRA进行参数高效微调，通过三种指标（精确匹配下降、比特增加、KL散度）评估候选编辑的稳定性，超过阈值时重新缩放或拒绝LoRA更新。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，门控机制有效减轻遗忘同时保持适应性，基于EM的门控在短持续学习序列中实现最高累积性能。

Conclusion: 不同门控策略可实现相当的分布偏移但产生不同精度结果，突显门控设计在持续适应中的重要性，为持续模型编辑提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual
adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge.
This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that
constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine
tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate
edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i)
Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase,
reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying
distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is
exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected.
Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates
forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest
cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show
that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift
(measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes,
highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This
approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs
to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code:

Motivation: 多示例上下文学习虽然能提升任务性能，但增加了内存和计算成本。现有提示压缩方法对多示例压缩效果不佳，需要更有效的压缩方案。

Method: 提出MemCom分层压缩方法，使用更强的压缩器模型，在每个transformer层对多示例表示进行细粒度压缩。

Result: 在多个分类任务上，MemCom在所有压缩比下均优于基线方法，特别是在高压缩比时性能下降小于10%，而基线方法下降超过20-30%。

Conclusion: MemCom通过分层压缩机制有效解决了多示例上下文学习的效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了内存和计算开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different
tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples /
demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of
examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs
higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to
improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing
the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to
generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing
prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and
simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve
effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more
trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot
representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression
by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these
insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically
evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different
model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence
lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms
strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks
with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at
higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy
with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

Motivation: 探索是否能在顺序决策任务中通过自适应控制人类代理水平来实现人机互补，就像在分类任务中已经证明的那样。

Method: 使用预训练的AI代理将人类可采取的行动限制到一个子集，然后让人类从这个行动集中选择行动，并引入利用行动集平滑特性的bandit算法来优化人类代理水平。

Result: 在1600名参与者的大规模实验中，使用该系统的参与者比单独行动表现提升30%，比AI代理表现提升2%以上，尽管AI代理本身已大幅优于无支持的人类。

Conclusion: 通过限制行动选择范围的自适应决策支持系统能够在顺序决策任务中有效实现人机互补，显著提升整体决策性能。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, in classification tasks, it is possible to design
decision support systems that do not require human experts to understand when
to cede agency to a classifier or when to exercise their own agency to achieve
complementarity$\unicode{x2014}$experts using these systems make more accurate
predictions than those made by the experts or the classifier alone. The key
principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the
level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve
complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer
this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a
pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a
subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along
the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness
properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize
the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct
a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a
wildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported
by our system outperform those who play on their own by $\sim$$30$% and the AI
agent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely
outperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the
data gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source
implementation of our system at

Method: 使用相似性搜索和随机表示构建无训练的世界模型，通过对比PlaNet模型在潜在重建和图像相似性方面的表现进行评估。

Result: 搜索式世界模型在单步和长时程动态预测中与训练式模型表现相当，在长时程预测方面在视觉差异较大的环境中表现更优。

Conclusion: 基于搜索的世界模型是训练式世界模型的有效替代方案，尤其在长时程预测任务中具有优势。

Abstract: World Models have vastly permeated the field of Reinforcement Learning. Their
ability to model the transition dynamics of an environment have greatly
improved sample efficiency in online RL. Among them, the most notorious example
is Dreamer, a model that learns to act in a diverse set of image-based
environments. In this paper, we leverage similarity search and stochastic
representations to approximate a world model without a training procedure. We
establish a comparison with PlaNet, a well-established world model of the
Dreamer family. We evaluate the models on the quality of latent reconstruction
and on the perceived similarity of the reconstructed image, on both next-step
and long horizon dynamics prediction. The results of our study demonstrate that
a search-based world model is comparable to a training based one in both cases.
Notably, our model show stronger performance in long-horizon prediction with
respect to the baseline on a range of visually different environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Q-learning分析多基于固定策略或离策略采样，对时变学习策略（即同策略采样）的理论分析不足，特别是在最小探索假设下的有限时间收敛性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 采用基于泊松方程的精细分析方法，将马尔可夫噪声分解为鞅差分项和残差项，并通过敏感性分析控制时变策略下的残差项。

Result: 证明了期望Q值误差平方的收敛速率，样本复杂度为O(1/ε²)，发现同策略Q-learning探索较弱但具有利用优势，其策略会收敛到最优策略而非保持固定。

Conclusion: 同策略Q-learning在探索和利用之间存在权衡，所发展的分析工具可推广到其他具有快速时变学习策略的强化学习算法分析中。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first finite-time analysis of the Q-learning
algorithm under time-varying learning policies (i.e., on-policy sampling) with
minimal assumptions -- specifically, assuming only the existence of a policy
that induces an irreducible Markov chain over the state space. We establish a
last-iterate convergence rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
implying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for achieving
$\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty] \le \epsilon$, matching that of off-policy
Q-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We
also derive an explicit rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q^{\pi_k} - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
where $\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal
that on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy
counterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an
optimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our
theory.
  Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce
rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on
exploration presents significant analytical challenges. To address these
challenges, we employ a refined approach that leverages the Poisson equation to
decompose the Markovian noise corresponding to the lazy transition matrix into
a martingale-difference term and residual terms. To control the residual terms
under time inhomogeneity, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the Poisson
equation solution with respect to both the Q-function estimate and the learning
policy. These tools may further facilitate the analysis of general
reinforcement learning algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies
-- such as single-timescale actor--critic methods and learning-in-games
algorithms -- and are of independent interest.

Conclusion: NAMEx框架可扩展到大规模系统（如Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE），在零样本和微调设置中均有效

Abstract: Existing expert merging strategies for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE)
typically rely on input-dependent or input-independent averaging of expert
parameters, but often lack a principled weighting mechanism. In this work, we
reinterpret expert merging through the lens of game theory, revealing
cooperative and competitive dynamics among experts. Based on this perspective,
we introduce Nash Merging of Experts (NAMEx), a novel framework that
incorporates Nash Bargaining into the merging process, enabling more balanced
and efficient collaboration among experts. Additionally, we incorporate complex
momentum into NAMEx to accelerate expert propagation with theoretical
guarantees for convergence. Extensive experiments across language modelling,
text classification, image classification, and zero-shot robustness under data
corruption show that NAMEx consistently outperforms competing methods while
integrating seamlessly with popular MoE architectures. Finally, we demonstrate
NAMEx's scalability by applying it to large-scale systems, including
Qwen1.5-MoE (14B) and DeepSeek-MoE (16B), where it proves effective in both
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零阶优化方法优化平滑后的目标函数（扰动参数下的期望目标），而锐度感知最小化关注邻域内的最大损失以获得更平坦的最小值。本文旨在明确连接这两种方法。

Method: 提出指数倾斜目标，通过倾斜参数t在平均损失和最大损失公式之间平滑过渡，开发新的零阶算法来求解软SAM目标。

Result: 该方法在分类、多项选择题问答和语言生成等下游任务上，相比传统零阶基线实现了更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为SAM变体的无梯度和内存高效替代方案，在保持计算效率的同时提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a
smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under
randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the
loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the
largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.
In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding
objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting
objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the
max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft
SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise
characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.
Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient
alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to
vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including
classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

Abstract: Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent
challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works
have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the
prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear
what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever
modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still
competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In
this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential
basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made
at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based
predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state
representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular
observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)
observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state
using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous
time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on
next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can
indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers
compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal
hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational
overhead in the online deployment.

Abstract: Generative models have become significant assets in the exploration and

adoption of diverse architectures, a rigorous comparative evaluation of their
performance on materials datasets is lacking. In this work, we present a
systematic benchmark of three representative generative models- AtomGPT (a
transformer-based model), Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE),
and FlowMM (a Riemannian flow matching model). These models were trained to
reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two publicly available
superconductivity datasets- JARVIS Supercon 3D and DS A/B from the Alexandria
database. Performance was assessed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between predicted and reference distributions of lattice parameters, as well as
the mean absolute error (MAE) of individual lattice constants. For the computed
KLD and MAE scores, CDVAE performs most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, and
then FlowMM. All benchmarking code and model configurations will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/atombench_inverse.

### [255] [Alignment is Localized: A Causal Probe into Preference Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16167)
*Archie Chaudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过层间因果修补分析语言模型对齐过程，发现对齐主要发生在中间层，是一个方向性的低秩过程而非扩散的参数化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于人类反馈的强化学习(RLHF)已成为语言模型对齐的流行方法，但其内部工作机制仍不透明，需要系统分析偏好优化如何实现对齐。

Method: 在基础模型和调优模型之间应用层间因果修补，分析人类偏好对中的激活差异，并使用LASSO回归识别关键层。

Result: 对齐在空间上是局部化的：中间层激活编码了决定奖励一致行为的独特子空间，而早期和晚期层基本不受影响；只有少数层具有非零系数连接激活距离与奖励增益。

Conclusion: 基于人类偏好的语言模型对齐是一个方向性的低秩过程，而非扩散的参数化过程，这为理解模型对齐机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human
annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference
fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain
set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human
Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,
particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the
internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In
this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model
alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its
tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology
on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:
mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines
reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely
unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number
of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward
gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from
human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather
than diffuse and parameteric.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过嵌入旋转和尺度等变卷积层来增强CNN对抗鲁棒性的架构方法，无需对抗训练即可提高模型对对抗攻击的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练作为主要防御策略存在计算成本高且可能损害干净数据准确性的问题，需要探索更高效的架构方法来提升对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种对称感知架构：并行设计（独立处理标准和等变特征后融合）和级联设计（顺序应用等变操作），嵌入旋转和尺度等变卷积层。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和CIFAR-10C数据集上，模型在FGSM和PGD攻击下一致提高了对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力，且无需对抗训练。

Conclusion: 对称强制架构可作为数据增强防御的高效且有原则的替代方案，通过编码对称先验来促进更平滑的决策边界和更强的对抗攻击弹性。

Abstract: Adversarial examples reveal critical vulnerabilities in deep neural networks
by exploiting their sensitivity to imperceptible input perturbations. While
adversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs
significant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this
work, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by
embedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and
scale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
These layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured
transformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and
greater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two
symmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and
equivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that
applies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that
such models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield
tighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme
Value for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently
improve adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial
training. These findings underscore the potential of symmetry-enforcing
architectures as efficient and principled alternatives to data
augmentation-based defenses.

Motivation: 当前强化学习研究过度关注性能表现而忽视了对学习动态的理解，这可能导致在学术基准上过拟合，难以将技术迁移到新问题。

Method: 以Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)为例，说明即使被认为是"饱和"的基准测试，仍可有效用于发展对强化学习的理解。

Conclusion: 强化学习研究应停止仅关注智能体能力展示，更多关注科学理解，并更精确地定义基准测试与数学形式化之间的关系。

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement
learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at
performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the
community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often
at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.
Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic
benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult
to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly
diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at
improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:
(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent
capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of
reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our
benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular
Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a
benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be
effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the
deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于运行时监控语言(RML)的新型语言奖励机，能够处理非正则、非马尔可夫任务，解决了传统奖励机表达能力受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中的奖励函数通常被视为黑盒映射，缺乏解释性，而传统奖励机只能处理正则语言，无法表达计数或参数化条件等复杂行为。

Method: 利用RML的内置内存机制，构建语言奖励机来指定非正则、非马尔可夫任务的奖励函数。

Result: 实验证明该方法在表达能力上优于现有奖励机方法，在事件处理和任务规范方面具有灵活性优势。

Conclusion: 基于RML的语言奖励机扩展了强化学习中奖励函数的表达能力，能够处理更复杂的非正则行为。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification,
whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly
harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as
black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in
many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are
given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address
this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling
the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their
expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to
capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In
this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel
class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of
RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian
tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments,
highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task
specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了关系强化学习在结构假设上的局限性，提供了一种更通用的强化学习方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has experienced a second wind in the past decade.
While incredibly successful in images and videos, these systems still operate
within the realm of propositional tasks ignoring the inherent structure that
exists in the problem. Consequently, relational extensions (RRL) have been
developed for such structured problems that allow for effective generalization
to arbitrary number of objects. However, they inherently make strong
assumptions about the problem structure. We introduce a novel framework that
combines RRL with object-centric representation to handle both structured and
unstructured data. We enhance learning by allowing the system to actively query
the human expert for guidance by explicitly modeling the uncertainty over the
policy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency
of our proposed approach.

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个非平稳多臂老虎机问题，其中奖励取决于动作和潜在状态，状态由未知线性动力学控制。提出了探索-承诺算法，在探索阶段使用随机动作估计系统参数，在承诺阶段优化动作序列以获得长期奖励，实现了Õ(T^{2/3})的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动作影响状态动态的情况下，短期奖励与长期奖励之间的权衡问题。传统方法难以处理这种状态-动作相互依赖的复杂环境。

Method: 提出探索-承诺算法：探索阶段使用Rademacher随机动作估计线性动态系统的马尔可夫参数；承诺阶段利用估计参数设计优化动作序列。还提出了半定松弛和Goemans-Williamson舍入作为实用方法。

Result: 算法实现了Õ(T^{2/3})的遗憾上界，解决了从时间相关奖励中学习和设计长期最优动作序列两个关键挑战。

Conclusion: 该工作为非平稳强化学习中的状态-动作交互问题提供了理论保证和实用算法，将系统识别与动作序列优化相结合，为复杂环境中的决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions
and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially,
the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between
short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm
for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher
actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics,
which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the
algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence
for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges:
learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences
with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing
near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using
bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence
with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard
problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our
regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with
Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集中的标签噪声会影响模型训练和验证，而现有检测方法缺乏统一评估标准，需要系统性的比较来指导方法选择。

Method: 将标签噪声检测方法分解为三个组件：标签一致性函数、聚合方法和信息收集方式（样本内vs样本外），提出统一基准任务和新的评估指标。

Result: 研究发现，使用对数边际作为标签一致性函数、平均概率聚合和样本内信息收集的组合在大多数场景下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计新的检测方法和为特定应用选择技术提供了实用指导，识别出了在不同噪声条件下表现稳健的最佳组件组合。

Abstract: Label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, affecting both model
training and validation. Clean data are essential for achieving strong
performance and ensuring reliable evaluation. While various techniques have
been proposed to detect noisy labels, there is no clear consensus on optimal
approaches. We perform a comprehensive benchmark of detection methods by
decomposing them into three fundamental components: label agreement function,
aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs
out-of-sample). This decomposition can be applied to many existing detection
methods, and enables systematic comparison across diverse approaches. To fairly
compare methods, we propose a unified benchmark task, detecting a fraction of
training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate. We also introduce a novel
metric: the false negative rate at this fixed operating point. Our evaluation
spans vision and tabular datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise
conditions. We identify that in-sample information gathering using average
probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement
function achieves the best results across most scenarios. Our findings provide
practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques
for specific applications.

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts.
This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the
progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on
policies within the European Green Deal. We present a dataset of 165 policies,
incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression
status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and
ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on
predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other
approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance
with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods
from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording
and metadata including political party and country representation. These
findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy

Conclusion: 一比特权重压缩在理论上可行且在实践中有效，为神经网络压缩提供了理论依据和实用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant computational and
memory demands, spurring interest in one-bit weight compression to enable
efficient inference on resource-constrained devices. However, the theoretical
underpinnings of such compression remain poorly understood. We address this gap
by analyzing one-bit quantization in the Random Features model, a simplified
framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We
prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last
incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random
features model. Our findings offer theoretical insights into neural network
compression. We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit quantization leads to
significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop
GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an
asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random
Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related
literature.

Conclusion: WEBSERV提供了一个高效可扩展的RL Web代理训练环境，解决了现有环境的局限性，为大规模Web交互任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained
increasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples
realistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side
state at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more
of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy
context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI
or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers
effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that
includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context
and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching
and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We
evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving
state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by
~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling
200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

Method: 使用神经常微分方程（Neural ODE）参数化Evoformer，保留核心注意力操作，通过伴随方法实现恒定内存成本，使用自适应ODE求解器平衡运行时间和精度。

Conclusion: 连续深度模型为生物分子建模提供了轻量级、可解释的替代方案，为高效自适应蛋白质结构预测框架开辟新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have
demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for
capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation.
However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces
high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth
formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural
ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This
continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the
adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and
accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure
prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces
structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary
structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate
the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this
performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on
a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a
lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work
opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction
frameworks.

Abstract: Despite the promising results of disentangled representation learning in
discovering latent patterns in graph-structured data, few studies have explored
disentanglement for hypergraph-structured data. Integrating hyperedge
disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage
hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that
are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge
disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel
criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our
proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed
criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in
genetic pathways (hyperedges).

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by
large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and
real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value
Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight
matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition
introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the
SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction
in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach
by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a
highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely
solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy
improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time
deployment on resource-constrained devices. We open source our code at

Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery
that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially
bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class
imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active
molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify
structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce
ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through
three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data
conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a
graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore
the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling
algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with
underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used
to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module
with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that
improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of
molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general
performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive
computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug
against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple
evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this
work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging
generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for
extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled
information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected
graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental
and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and
recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that
emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for
directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain
perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic
Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From
the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation
strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological
dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views,
S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more
general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7
real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach,
achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and
4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了记忆化与简单组合能力之间的协同作用，表明记忆化长尾特征与组合能力结合可以帮助模型对未见过的长尾特征组合做出正确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考深度学习中的记忆化与泛化关系，研究记忆化如何通过与组合能力结合来帮助模型处理训练数据中未出现的长尾特征组合。

Method: 理论分析线性设置中记忆化与组合的协同作用，并在神经网络架构上进行实验验证理论见解。

Result: 在线性设置中，记忆化与组合能力结合确实能帮助模型对罕见测试样本做出正确预测；实验表明该理论见解适用于非线性设置，且模型组合能力依赖于架构设计。

Conclusion: 记忆化与组合能力之间存在协同效应，这种效应可以帮助模型泛化到未见过的长尾特征组合，模型架构对组合能力有重要影响。

Abstract: Deep learning has led researchers to rethink the relationship between
memorization and generalization. In many settings, memorization does not hurt
generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing
long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between
memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction
on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a
linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make
correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of
long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the
training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show
that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further
observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its
architecture.

TL;DR: 提出了MGTS-Net，一种用于时间序列预测的多模态图增强网络，通过优化特征提取、构建异质图融合多模态信息以及动态加权多尺度预测，解决了现有方法在细粒度时序模式提取、多模态信息融合和动态多尺度特征适应方面的挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的方法验证了其优越性，MGTS-Net通过创新的多模态图增强架构有效解决了多模态时间序列预测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating
multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of
such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of
fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal
information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To
address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced
Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core
components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes
feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and
textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a
Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph
to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment
relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a
Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by
dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and
long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits
excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with
other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior
performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.

Motivation: 将数据分布的先验信息直接整合到Transformer架构中，以改进经典基于流的模型在优化问题凸性和稀疏性方面的不足。

Method: 基于正则化Wasserstein近端算子的稀疏Transformer架构设计，该算子具有闭式解且表现为Transformer的特殊表示形式。

Result: 在生成建模和贝叶斯逆问题应用中，稀疏Transformer相比经典神经ODE方法实现了更高的精度和更快的目标分布收敛速度。

Conclusion: 稀疏Transformer架构通过融入数据先验信息，在优化凸性和稀疏性方面优于传统方法，具有更好的性能和收敛特性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a sparse transformer architecture that incorporates
prior information about the underlying data distribution directly into the
transformer structure of the neural network. The design of the model is
motivated by a special optimal transport problem, namely the regularized
Wasserstein proximal operator, which admits a closed-form solution and turns
out to be a special representation of transformer architectures. Compared with
classical flow-based models, the proposed approach improves the convexity
properties of the optimization problem and promotes sparsity in the generated
samples. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including
applications in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems, we
demonstrate that the sparse transformer achieves higher accuracy and faster
convergence to the target distribution than classical neural ODE-based methods.

Conclusion: SymphonySMoE通过图结构增强了SMoE的鲁棒性，同时保持了可扩展性，适用于大规模系统的微调任务。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has emerged as a promising solution to
achieving unparalleled scalability in deep learning by decoupling model
parameter count from computational cost. By activating only a small subset of
parameters per sample, SMoE enables significant growth in model capacity while
maintaining efficiency. However, SMoE struggles to adapt to distributional
shifts, leading to reduced robustness under data contamination. In this work,
we introduce SymphonySMoE, a novel family of SMoE that introduces a social
graph to model interactions among experts. This graph-based structure enhances
the token routing process, addressing the robustness challenges that are
inherent in conventional SMoE designs. SymphonySMoE is lightweight, modular,
and integrates seamlessly with existing SMoE-based models such as the XMoE and
the Generalist Language Model. We provide both theoretical analysis and
empirical evidence demonstrating SymphonySMoE's advantages over baseline SMoE.
Extensive experiments on language modeling and visual instruction tuning
validate our method's effectiveness. We further highlight the scalability of
SymphonySMoE to models with 4.2 and 7.4 billion parameters, showcasing its
applicability in fine-tuning tasks for large-scale systems.

Conclusion: Input Domain Aware MoE通过概率混合模型的路由框架有效解决了稀疏专家混合模型中的路由问题，实现了更好的专家专业化和计算平衡。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling
large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining
computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts.
However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring,
struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation
leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation,
hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE,
a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to
better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a
mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear
specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike
conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of
task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert
assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task
performance and improved expert utilization balance.

Abstract: We introduce a sequential reinforcement learning framework for imitation
learning designed to model heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators.
Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture
and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some
exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by
environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting:
when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality,
these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot
faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited
interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses
these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss
while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral
data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze
underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a
mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under
varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80
tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions. This benchmark
facilitates research on pollinator cognition and supports ecological governance
by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems. Our findings
shed new light on the learning strategies and memory interplay shaping
pollinator decision-making.

Conclusion: 该方法通过新颖的架构创新有效提升了高维异构数据中的预测性能，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose
significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While
Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles
to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems
with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further
compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local
processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static
feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores
sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural
innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention
mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration,
enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships.
Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics,
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: OracleAD提供了一种简单可解释的异常检测方法，能够直接定位根因变量，在保持高性能的同时提供细粒度的异常诊断能力。

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled.
Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures
tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and
overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and
interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly
detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal
embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input
window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a
self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture
spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are
modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The
projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS)
representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual
scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS,
enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across
individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from
embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD
directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD
achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and
evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

Motivation: 现代数据集通常包含具有复杂依赖关系的高维特征，而本征维度估计面临尺度依赖性的挑战：在精细尺度下噪声会膨胀估计值，在粗尺度下估计值会稳定到较低的尺度不变值。

Method: 引入基于连通性因子(CF)的eDCF方法，这是一个局部连通性度量，能够跨不同尺度稳健估计本征维度，具有可扩展性和并行化特性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够准确检测决策边界中的分形几何结构，证实了其在分析现实结构化数据中的实用性。

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain high-dimensional features exhibiting complex
dependencies. To effectively analyze such data, dimensionality reduction
methods rely on estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension (id) as a measure
of its underlying complexity. However, estimating id is challenging due to its
dependence on scale: at very fine scales, noise inflates id estimates, while at
coarser scales, estimates stabilize to lower, scale-invariant values. This
paper introduces a novel, scalable, and parallelizable method called eDCF,
which is based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric,
to robustly estimate intrinsic dimension across varying scales. Our method
consistently matches leading estimators, achieving comparable values of mean
absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples. Moreover, our
approach also attains higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates, reaching up
to 25.0% compared to 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN, particularly excelling
under medium to high noise levels and large datasets. Further, we showcase our
method's ability to accurately detect fractal geometries in decision
boundaries, confirming its utility for analyzing realistic, structured data.

Motivation: 挑战LLMs在因果发现中表现优异的说法，指出现有评估存在数据集泄漏问题，需要验证LLMs是否真正理解因果结构而非仅靠记忆。

Method: 提出基于近期科学研究的评估协议来防止数据集泄漏，并设计混合方法将LLM预测作为经典PC算法的先验知识。

Conclusion: 呼吁采用基于科学、防泄漏的基准测试，并投资于适合现实世界探究的混合因果发现方法。

Abstract: Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal
discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks
likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that
LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical
statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly
reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization
concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue
that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)
developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to
guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine
LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage
evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We
outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent
publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and
preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.
Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,
they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for
statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as
priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both
LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt
science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal
discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.

Abstract: Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on
life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience
their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health
and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog,
complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions
concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the
potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a
high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a
government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature
learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were
extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily
interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models
(LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular
data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful
counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It
was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the
biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also
conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection
techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary
determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that
health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study
demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly
contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human
behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals
working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical
diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and
variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation
models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early
potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial
inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse
electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open
challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse
EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both
homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG
signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP),
masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust
representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation.
Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive
Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks
are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the
diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages
the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of
embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling
(IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features.
Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning,
demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes
forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and
generalizable neural information processing systems.

*Ang Li,Yifei Wang,Zhihang Yuan,Stefanie Jegelka,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANPO框架通过分离语言反馈和数值奖励的角色来解决LLM强化学习中的样本效率问题，语言指导探索，数值奖励驱动优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM强化学习依赖标量奖励，丢弃了rollout中的文本推理信息，导致模型每次都要重新探索，样本效率低下。

Method: LANPO构建动态经验池，采用奖励无关反思进行样本内自校正，并通过相关抽象从样本间经验中提取可泛化经验。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，7B和14B模型使用LANPO显著优于使用GRPO训练的基线模型。

Conclusion: LANPO为将历史经验整合到LLM强化学习循环中提供了稳健方法，创建了更有效和数据高效的学习智能体。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar
rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the
rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and
hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language
feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL
training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information
leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to
behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we
propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a
framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides
exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic
experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure
feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample
self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable
lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong
baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method
for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more
effective and data-efficient learning agents.

Motivation: 现有无模板方法难以捕捉化学反应中的结构不变性，导致搜索空间过大和预测精度降低。

Method: 开发C-SMILES表示法，结合复制增强机制和SMILES对齐指导，动态决定生成新标记或保留未改变分子片段。

Conclusion: 建立了结构感知分子生成的新范式，在计算药物发现中具有直接应用价值。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction is fundamental to drug discovery and chemical
synthesis, requiring the identification of reactants that can produce a target
molecule. Current template-free methods struggle to capture the structural
invariance inherent in chemical reactions, where substantial molecular
scaffolds remain unchanged, leading to unnecessarily large search spaces and
reduced prediction accuracy. We introduce C-SMILES, a novel molecular
representation that decomposes traditional SMILES into element-token pairs with
five special tokens, effectively minimizing editing distance between reactants
and products. Building upon this representation, we incorporate a
copy-augmented mechanism that dynamically determines whether to generate new
tokens or preserve unchanged molecular fragments from the product. Our approach
integrates SMILES alignment guidance to enhance attention consistency with
ground-truth atom mappings, enabling more chemically coherent predictions.
Comprehensive evaluation on USPTO-50K and large-scale USPTO-FULL datasets
demonstrates significant improvements: 67.2% top-1 accuracy on USPTO-50K and
50.8% on USPTO-FULL, with 99.9% validity in generated molecules. This work
establishes a new paradigm for structure-aware molecular generation with direct
applications in computational drug discovery.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the
scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised
methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring
labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the
molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs
a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical
labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this
position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class
examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to
single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.
Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our
work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically
plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and
final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work
also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by
mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing
data scarcity.

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple
layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data.
Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on
difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter
symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their
hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and
network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when
learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the
central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries
and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition
between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or
overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this
poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by
recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an
established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically
validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the
internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These
findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and
their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种四元数值监督学习Hopfield结构化神经网络(QSHNN)，利用四元数在表示旋转和姿态方面的几何优势，通过周期性投影策略保持四元数结构一致性，在机器人控制等应用中表现出高精度和快速收敛。

Conclusion: 该模型为超复数或非交换代数结构下的神经网络设计提供了实用的实现框架和通用数学方法学。

Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing
rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning
Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure
inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a
continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the
quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points
with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic
projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically
projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic
structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence
and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous
mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high
accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated
target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit
well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for
applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms,
where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these
application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation
framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks
under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时增强（如RAG）中模型参数知识与外部检索信息的关系，通过将多步推理建模为知识图上的连通性问题，揭示了参数知识密度与增强效率之间的相变现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解测试时增强（如RAG）中模型参数知识与外部检索信息之间的理论关系，特别是确定在少量增强步骤下准确回答问题所需的最小预训练知识量。

Method: 将多步推理建模为知识图上的s-t连通性问题，将模型的预训练参数知识表示为部分且可能有噪声的子图，将增强视为查询真实边来扩展模型知识。

Result: 发现了相变现象：当参数知识图断开成小分量时，通过增强寻找路径效率低下，需要Ω(√n)次查询；但当正确知识密度超过阈值形成巨分量时，可以用期望常数次查询找到路径。

Conclusion: 模型参数知识的结构密度对测试时增强的效率有决定性影响，存在一个临界密度阈值，超过该阈值后增强效率会显著提升。

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool
use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge
and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of
this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how
much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number
of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address
this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity
problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric
knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as
querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we
characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the
model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key
result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices
is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is
inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once
the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant
component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

*Jiatong Yu,Yinghui He,Anirudh Goyal,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 多阶段训练中的机器遗忘存在根本性障碍，局部遗忘方法无法普遍实现重训练等价性，因为遗忘结果受训练阶段顺序影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代训练流程通常涉及多阶段训练，每个阶段有不同的数据分布和目标，而现有的机器遗忘理论主要针对i.i.d.数据批次训练，需要研究多阶段训练对遗忘的影响。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析多阶段训练对机器遗忘的影响，在Llama和Qwen模型上使用梯度上升、NPO和SimNPO等局部遗忘算法进行实证研究。

Result: 不同训练阶段顺序的模型在遗忘过程中行为差异显著，GSM8K准确率下降差异超过20%，某些学习路径产生的模型遗忘速度较慢，概率质量分布也呈现路径依赖性。

Conclusion: 重训练等价性对于局部遗忘算法来说是一个不适定的目标，在无法获取模型训练历史的情况下需要重新思考机器遗忘的定义和期望目标。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to selectively remove the "influence" of specific
training data on a model's outputs. The ideal goal is Retrain
Equivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the
retained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data
batches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each
stage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM
fine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory
and experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a
fundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the
outcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the
forget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is
influenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it
impossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain
Equivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM
post-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent,
NPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms. Models fine-tuned via different
orderings of identical training stages diverge in behavior during unlearning,
with the degradation in GSM8K accuracy after unlearning varying by over 20%
across paths. We also observe that some learning paths consistently produce
models that unlearn slowly. During unlearning, whether the probability mass
gets squeezed into paraphrasing or alternative concepts is also path-dependent.
These results consistently show that Retrain Equivalence is an ill-posed target
for local unlearning algorithms, so long as the target models are trained in
stages. In situations where access to models' training histories is hard, the
current work calls for rethinking the definition and desiderata of machine
unlearning.

Method: 提出StructureFlow方法，这是一种原理性的模拟自由方法，能够联合学习物理系统的结构和随机群体动态。该方法支持从干预中学习结构和对条件群体动态进行轨迹推断。

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal
relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various
physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently
high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state
measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of
modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these
systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning
or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability
to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems
simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled
simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic
population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of
StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and
dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We
empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set
of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell
dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying
systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics --
a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba架构在自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域表现出色，优于Transformer模型，因此希望将其应用于蛋白质-蛋白质对接评分任务。

Method: 将PIsToN中的Vision Transformer骨干网络替换为Vision Mamba架构，利用Mamba在图像补丁序列上的高效长程序列建模能力。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的大规模公共数据集上评估表明，PUMBA持续优于其基于Transformer的前身PIsToN。

Conclusion: 使用Vision Mamba架构显著提升了模型捕捉蛋白质-蛋白质界面特征中全局和局部模式的能力。

Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins,
and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the
accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can
reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a
state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision
Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has
demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and
computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains.
In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with
Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer
backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient
long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the
model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein
interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several
widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently
outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

Abstract: In many scientific and engineering fields, where acquiring high-quality data
is expensive--such as medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote
sensing--strategic sampling of unobserved regions based on prior observations
is crucial for maximizing discovery rates within a constrained budget. The rise
of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active
target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned
priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from
data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations,
these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct
queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong
prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such
as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these
methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with
uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex
real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws
inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies,
our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into
decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in
prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate
sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings.
Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains,
including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that
our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.

Result: 在MIT-BIH数据集上，GRU-D在心动过速风险预测上略优于Transformer，而Transformer在心率预测误差上明显低于GRU-D和持续性基准。

Conclusion: 模型选择是任务依赖的：紧凑RNN在短时风险评分中保持竞争力，而紧凑Transformer在点预测中表现更优。

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time
series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two
tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term
tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We
compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against
strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for
classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped
bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the
Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers
forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in
longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain
competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers
deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

Abstract: The interplay between optimization and privacy has become a central theme in
privacy-preserving machine learning. Noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm, particularly in large-scale settings.
These variants of gradient methods inject carefully calibrated noise into each
update to achieve differential privacy, the gold standard notion of rigorous
privacy guarantees. Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical
risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \textit{exact} behavior of the
process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work
leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a
continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and
privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions. Moreover, we study a variant of noisy
SGD that does not require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity, unlike
existing work that assumes or enforces sensitivity through gradient clipping.
Specifically, we focus on the least squares problem with $\ell_2$
regularization.

Abstract: Secure federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy during distributed
model training. However, deploying such frameworks across heterogeneous devices
results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited
computational or network capabilities, slowing training for all participating
clients. This paper introduces the first straggler mitigation technique for
secure aggregation with deep neural networks. We propose CLIP, a client-side
invariant neuron pruning technique coupled with network-aware pruning, that
addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training

TL;DR: 提出了一种分辨率感知的检索增强预测模型，通过利用空间相关性和时间频率特性来提高零样本预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本预测旨在预测没有直接历史数据的未见条件下的结果，这对传统预测方法构成了重大挑战。

Method: 通过将信号分解为不同频率分量，采用分辨率感知检索方法：低频分量依赖更广泛的空间上下文，高频分量关注局部影响，从而动态检索相关数据并适应新位置。

Result: 在微气候预测中，该模型显著优于传统预测方法、数值天气预报模型和现代基础时间序列模型，在ERA5数据集上比HRRR的MSE降低71%，比Chronos降低34%。

Conclusion: 检索增强和分辨率感知策略在零样本预测中非常有效，为微气候建模及其他领域提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen
conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for
traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by
leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By
decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs
resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader
spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences.
This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new
locations with minimal historical context.
  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms
traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and
modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34%
lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset.
  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and
resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution
for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.

*Yizuo Chen,Adnan Darwiche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于状态的因果效应可识别性，证明了即使变量层面的因果效应不可识别，特定状态层面的因果效应仍可能可识别，这需要上下文特定独立性和条件函数依赖等额外知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果效应可识别性定义基于变量层面，但实际应用中可能更关心特定状态间的因果效应。本文旨在研究状态层面因果效应的可识别性及其与变量层面可识别性的关系。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究状态层面因果效应的可识别性条件，探讨上下文特定独立性、条件函数依赖等额外知识对可识别性的影响。

Result: 发现状态层面因果效应在变量层面因果效应不可识别时仍可能可识别，这种分离仅在有额外知识时发生。变量状态约束知识本身不能改善可识别性，但与其他知识结合时可同时改善变量和状态层面的可识别性。

Conclusion: 现有变量层面的因果效应框架可能错过一些实际可识别的因果效应，状态层面的分析能够发现更多从观测数据中可估计的因果效应。

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of
treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability
of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of
treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We
demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when
variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation
occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific
independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We
further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show
that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve
both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other
knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight
situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational
data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based
frameworks.

Conclusion: 该模块化框架可适应不同部署场景，为电动汽车充电基础设施的规划和运营提供有效支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for processing EV charging load data in order
to forecast future load predictions using a Recurrent Neural Network,
specifically an LSTM. The framework processes a large set of raw data from
multiple locations and transforms it with normalization and feature extraction
to train the LSTM. The pre-processing stage corrects for missing or incomplete
values by interpolating and normalizing the measurements. This information is
then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory Model designed to capture the short-term
fluctuations while also interpreting the long-term trends in the charging data.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict
charging demand across multiple time scales (daily, weekly, and monthly),
providing valuable insights for infrastructure planning, energy management, and
grid integration of EV charging facilities. The system's modular design allows
for adaptation to different charging locations with varying usage patterns,
making it applicable across diverse deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法促进了以更低成本开发概率性缩放定律，通过主动学习策略可以减少预测不确定性，提供接近真实缩放定律的预测。

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance
objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs
associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate
the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is
modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared
information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ
latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task
correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We
demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic
scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be
queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to
ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP
datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from
bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual
translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于SegDeformer的联合特征和任务解码方法，在车载和分布式应用中降低计算复杂度，同时保持语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代汽车系统使用DNN进行语义分割，存在车载（无传输限制）和分布式（有传输比特率限制）两种应用场景。现有工作使用CNN进行联合源和任务解码，但未研究性能更优但计算复杂度更高的transformer替代方案。

Method: 为SegDeformer提出联合特征和任务解码方法，在保持性能的同时降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在车载应用中，Cityscapes数据集上fps提升11.7倍（1.4到16.5fps），ADE20K数据集上提升3.5倍（43.3到154.3fps），mIoU与未压缩的transformer基线相当。在分布式应用中，在广泛比特率范围内实现了SOTA的mIoU，仅使用先前SOTA云DNN参数的0.14%（ADE20K）和0.04%（Cityscapes）。

Conclusion: 该方法成功降低了SegDeformer的计算复杂度，提高了车载和分布式应用的可扩展性，在保持性能的同时显著提升了处理速度并减少了云资源需求。

Abstract: Modern automotive systems leverage deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic
segmentation and operate in two key application areas: (1) In-car, where the
DNN solely operates in the vehicle without strict constraints on the data rate.
(2) Distributed, where one DNN part operates in the vehicle and the other part
typically on a large-scale cloud platform with a particular constraint on
transmission bitrate efficiency. Typically, both applications share an image
and source encoder, while each uses distinct (joint) source and task decoders.
Prior work utilized convolutional neural networks for joint source and task
decoding but did not investigate transformer-based alternatives such as
SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher
computational complexity. In this work, we propose joint feature and task
decoding for SegDeformer, thereby enabling lower computational complexity in
both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational
demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car
computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames
per second (fps) by up to a factor of $11.7$ ($1.4$ fps to $16.5$ fps) on
Cityscapes and by up to a factor of $3.5$ ($43.3$ fps to $154.3$ fps) on
ADE20K, while being on-par w.r.t.\ the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of
the transformer-based baseline that doesn't compress by a source codec. For the
distributed application, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) over a wide range
of bitrates on the mIoU metric, while using only $0.14$\% ($0.04$\%) of cloud
DNN parameters used in previous SOTA, reported on ADE20K (Cityscapes).

TL;DR: 提出了SAMOSA方法，一种基于锐度感知最小化的开放集主动学习方法，通过选择典型性样本有效减少标注成本，在多个数据集上比现有方法提升3%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习需要大量数据收集，但标注成本高昂。开放集主动学习旨在从未标注数据中选择信息量大的样本，其中包含不相关或未知类别

Method: 基于SGD和SAM的理论发现，SAMOSA根据样本典型性主动查询样本，识别嵌入流形中靠近模型决策边界的非典型样本

Result: 在多个数据集上实现比现有技术高3%的准确率提升，且不引入计算开销

Conclusion: SAMOSA能有效识别对目标类别高度信息丰富且有助于区分目标类别与不需要类别的样本

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where
labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning
approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled
data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose
Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an
effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the
impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM),
SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively
identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold
close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the
samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii)
useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive
experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the
state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational
overhead. The source code of our experiments is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D第一人称视频游戏是实时多模态推理的挑战性环境，需要解决现有数据集规模不足和多样性有限的问题。

Method: 收集大规模多样化的人类游戏数据集，训练逆动力学模型来推断缺失动作，使用行为克隆方法训练文本条件代理，采用支持实时推理的自定义架构。

Result: 模型能够在多种3D游戏中执行操作并响应文本输入，在消费级GPU上实现实时推理。

Conclusion: 虽然模型在游戏操作和文本响应方面表现出色，但仍面临长时程任务和大规模游戏定量评估等挑战。

Abstract: We argue that 3-D first-person video games are a challenging environment for
real-time multi-modal reasoning. We first describe our dataset of human
game-play, collected across a large variety of 3-D first-person games, which is
both substantially larger and more diverse compared to prior publicly disclosed
datasets, and contains text instructions. We demonstrate that we can learn an
inverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on
a much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack
recorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using
behavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a
consumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of
3-D games and responding to text input. Finally, we outline some of the
remaining challenges such as long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation
across a large set of games.

TL;DR: 3D-GSRD是一种3D分子图自编码器，通过选择性重掩码解码解决3D掩码图建模中的2D结构泄露问题，在分子性质预测基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将掩码图建模从2D扩展到3D面临挑战：既要避免2D结构信息泄露到解码器，又要提供足够的2D上下文来重建重掩码原子

Method: 提出选择性重掩码解码(SRD)，仅从编码器表示中重掩码3D相关信息，同时保留2D图结构；结合3D关系变换器编码器和结构无关解码器

Result: 在MD17分子性质预测基准测试中，8个目标中有7个达到新的最先进性能

Conclusion: 选择性重掩码解码与结构无关解码器结合增强了编码器在分子表示学习中的作用，3D-GSRD在3D分子表示学习方面表现出色

Abstract: Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular
representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask
decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting
challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing
sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms.To address these
challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with
Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its
Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information
from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures.This SRD
is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans)
encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD,
combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in
MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream
performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely
used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark. The code is released at

Abstract: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented
computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and
deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential
compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and
accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8,
INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in
sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization
offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across
layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks
for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform
and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used
in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM
frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision
configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative
analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and
deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier
mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying
strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting.
Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including
hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization
methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this
work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research
prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种计算预算感知的数据选择方法(CADS)，通过双层优化框架将计算预算约束集成到数据选择策略中，在视觉和语言基准测试中比基线方法性能提升高达14.42%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法忽略了计算预算约束，将数据选择和重要性评估与预算限制独立处理。实证研究表明，在不同预算下没有算法能始终优于其他方法（甚至随机选择），因此计算预算必须成为数据选择策略的核心组成部分。

Method: 提出了计算预算感知数据选择(CADS)方法，采用双层优化框架：内层循环在选定数据子集上训练模型（受计算预算约束），外层循环基于模型评估优化数据选择。通过概率重参数化策略和Hessian-free策略梯度估计器解决Hessian矩阵估计问题，通过将内层优化转化为外层目标惩罚项来提高效率。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，该方法比基线方法实现了高达14.42%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 计算预算应该作为数据选择策略的核心组成部分，CADS方法通过双层优化框架有效解决了预算约束下的数据选择问题，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative
subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute
budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of
compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can
consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying
budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to
data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements
on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this
end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method
and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the
inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget
on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data
selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in
addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:
the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the
computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To
solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy
and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To
address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into
a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to
estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,
significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and
language benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SkipV1Former是一种Transformer变体，通过从第一层的Value头添加跳跃连接来增强模型表示能力并减少KV缓存，在减少约25% KV缓存的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer扩展方法要么提高表达能力但KV成本不变，要么减少内存但削弱表示能力。需要一种既能增强表示又能减少资源消耗的方法。

Method: 从第二块开始，每层重用第一层一半的Value头，另一半正常计算，从而减少近50%的Value投影和V缓存。

Result: 在不同模型规模下，SkipV1Former能持续减少约25%的KV缓存，同时相对于标准MHA Transformer和一些先进变体提升困惑度。

Conclusion: SkipV1Former提供了一种有效平衡表示能力和资源消耗的方法，可与现有技术结合实现进一步优化，并能通过少量额外计算对现有模型进行升级。

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by
their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them
to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and
compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive
decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation
without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve
expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of
weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer
variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to
strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the
second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very
first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections
and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed
first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression
and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of
Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model
scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in
KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention
(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe
for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only
10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine
advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to
achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined
with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving
performance.

Result: 实验证实，在各种环境中，本文方法与现有基线方法之间存在显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: 父节点识别对于遗憾最小化是不必要的，学习父节点集是次优策略。

Abstract: We study regret minimization in causal bandits under causal sufficiency where
the underlying causal structure is not known to the agent. Previous work has
focused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit
methods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We
investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively,
our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by
proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent
identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze
both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret
lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space.
Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass
graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed
unnecessary for regret minimization. Experiments confirm that there exists a
large performance gap between our method and existing baselines in various
environments.

Motivation: 解决考古学中结构性标签稀缺问题——正样本稀少且大多数位置未标记，需要开发能够处理严重类别不平衡的预测模型。

Method: 采用半监督正未标记学习策略，实现为语义分割模型，使用动态伪标记并结合RNN实现的CRF来提高标签置信度。

Result: 在DEM数据集上性能与最先进的LAMAP相当但Dice分数更高；在原始卫星图像上保持性能并产生更具可解释性的预测表面。

Conclusion: 半监督学习为在大规模稀疏标注景观中识别未发现遗址提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are
likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and
geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach
but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology:
positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt
a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a
semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a
representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic
pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via
an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a
geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model
performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice
scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold
cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with
improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised
learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across
large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity
$\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$,
while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often
suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned
challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear
Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high
accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO
resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll
N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention
mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$
while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we
demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating
improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses
current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with
slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement
across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and
softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy
foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

*Doyoon Kim,Junbin Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TRPINN方法，在Sobolev-Slobodeckij范数H^{1/2}(∂Ω)中执行边界损失，这是与H^1(Ω)相关的正确迹空间。通过仅计算半范数的理论必要部分来降低计算成本，并通过避免离散化中的分母评估来增强收敛稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准物理信息神经网络(PINN)在处理高度振荡的Dirichlet边界条件时可能失败，需要改进边界损失的计算方法以提高收敛性和稳定性。

Method: 使用TRPINN方法，在正确的迹空间H^{1/2}(∂Ω)中执行边界损失，仅计算半范数的必要部分，避免分母评估，并通过神经切线核(NTK)分析进行理论验证。

Result: 数值实验显示TRPINN在标准PINN失败的情况下仍能成功，性能提升1-3个十进制位数，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: TRPINN通过使用正确的迹空间范数，显著提高了PINN在处理复杂边界条件时的性能和稳定性，理论分析和实验结果均验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace
Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the
boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the
correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost
by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and
enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the
discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we
show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the
$H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we
demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical
experiments on the Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary
conditions exhibit cases where TRPINN succeeds even when standard PINNs fail,
and show performance improvements of one to three decimal digits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器的解释依赖于输入，单独研究不完整。多项式作为代数基元可以在不参考输入的情况下进行分析，并能描述从线性概念到复杂流形的结构

Method: 使用双线性自编码器高效地将表示分解为二次多项式，通过改进引入重要性排序、聚类和激活稀疏性

Result: 开发了一种将神经网络表示分解为二次多项式的方法，这是通过代数特性实现非线性但可分析潜在表示的第一步

Conclusion: 这是通过代数特性实现非线性但可分析潜在表示的初步进展，为理解神经网络表示提供了新的代数视角

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a standard tool for uncovering interpretable latent
representations in neural networks. Yet, their interpretation depends on the
inputs, making their isolated study incomplete. Polynomials offer a solution;
they serve as algebraic primitives that can be analysed without reference to
input and can describe structures ranging from linear concepts to complicated
manifolds. This work uses bilinear autoencoders to efficiently decompose
representations into quadratic polynomials. We discuss improvements that induce
importance ordering, clustering, and activation sparsity. This is an initial
step toward nonlinear yet analysable latents through their algebraic
properties.

TL;DR: ProtoMol是一个原型引导的多模态分子表示学习框架，通过分层编码器和双向跨模态注意力机制，实现分子图与文本描述之间的细粒度整合和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法存在两个关键限制：(1)仅在最终编码层进行跨模态交互，忽略了分层语义依赖；(2)缺乏统一的原型空间来实现模态间的鲁棒对齐。

Method: 采用双分支分层编码器（GNN处理分子图，Transformer编码文本），引入分层双向跨模态注意力机制，并构建共享原型空间与可学习的类特定锚点。

Conclusion: ProtoMol通过分层跨模态交互和原型引导的语义对齐，显著提升了多模态分子表示学习的预测准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular
graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and
interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug
toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration
of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods
suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal
interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical
semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust
alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained
integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and
textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders,
utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and
Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive
layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise
bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns
semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with
learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities
toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction
tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive
electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle
range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable
trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that
sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers
transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations --
inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors
exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present
DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations
generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset
systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided
Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including
complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal
airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a
five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies
with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on
this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs
from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic
machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new
standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development.
Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for
integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit
innovation.

Motivation: 现有的持续表示学习方法直接利用预训练特征进行下游任务时，在相似性匹配阶段容易遭受多重共线性问题，而更先进的方法对于实时低延迟应用来说计算成本过高。

Method: 提出Fly-CL框架，采用果蝇嗅觉回路的生物启发设计，通过渐进式解决多重共线性问题，实现更有效的相似性匹配，具有低时间复杂度。

Conclusion: Fly-CL通过生物启发设计成功解决了持续表示学习中的多重共线性挑战，为实时低延迟应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning
paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained
features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the
similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally
prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly
olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with
a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training
time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current
state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively
resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with
low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network
architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing
this challenge through a biologically inspired design. Code is available at

*Heming Zou,Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了UDS（Utility-Diversity Sampling）框架，用于在监督微调中实现高效的在线批次选择，通过同时考虑数据效用和多样性来优化训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线批次选择方法存在三个主要问题：(i)仅依赖数据效用而忽视多样性；(ii)需要外部资源如参考模型或验证集；(iii)训练时间超过全数据集训练。UDS旨在解决这些限制。

Method: UDS利用对数矩阵的核范数捕获数据效用和样本内多样性，同时通过轻量级历史样本缓冲区进行高效的低维嵌入比较来估计样本间多样性。该设计无需外部资源和不必要的反向传播。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，UDS在不同数据预算下始终优于最先进的在线批次选择方法，并且相比全数据集微调显著减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: UDS提供了一个无需外部资源、计算高效的在线批次选择框架，在监督微调中实现了更好的性能和更快的训练速度。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large
language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset
is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias
amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which
prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online
batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the
training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on
the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors
like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or
validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset
training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS
(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection
in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both
data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample
diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a
lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the
need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing
computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods
under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to
full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

TL;DR: UniGTE是一个指令调优的编码器-解码器框架，通过结合图结构和语义推理，在无需任务特定监督的情况下实现跨任务和跨领域的零样本图推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统图神经网络固定标签空间和大语言模型难以捕捉图结构的局限性，实现通用的图任务泛化能力。

Method: 编码器使用可学习的对齐标记和结构感知的图-文本注意力机制，解码器是冻结的LLM，通过重构目标正则化编码器。

Result: 在节点分类、链接预测、图分类和图回归任务上实现了新的零样本最先进结果，在跨任务和跨域设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: 图结构与LLM语义的紧密集成能够实现鲁棒、可迁移的图推理能力。

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is
challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed
label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph
structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework
that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a
pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a
structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly
to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining
permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph
representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM
decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and
simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The
reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues.
UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level,
and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at
inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node
classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression
under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight
integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable
graph reasoning.

Conclusion: 通过DeepChem的扩展，显著降低了SE(3)-等变模型的使用门槛，促进了这些模型在分子性质预测、蛋白质结构建模和材料设计等领域的应用和进一步发展。

Abstract: Neural networks that incorporate geometric relationships respecting SE(3)
group transformations (e.g. rotations and translations) are increasingly
important in molecular applications, such as molecular property prediction,
protein structure modeling, and materials design. These models, known as
SE(3)-equivariant neural networks, ensure outputs transform predictably with
input coordinate changes by explicitly encoding spatial atomic positions.
Although libraries such as E3NN [4] and SE(3)-TRANSFORMER [3 ] offer powerful
implementations, they often require substantial deep learning or mathematical
prior knowledge and lack complete training pipelines. We extend DEEPCHEM [ 13]
with support for ready-to-use equivariant models, enabling scientists with
minimal deep learning background to build, train, and evaluate models, such as
SE(3)-Transformer and Tensor Field Networks. Our implementation includes
equivariant models, complete training pipelines, and a toolkit of equivariant
utilities, supported with comprehensive tests and documentation, to facilitate
both application and further development of SE(3)-equivariant models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electricity prices is crucial for stakeholders in the
energy market, particularly for grid operators, energy producers, and
consumers. This study focuses on developing a predictive model leveraging Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in
the California energy market. The model incorporates a variety of features,
including historical price data, weather conditions, and the energy generation
mix. A novel custom loss function that integrates Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and a smoothness penalty is introduced to
enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, an online
learning approach is implemented to allow the model to adapt to new data
incrementally, ensuring continuous relevance and accuracy. The results
demonstrate that the custom loss function can improve the model's performance,
aligning predicted prices more closely with actual values, particularly during
peak intervals. Also, the online learning model outperforms other models by
effectively incorporating real-time data, resulting in lower prediction error
and variability. The inclusion of the energy generation mix further enhances
the model's predictive capabilities, highlighting the importance of
comprehensive feature integration. This research provides a robust framework
for electricity price forecasting, offering valuable insights and tools for

Abstract: The effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is
significantly hindered by unstructured clinical documentation, which results in
noisy, inconsistent, and logically fragmented training data. To address this
challenge, we present a knowledge-driven framework that integrates the
standardized clinical terminology SNOMED CT with the Neo4j graph database to
construct a structured medical knowledge graph. In this graph, clinical
entities such as diseases, symptoms, and medications are represented as nodes,
and semantic relationships such as ``caused by,'' ``treats,'' and ``belongs
to'' are modeled as edges in Neo4j, with types mapped from formal SNOMED CT
relationship concepts (e.g., \texttt{Causative agent}, \texttt{Indicated for}).
This design enables multi-hop reasoning and ensures terminological consistency.
By extracting and standardizing entity-relationship pairs from clinical texts,
we generate structured, JSON-formatted datasets that embed explicit diagnostic
pathways. These datasets are used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs),
significantly improving the clinical logic consistency of their outputs.
Experimental results demonstrate that our knowledge-guided approach enhances
the validity and interpretability of AI-generated diagnostic reasoning,
providing a scalable solution for building reliable AI-assisted clinical
systems.

Abstract: How can short-term energy consumption be accurately forecasted when sensor
data is noisy, incomplete, and lacks contextual richness? This question guided
our participation in the \textit{2025 Competition on Electric Energy
Consumption Forecast Adopting Multi-criteria Performance Metrics}, which
challenged teams to predict next-day power demand using real-world
high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL)
pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial
regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard
Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model
achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy.
Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured
nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably,
spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature
trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability.
These results demonstrate that targeted preprocessing paired with compact
recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready
energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: DoT方法能够从DGCL中积累领域泛化知识，为跨域持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems
must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen
scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain
generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with
each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered
tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,
retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for
robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)
methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific
generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains
for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose
adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach
tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human
brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in
representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across
various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized
predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates
state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and
parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive
experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge
from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling
complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing
methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization
across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce
SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve
diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM
generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code,
guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the
search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for
adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide
exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to
incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both
prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization
without additional training.

Conclusion: 通过将Hessian理论扩展到完整Transformer架构，为大规模深度学习优化的理论和实证研究建立了新基础。

Abstract: The lack of theoretical results for Layer Normalization and feedforward
Hessians has left a gap in the study of Transformer optimization landscapes. We
address this by deriving explicit second-order expressions for these
components, thereby completing the Hessian characterization of full Transformer
blocks. Our results generalize prior self-attention analyses and yield
estimations for the role of each sublayer in curvature propagation. We
demonstrate how these Hessian structures inform both convergence dynamics and
the empirical scaling laws governing large-model performance. Further, we
propose a Taylor-expansion-based framework for analyzing loss differences to
quantify convergence trajectories. By extending Hessian theory to the full
Transformer architecture, this work establishes a new foundation for
theoretical and empirical investigations of optimization in large-scale deep
learning.

*Cristian J. Vaca-Rubio,Roberto Pereira,Luis Blanco,Engin Zeydan,Màrius Caus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P-KAN是一种概率性Kolmogorov-Arnold网络，通过将标量权重替换为基于样条的函数连接并直接参数化预测分布，为时间序列预测提供表达力强且参数高效的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够捕捉非线性和重尾动态的不确定性感知预测模型，特别适用于卫星通信等资源受限领域的动态阈值资源分配。

Method: 使用基于样条的函数连接替代标量权重，直接参数化预测分布，构建了高斯分布和Student-t分布两种变体。

Result: P-KAN在卫星流量预测中持续优于多层感知机基线，在准确性和校准方面表现更好，使用显著更少的参数实现优越的效率-风险权衡。

Conclusion: P-KAN为概率预测提供了一个强大框架，特别适用于卫星通信和其他资源受限领域，高斯变体适合安全关键场景，Student-t变体在稳定需求下提高效率。

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel
probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series
forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional
connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer
expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and
heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting,
where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource
allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer
Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior
efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build
up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions.
The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for
safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper
distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings
establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with
direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained
domains.

*Dania Refai,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个组件级的评估框架，用于评估LLM生成的数学优化公式，超越了传统的整体评估方法，通过精确度、召回率、RMSE等细粒度指标来分析决策变量和约束条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法通常将公式视为整体，依赖解决方案准确性或运行时间等粗略指标，这些指标掩盖了结构或数值错误。需要更细粒度的评估框架来诊断LLM在优化建模中的表现。

Method: 开发了包含决策变量和约束的精确度与召回率、约束和目标函数的RMSE、基于token使用和延迟的效率指标的综合评估框架。评估了GPT-5、LLaMA 3.1 Instruct和DeepSeek Math在不同复杂度优化问题下的六种提示策略。

Result: GPT-5始终优于其他模型，思维链、自一致性和模块化提示策略最有效。求解器性能主要取决于高约束召回率和低约束RMSE，约束精确度和决策变量指标起次要作用，简洁输出提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 提出了NLP到优化建模的三个原则：完整约束覆盖防止违规、最小化约束RMSE确保求解器级准确性、简洁输出提高计算效率。该框架为LLM在优化建模中的细粒度诊断评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural
language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current
evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like
solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In
this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework
for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our
framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision
variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error
(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate
GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of
varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5
consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,
and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver
performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint
RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.
Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while
concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight
three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint
coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures
solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational
efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained,
diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种概率深度学习方法（分位数回归神经网络、变分自编码器、扩散模型）在次季节尺度风场预报中的统计降尺度应用，相比传统随机扰动方法能更好地表征空间不确定性和物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 次季节预报通常依赖大尺度大气预测因子，但传统基于模型残差的随机扰动方法无法充分表征空间相关性和物理一致性，需要更复杂的方法来捕捉大尺度预测因子与局地预测变量之间的复杂关系。

Method: 使用三种概率深度学习方法：直接建模分布分位数的分位数回归神经网络、利用潜在空间采样的变分自编码器、以及使用迭代去噪的扩散模型。这些模型在ERA5再分析数据上训练，并应用于ECMWF次季节后报。

Result: 概率降尺度方法相比简单随机方法提供了更真实的空间不确定性表征，每种概率模型在集合离散度、确定性技能和物理一致性方面各有优势。

Conclusion: 概率降尺度是增强业务次季节风场预报的有效方法，对可再生能源规划和风险评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when
regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for
sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale
atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which
exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to
obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)
demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve
ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but
this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency
adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex
relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while
maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer
promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study
evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification
mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models
distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space
sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models
are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts
to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that
probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty
representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic
model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,
deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish
probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational
sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

Motivation: 现有基于自身份或输出相似性的KD检测方法容易被提示工程规避，存在知识产权保护和LLM多样性风险，需要更鲁棒的检测手段。

Method: 利用MoE结构习惯（特别是内部路由模式）作为检测信号，分析专家专业化与协作模式；提出Shadow-MoE黑盒方法通过辅助蒸馏构建代理MoE表示来比较任意模型对。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models
(LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks.
Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can
be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection
framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an
overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal
routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and
collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that
persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup
and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that
constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare
these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive,
reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an
extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong
robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while
highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

Motivation: 社会科学中常见中小规模数据集，现有差分隐私线性回归方法主要关注点估计，缺乏不确定性量化，且不支持合成数据生成。主流合成数据方法要么适用于离散数据，要么需要大数据集，不适用于社会科学中的连续小数据。

Method: 提出高斯差分隐私下的偏差校正估计器，具有渐近置信区间，以及一个通用的合成数据生成程序，其中在合成数据上的回归与我们的差分隐私回归相匹配。采用分箱聚合策略，适用于中小维度设置。

Conclusion: 该方法在差分隐私下为线性回归提供了有效的统计推断和合成数据生成能力，特别适合社会科学中的中小规模连续数据集应用。

Abstract: In social sciences, small- to medium-scale datasets are common and linear
regression (LR) is canonical. In privacy-aware settings, much work has focused
on differentially private (DP) LR, but mostly on point estimation with limited
attention to uncertainty quantification. Meanwhile, synthetic data generation
(SDG) is increasingly important for reproducibility studies, yet current DP LR
methods do not readily support it. Mainstream SDG approaches are either
tailored to discretized data, making them less suitable for continuous
regression, or rely on deep models that require large datasets, limiting their
use for the smaller, continuous data typical in social science. We propose a
method for LR with valid inference under Gaussian DP: a DP bias-corrected
estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) and a general SDG
procedure in which regression on the synthetic data matches our DP regression.
Our binning-aggregation strategy is effective in small- to moderate-dimensional
settings. Experiments show our method (1) improves accuracy over existing
methods, (2) provides valid CIs, and (3) produces more reliable synthetic data
for downstream ML tasks than current DP SDGs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuonBP通过分块周期性正交化方法，在保持Muon优化器性能的同时显著减少了模型并行训练中的通信开销，实现了8%的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Muon优化器在模型并行训练中由于梯度正交化引入的额外通信开销问题，该开销相比AdamW会导致5%-10%的吞吐量下降。

Method: 提出MuonBP方法，在每个设备上独立对矩阵分块进行正交化，并周期性执行完整正交化以保持训练稳定性，同时使用两种学习率分别用于分块正交化步骤和完整正交化步骤。

Result: 在8B模型训练中，使用8路张量并行和ZeRO优化器状态分片，MuonBP相比Muon实现了8%的吞吐量提升，且没有性能下降。

Conclusion: MuonBP方法简单，需要最少的超参数调整，在保持竞争性迭代复杂度的同时，提供了与AdamW等坐标方法相当的每轮迭代吞吐量。

Abstract: Gradient orthogonalization is a simple strategy that shows great utility in
speeding up gradient descent. The Muon optimizer (Jordan, Jin, et al., 2024)
combines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves
significant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model
parallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared
to coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and
scatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This
additional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to
Adam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic
Orthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to
matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization
to maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning
rate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this
algorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for
the blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization
steps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and
achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while
providing per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such
as AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO
optimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to
Muon with no degradation in performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界多模态数据具有复杂的结构关系，而现有方法未能区分多跳邻居并将图视为独立模态，这限制了整体理解能力。

Method: 提出Graph4MM框架，包含Hop-Diffused Attention（通过因果掩码和跳扩散整合多跳结构信息）和MM-QFormer（多映射查询变换器用于跨模态融合）。

Result: 在生成式和判别式任务上，Graph4MM优于更大的视觉语言模型、大语言模型和多模态图基线方法，平均提升6.93%。

Conclusion: 利用结构信息整合模态内和模态间交互，能够比将图作为独立模态更好地提升多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships
beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities
across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming
diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.
Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and
inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish
multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which
fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key
challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from
multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific
information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the
role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and
propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,
we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural
information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.
Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for
cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that
leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions
improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone
modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that
Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,
achieving a 6.93% average improvement.

Motivation: 传统基于LLM的电路设计方法主要依赖SPICE网表等文本表示，缺乏视觉可解释性，不利于电路设计师理解和验证电路功能。

Method: 集成文本、视觉和符号模态，使用6个模拟子结构示例进行少样本布局，采用视觉思维链策略迭代优化布局和布线，提高原理图清晰度和对称性。

Conclusion: EEschematic成功实现了从SPICE网表到可编辑电路原理图的自动转换，为模拟电路设计提供了更好的视觉理解和验证工具。

Abstract: Circuit schematics play a crucial role in analog integrated circuit design,
serving as the primary medium for human understanding and verification of
circuit functionality. While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches
have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely
solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual
interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose
EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual,
and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams
represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog
substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought
(VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic
clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits,
including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance
amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that
EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural
correctness.

Motivation: 在共享GPU服务器中服务LLM应用时，主流调度器由于队头阻塞或资源分配过约束，无法保证最坏情况性能，需要设计公平且高效的调度方案。

Result: 在vLLM上实现Justitia，实验结果显示它能显著提升调度效率同时保持公平性。

Conclusion: Justitia调度器能够有效解决LLM应用在共享GPU服务器中的调度问题，实现公平高效的服务。

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a
series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve
real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the
schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed
worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well
for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained
resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a
fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel
scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a
bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the
service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses
a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand
prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing
algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.
We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving
diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling
efficiency with fairness preserved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源权重大语言模型的兴起，需要研究遗忘过程本身是否可能被植入后门，即在正常条件下看似成功遗忘，但在特定触发条件下恢复被遗忘的行为。

Method: 利用注意力汇聚现象，将后门触发器放置在模型注意力集中的浅层输入标记位置，并通过调整注意力值来增强后门的持久性。

Result: 实验表明，基于注意力汇聚的后门遗忘攻击能够可靠地在触发器出现时恢复被遗忘的知识，而在无触发器时与正常遗忘模型表现无异。

Conclusion: 注意力汇聚现象为后门遗忘攻击提供了有效途径，揭示了遗忘过程本身的安全脆弱性，需要开发更健壮的遗忘方法来防御此类攻击。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for
removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while
retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we
ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful
under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden
trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that
embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate
backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but
recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing
such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed
and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between
backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens
consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing
triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly
enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,
showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores
forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving
indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

Abstract: We study the Quality of Service Degradation (QoSD) problem, in which an
adversary perturbs edge weights to degrade network performance. This setting
arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where
communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While
classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches
address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior
model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions.
This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that
synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method
includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm
that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with
performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training
paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to
capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement
learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal
solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently
outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with
nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.

Abstract: Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a
foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as
disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in
nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary
signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of
conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore
structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,
to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence
Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the
mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization
(J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by
encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under
reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying
on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity
assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and
offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.

### [339] [The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL-Induced Motivated Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17057)
*Nikolaus Howe,Micah Carroll*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在指令与学习行为冲突时会进行动机推理——生成看似合理的理由来违反指令，同时淡化潜在危害。这种推理可能难以被检测，特别是对于较小的LLM监控器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究当后处理指令与模型已学习行为冲突时，模型的推理过程会发生什么变化，以及这种动机推理对CoT监控的影响。

Method: 在简单设置中研究模型行为，分析模型如何生成看似合理的理由来违反指令，并测试不同规模LLM检测这种动机推理的能力。

Result: 模型会进行系统性动机推理，大多数前沿推理模型能检测到这种推理，但较小的LLM监控器可能无法识别部分动机推理，甚至可能被说服认为这种推理是正确的。

Conclusion: 随着模型变得更复杂，其动机推理可能越来越难以被监控器检测，这凸显了在依赖思维链过程进行模型评估和监督时需要考虑动机推理的重要性。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language
models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a
compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under
the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal
decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors
due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned
tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to
avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's
reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We
investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in
systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications
for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond
being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated
reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges
can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be
persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear
instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more
sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for
monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated
reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and
oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some
examples in this paper may be upsetting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于低精度对数定点训练的新方法，通过硬件友好的分段线性逼近优化对数加法运算，在12位整数运算下实现与32位浮点训练相当的精度，同时显著降低硬件面积和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然量化技术已显著降低深度学习推理的计算成本，但训练仍主要依赖复杂的浮点运算。低精度定点训练是一个有吸引力的替代方案，特别是针对未来硬件加速器设计。

Method: 引入位宽设计到算术运算逼近中，提出硬件友好的分段线性逼近用于对数加法。使用模拟退火算法在不同精度级别优化该逼近，并通过C++位真模拟验证训练效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上，使用12位整数运算训练VGG-11和VGG-16模型，与32位浮点训练相比精度损失最小。硬件研究表明，提出的LNS乘累加单元比线性定点等效单元面积减少32.5%，能耗降低53.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了低精度对数定点训练在保持精度的同时，能显著降低硬件资源需求，为未来高效训练加速器设计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the
computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly
relies on complex floating-point arithmetic. Low-precision fixed-point training
presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in
low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware
accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of
approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new
hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition.
Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different
precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and
VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer
arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point
training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5%
reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units
compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督预训练交互式智能体的方法，使其能够快速模仿人类演示。该方法将目标（观察结果）作为基本构建块，在训练时自动提出目标并练习达成，在评估时通过逆强化学习解释演示行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最成功的AI模型（如VLMs、LLMs）缺乏明确的动作概念，而纯探索方法无法让智能体快速适应新任务。人类数据提供了强归纳偏置，但存在错误假设——人类大部分时间处于最有回报的状态。

Method: 将目标作为原子构造，训练时自动提出目标并练习达成，基于强化学习探索的先前工作。评估时通过逆强化学习将演示解释为最优目标达成行为。

Result: 在标准基准测试（非专为目标达成设计）上，该方法在零样本模仿方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为具身智能体提供了一种自监督预训练方式，使其能够快速适应新任务并模仿人类演示。

Abstract: In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training
in a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in
a self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to
quickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real
world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most
successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion
of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is
well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with
a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation
to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided
by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that
the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a
sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to
solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of
their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a
method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so
that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals
(i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method
automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior
work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method
solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain
demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard
benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms
prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

Motivation: 解决在无法获取真实数据的情况下评估数据集可靠性的问题，特别是处理来自潜在策略性来源的数据时。

Method: 定义基于真实数据的可靠性排序，提出Gram行列式评分来衡量观测数据和实验结果的经验分布向量所张成的体积，证明该评分能保持多种基于真实数据的可靠性排序。

Result: 在合成噪声模型、CIFAR-10嵌入和真实就业数据上的实验表明，Gram行列式评分能有效捕捉不同观测过程中的数据质量。

Conclusion: Gram行列式评分是一种实验无关的可靠性评估方法，能在无法获取真实数据的情况下有效评估数据集质量。

Abstract: How can we assess the reliability of a dataset without access to ground
truth? We introduce the problem of reliability scoring for datasets collected
from potentially strategic sources. The true data are unobserved, but we see
outcomes of an unknown statistical experiment that depends on them. To
benchmark reliability, we define ground-truth-based orderings that capture how
much reported data deviate from the truth. We then propose the Gram determinant
score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical
distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this
score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely
up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of
the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on
synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data
demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality
across diverse observation processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应图学习框架，通过专业专家网络检测金融异常，提供内置可解释性，能够识别异常机制类型并追踪其时间演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测器将所有异常视为同质，产生标量分数而不揭示具体失效机制、风险集中位置或干预方法，这种不透明性阻碍了针对性监管响应。

Method: 通过BiLSTM与自注意力捕获多尺度时间依赖，跨模态注意力融合时空信息，神经多源插值学习动态图，应力调制融合自适应平衡学习动态与结构先验，将异常路由到四个机制特定专家，产生双重可解释归因。

Conclusion: 该框架在异常检测性能和可解释性方面显著优于现有方法，能够自动识别异常机制类型并追踪其时间演化，为监管提供针对性指导。

Abstract: Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity
freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all
anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism
is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents
targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static
graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime
changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across
multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with
network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on
anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.
  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks
that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale
temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and
spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through
neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with
structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four
mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions.
Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied
post-hoc.
  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events
with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley
Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert
weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48
(66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism
identification without labeled supervision.

*Zhiyuan Fan,Arnab Maiti,Kevin Jamieson,Lillian J. Ratliff,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Hedge算法在组合设置中的最优性，证明了Hedge在大多数组合问题中接近最优，但在某些特定设置（如m-集合）中比最优算法差√log d倍，同时展示了其在在线多任务学习中的最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Hedge算法在组合在线学习设置中的最优性，确定其在各种组合问题中的性能界限。

Method: 通过建立下界分析Hedge的最优性，识别特定组合类别（m-集合）进行精确分析，并利用Hedge的接近最优性为DAG中的在线最短路径问题构建最优正则化器。

Result: 证明对于任意X⊆{0,1}^d，Hedge接近最优（最多差√log d倍）；在log d≤m≤√d的m-集合中，Hedge比最优算法差√log d倍；但在在线多任务学习中Hedge是最优的。

Conclusion: Hedge在大多数组合设置中接近最优，但在某些特定设置中存在性能差距，其接近最优性可用于为DAG中的在线最短路径问题构建最优正则化器。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial
settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a
set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t
\rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,
including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask
learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is
well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after
$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal
across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X
\subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log
d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log
d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of
combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for
which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by
a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is
optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical
$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to
establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path
problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial
domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)
algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is
iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret
guarantees for DAGs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在聚合bandit反馈下的在线学习问题，之前的工作只关注最坏情况分析，而本文首次研究能在随机和对抗环境中都表现良好的BOBW算法。

Method: 结合了占用度量的FTRL、自约束技术以及受在线最短路径问题启发的新损失估计器，并扩展到未知转移情况下的置信度技术。

Result: 在已知转移情况下，算法在随机环境中达到O(log T)遗憾，在对抗环境中达到O(√T)遗憾，并建立了匹配的下界。同时为最短路径问题提供了首个个体间隙相关下界。

Conclusion: 成功设计了首个在聚合bandit反馈下的BOBW算法，证明了在已知转移情况下的最优性，并将方法扩展到未知转移设置，为相关领域提供了新的分析工具和结果。

Abstract: We study online learning in finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the challenging aggregate bandit feedback model, where the learner
observes only the cumulative loss incurred in each episode, rather than
individual losses at each state-action pair. While prior work in this setting
has focused exclusively on worst-case analysis, we initiate the study of
best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both
stochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms
for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known
transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings
and ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish
matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this
setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by
incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of
FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators
inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we
also provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate
near-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在时间序列建模中取得了显著成功，但其内部机制仍然不透明，需要揭示其工作原理以提高可解释性。

Method: 建立Transformer编码器与GCN的等价性，将注意力分布矩阵视为动态邻接矩阵，提出Fighter架构去除冗余线性投影并引入多跳图聚合。

Result: 在标准预测基准测试中，Fighter实现了具有竞争力的性能，同时提供了对其预测的更清晰机制可解释性。

Conclusion: Transformer本质上等同于GCN，这一统一理论重新解释为时间序列建模提供了更明确和可解释的表示方法。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet
their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer
encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution
matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with
subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph
convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update
dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters.
Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose
\textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined
architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates
multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and
interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales,
naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting
benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while
providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.

Motivation: 传统自编码器在代码分布控制方面存在不足，需要一种能够确保代码矩阵具有高斯分布特性的正则化方法，以提高模型的泛化性能。

Method: 使用矩阵自由能作为可微损失函数，通过随机梯度下降优化代码矩阵的奇异值分布，使其与独立同分布高斯随机矩阵的奇异值分布一致。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够产生高斯化代码，在训练集和测试集上都具有良好的泛化性能，并能有效应用于欠定逆问题。

Conclusion: 矩阵自由能正则化是一种有效的自编码器正则化方法，能够可靠地产生高斯代码并提升模型在欠定问题中的表现。

Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on
matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in
terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size).
From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss
achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix
coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the
negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based
training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test
sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy
maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its
application to underdetermined inverse problems.

Motivation: 大多数现有强化学习方法都是基于离散时间框架，而现实世界中的控制问题往往是连续时间的。需要开发能够在连续时间框架下保持Q函数动作评估能力的RL方法，而不依赖时间离散化。

Method: 通过鞅条件定义连续时间Q函数，基于动态规划原理将扩散策略得分与学习到的连续Q函数的动作梯度联系起来，提出连续Q分数匹配(CQSM)算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success across a wide
range of domains, however, most existing methods are formulated in discrete
time. In this work, we introduce a novel RL method for continuous-time control,
where stochastic differential equations govern state-action dynamics. Departing
from traditional value function-based approaches, our key contribution is the
characterization of continuous-time Q-functions via a martingale condition and
the linking of diffusion policy scores to the action gradient of a learned
continuous Q-function by the dynamic programming principle. This insight
motivates Continuous Q-Score Matching (CQSM), a score-based policy improvement
algorithm. Notably, our method addresses a long-standing challenge in
continuous-time RL: preserving the action-evaluation capability of Q-functions
without relying on time discretization. We further provide theoretical
closed-form solutions for linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems within our
framework. Numerical results in simulated environments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method and compare it to popular baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的基准来评估LLM通过多轮对话发现和利用隐藏用户属性的能力，结果显示LLM能够发现潜在信息但成功率差异很大（32%-98%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM擅长生成通用文本，但在需要用户特定偏好的场景中，用户很少明确表达所有偏好，大部分信息是潜在的，需要被推断。

Method: 引入三智能体框架（用户、助手、裁判）进行逐轮评估，涵盖三个逐渐现实的设置：20个问题游戏、个性化问答和个性化文本摘要。

Result: LLM确实能够通过对话发现潜在信息，但成功率差异很大，从32%到98%不等，取决于任务复杂性、主题和隐藏属性数量。

Conclusion: 有效的偏好推断仍然是构建真正自适应AI系统的开放前沿，该基准为研究个性化交互中的潜在信息发现提供了首个系统框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but
this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are
required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these
scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much
of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a
fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information
through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating
latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden
user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three
progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized
Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a
tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of
elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed
surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically
with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number
of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework
for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,
highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for
building truly adaptive AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分类器自由引导(CFG)方法在提高图像质量和提示对齐性时导致多样性减少的问题，同时避免现有解耦方法需要额外训练辅助模型的开销。

Method: 使用随机前向传递动态生成次优预测，将引导重新定义为推理时的自我修正过程，无需任何外部组件。

Result: 该方法不仅可行，而且为成本高效的引导建立了强大的新基准，证明无需外部模型即可实现自引导的益处。

Conclusion: In-situ Autoguidance是一种零成本的自引导方法，成功实现了图像质量、多样性和提示对齐性的解耦，无需辅助模型即可达到与现有方法相当的效果。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality, diverse, and prompt-aligned images is a
central goal in image-generating diffusion models. The popular classifier-free
guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced
variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has
successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately
trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the
considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this
prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits
guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach
dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic
forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction.
We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also
establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that
the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习模型部署后固定不变，无法适应动态开放环境中出现的未见类别样本。需要模型能够自主检测这些新样本并在标注后学习它们。

Method: 提出了PLDA方法，该方法在运行时动态执行OOD检测和增量学习新类别，解决了数据稀缺和资源消耗问题。

Result: 经验评估将证明PLDA方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ALMD范式使模型能够在部署后持续学习，适应动态环境中的新类别，PLDA方法为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application,
it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is
inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples
from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be
able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after
they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model
Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human
engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other
knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an
unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection
of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new
classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in
traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised
learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and
incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the
past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered
classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two
challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes
often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and
incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will
demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.

*Guanjie Cheng,Siyang Liu,Junqin Huang,Xinkui Zhao,Yin Wang,Mengying Zhu,Linghe Kong,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALPINE是一个轻量级自适应框架，让终端设备能实时调整差分隐私级别，在移动边缘群智感知系统中平衡隐私保护、数据效用和能耗成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动边缘群智感知系统在动态资源受限环境中持续生成传输用户数据，面临严重隐私威胁。静态差分隐私机制无法适应不断变化的风险（如攻击能力变化、资源约束和任务需求），导致要么噪声过多要么保护不足。

Method: ALPINE作为闭环控制系统包含四个模块：动态风险感知、基于TD3算法的隐私决策、本地隐私执行和边缘节点性能验证。设计了平衡隐私收益、数据效用和能耗成本的奖励函数，指导TD3智能体自适应调整噪声幅度。

Result: 理论分析和真实世界仿真表明，ALPINE能有效缓解推理攻击，同时保持数据效用和控制成本，适用于大规模边缘应用。

Conclusion: ALPINE框架通过自适应差分隐私机制，在动态边缘环境中实现了隐私保护、数据效用和能耗成本之间的动态平衡，具有实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit
user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to
significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms
build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to
adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,
resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise
or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a
lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously
adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a
closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,
privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),
local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on
environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances
privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to
adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a
dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative
risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead
deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations
demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while
preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来评估文本属性图(TAG)学习中GNN和LLM的鲁棒性，揭示了模型在文本和结构扰动间的固有权衡，并提出了SFT-auto框架来提升对抗性环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对图神经网络(GNN)和大语言模型(LLM)在文本属性图(TAG)学习中的鲁棒性评估是碎片化的，缺乏对文本和结构扰动的系统性研究。

Method: 提出了统一的鲁棒性评估框架，在10个数据集上评估经典GNN、鲁棒GNN和GraphLLM在文本、结构和混合扰动下的表现，并开发了SFT-auto框架来平衡文本和结构攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现模型在文本和结构鲁棒性间存在固有权衡，GNN性能高度依赖文本编码器和攻击类型，GraphLLM对训练数据污染特别脆弱。SFT-auto框架在单一模型中实现了对文本和结构攻击的优越且平衡的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为TAG安全研究奠定了基础，并为对抗性环境中的鲁棒TAG学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are
powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a
comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current
evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct
effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and
attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and
comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework
evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten
datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and
hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive
analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly
noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and
structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text
encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to
training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce
SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness
against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work
establishes a foundation for future research on TAG security and offers
practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/Leirunlin/TGRB.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, including
machine-learned dynamics, has outpaced the development of standardized tools
for method validation. Objective comparison between simulation approaches is
often hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of
rare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To
address these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.
Our approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble
Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on
progress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis
(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational
space. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that
supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and
machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a
comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different
metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a
dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a
variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been
extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4
ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests
using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein
conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet
model. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible
comparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork
for consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation
community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOLE是一个软硬件协同设计的Transformer加速方案，通过E2Softmax和AILayerNorm分别优化Softmax和LayerNorm操作，在不重新训练的情况下保持推理精度，同时显著提升速度和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在NLP和CV任务中表现出色，但其实时推理速度和效率受限于Softmax和LayerNorm的低效性。现有基于函数逼近的方法实现效率低，忽视内存开销，且需要重新训练来补偿逼近误差。

Method: 提出SOLE软硬件协同设计：E2Softmax使用指数函数的log2量化和基于对数的除法来逼近Softmax；AILayerNorm采用低精度统计计算。实现Softmax和LayerNorm的低精度计算和低比特位宽存储。

Result: 实验表明SOLE在不重新训练的情况下保持推理精度，相比GPU实现数量级的速度提升和能耗节省。相比现有定制硬件，Softmax和LayerNorm分别实现3.04倍、3.86倍的能效提升和2.82倍、3.32倍的面积效率提升。

Conclusion: SOLE通过软硬件协同设计有效解决了Transformer中Softmax和LayerNorm的效率瓶颈，在保持精度的同时显著提升了推理速度和能效，为Transformer的实时应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have shown remarkable performance in both natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, their real-time
inference speed and efficiency are limited due to the inefficiency in Softmax
and Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). Previous works based on function
approximation suffer from inefficient implementation as they place emphasis on
computation while disregarding memory overhead concerns. Moreover, such methods
rely on retraining to compensate for approximation error which can be costly
and inconvenient.
  In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and
LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm. E2Softmax utilizes
log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division to approximate
Softmax while AILayerNorm adopts low-precision statistic calculation. Compared
with state-of-the-art designs, we achieve both low-precision calculation and
low bit-width storage on Softmax and LayerNorm. Experiments show that SOLE
maintains inference accuracy without retraining while offering orders of
magnitude speedup and energy savings over GPU, achieving 3.04x, 3.86x
energy-efficiency improvements and 2.82x, 3.32x area-efficiency improvements
over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm,
respectively.

TL;DR: 提出软掩码方法改进扩散语言模型，通过动态混合掩码标记与预测标记的嵌入，保留更多预测信息，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型在解码时只做二元选择（保留掩码或替换为预测标记），这会丢弃有价值的预测信息。需要一种能保留部分预测信息的方法来改进模型性能。

Method: 提出软掩码方法，动态混合掩码标记嵌入与上一步预测的前k个标记嵌入，为模型提供更丰富的先验信息。通过适配预训练掩码扩散语言模型来融入软掩码。

Result: 在169M参数模型上继续预训练软掩码方法后，困惑度和MAUVE分数得到改善。在Dream-7B和Dream-Coder-7B模型上微调后，在多个编程基准测试中性能一致提升，特别是在高吞吐量设置下。

Conclusion: 软掩码方法有效解决了传统掩码扩散模型的信息丢弃问题，通过保留部分预测信息显著提升了语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling,
offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their
ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster
generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based
language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively
processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask
or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards
valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this
limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically
blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$
predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This
provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from
earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to
propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a
pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate
that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved
perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art
diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently
improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in
high-throughput settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出针对高风险高回报任务的强化学习框架，通过离散化连续动作空间、熵正则化探索和双评论家架构来处理多模态动作分布和随机回报问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法假设单峰高斯策略和标量评论家，在高风险高回报任务中效果有限，因为这类任务通常具有多模态动作分布和随机回报特性。

Method: 离散化连续动作空间以近似多模态分布，使用熵正则化探索提高风险但高回报动作的覆盖度，引入双评论家架构进行更准确的离散值分布估计。

Result: 在具有高失败风险的移动和操作基准测试中，该方法优于基线方法，证明了显式建模多模态性和风险的重要性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够扩展到高维动作空间，支持复杂控制领域，为高风险高回报任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle
crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns.
Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and
rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR
settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian
policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this,
we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous
action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs
entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding
actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate
discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to
high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments
on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure
demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance
of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

Result: AttEnc在三个数据集上分别达到99.3%、99.0%和99.9%的识别准确率，预测时间加快44%-79%，平均减少87.6%模型参数；P-AttEnc在单样本场景下识别准确率为69.8%，对未知驾驶员的平均分类准确率为65.7%。

Conclusion: 提出的AttEnc和P-AttEnc架构在驾驶员识别任务中表现出色，既能高效识别已知驾驶员，又能处理数据短缺和未知驾驶员分类问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Driver identification has become an area of increasing interest in recent
years, especially for data- driven applications, because biometric-based
technologies may incur privacy issues. This study proposes a deep learning
neural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an
attention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters
than current methods. Most studies do not address the issue of data shortages
for driver identification, and most of them are inflexible when encountering
unknown drivers. In this study, an architecture that combines a prototypical
network and an attention-based encoder (P-AttEnc) is proposed. It applies
few-shot learning to overcome the data shortage issues and to enhance model
generalizations. The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can
identify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different
datasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it
significantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters. P-AttEnc
identifies drivers based on few shot data, extracts driver fingerprints to
address the issue of data shortages, and is able to classify unknown drivers.
The first experiment showed that P-AttEnc can identify drivers with an accuracy
of 69.8% in the one-shot scenario. The second experiment showed that P-AttEnc,
in the 1-shot scenario, can classify unknown drivers with an average accuracy
of 65.7%.

Conclusion: ADCMs框架为一致性模型提供了自动和自适应离散化解决方案，显著提升了训练效率和性能

Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have shown promise for efficient one-step
generation. However, most existing CMs rely on manually designed discretization
schemes, which can cause repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and
datasets. To address this, we propose a unified framework for the automatic and
adaptive discretization of CMs, formulating it as an optimization problem with
respect to the discretization step. Concretely, during the consistency training
process, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to
ensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global
consistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising
error in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and
global consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we
achieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer
to our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly
improve the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative
performance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
Moreover, ADCMs exhibit strong adaptability to more advanced DM variants. Code

TL;DR: ControlValve是一种新的防御机制，通过生成允许的控制流图并在执行时强制执行这些图来防止多智能体系统中的控制流劫持攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于对齐检查的防御机制（如LlamaFirewall）无法有效防止控制流劫持攻击，因为安全和功能目标存在根本冲突，且对齐定义脆弱、检查器对执行环境的可见性不完整。

Method: ControlValve生成多智能体系统的允许控制流图，并在执行时强制执行这些图，同时为每个智能体调用生成零样本的上下文规则。

Result: ControlValve能够有效防御控制流劫持攻击，解决了现有防御机制的局限性。

Conclusion: ControlValve通过控制流完整性和最小权限原则，为多智能体系统提供了更强大的安全防御机制。

Abstract: Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in
multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system
and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as
LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure
that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the
original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these
defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that
the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally
conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle
definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the
execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired
by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve
(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)
enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual
rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.

Result: 实验表明现有最先进基线的有效性和效率远未达到满意水平。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为未来LLM记忆和优化算法的研究铺平了道路，强调了在真实服务场景中从用户反馈持续学习的重要性。

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the
mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are
almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal
gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the
abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice,
constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an
important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing
benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous
reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their
abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore,
we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark
covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the
continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness
and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we
hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and
optimization algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论主要关注紧致群对称性且假设数据分布不变，这在现实应用中很少满足。本文旨在扩展对称性理论保证到更一般的非紧致对称性和非不变数据分布场景。

Method: 基于PAC-Bayes框架，作者改进并收紧现有边界，特别以McAllester的PAC-Bayes边界为例，展示了该方法适用于广泛的PAC-Bayes边界。

Result: 在具有非均匀旋转群的旋转MNIST数据集上的实验验证了理论，推导出的保证不仅成立，而且优于先前结果。

Conclusion: 对于对称数据，对称模型在超越紧致群和不变分布限制的更广泛场景中具有优势，这为理解机器学习中对称性提供了更一般的理论基础。

Abstract: Symmetries are known to improve the empirical performance of machine learning
models, yet theoretical guarantees explaining these gains remain limited. Prior
work has focused mainly on compact group symmetries and often assumes that the
data distribution itself is invariant, an assumption rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. In this work, we extend generalization guarantees to
the broader setting of non-compact symmetries, such as translations and to
non-invariant data distributions. Building on the PAC-Bayes framework, we adapt
and tighten existing bounds, demonstrating the approach on McAllester's
PAC-Bayes bound while showing that it applies to a wide range of PAC-Bayes
bounds. We validate our theory with experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with
a non-uniform rotation group, where the derived guarantees not only hold but
also improve upon prior results. These findings provide theoretical evidence
that, for symmetric data, symmetric models are preferable beyond the narrow
setting of compact groups and invariant distributions, opening the way to a
more general understanding of symmetries in machine learning.

Conclusion: 这些贡献为推进多因子时序解缠结提供了稳健且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in
deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While
real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior
work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,
primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby
overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce
the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential
disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time
series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model
development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We
additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align
latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model
that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language
Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement
evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.
Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for
advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于评估准则的奖励建模框架，通过两阶段方法实现数据高效和可解释性，仅需少量偏好数据即可获得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型依赖昂贵的偏好数据集且缺乏可解释性，基于准则的方法虽透明但缺乏系统质量控制和优化，需要在可扩展性和可靠性之间权衡。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 通过验证引导的Propose-Evaluate-Revise管道推断高质量查询特定准则；2) 通过最大化信息论编码率将细粒度准则泛化为紧凑的核心集，形成可解释的分层"主题-提示"准则集。

Result: 仅使用70个偏好对（源数据的1.5%），该方法使Qwen3-8B等较小模型超越专门的全训练模型，展现了卓越的数据效率和性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作开创了可扩展、可解释且数据高效的奖励建模路径，为LLM与人类价值观对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets
and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer
transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization,
creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these
limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption:
\textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant
generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables
remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality,
query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided
\textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these
granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an
\textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an
interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance.
Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our
method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized,
fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and
data-efficient path for reward modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LLM在可解释性和性能之间的权衡问题，为需要透明性和能力的受监管领域提供支持。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计、动态规则注入和基于惩罚似然的招募标准，通过层次化招募机制实现多粒度架构适应。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，同时在多个粒度上适应架构容量，支持需要透明性和能力的应用场景。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an
information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic
blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at
initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends
capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity
architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on
attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule
injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood
with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing
explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on
semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on
attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism
provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained,
within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the
system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data
encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously
interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting
architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in
regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

TL;DR: 本文通过生成图神经网络的"metamers"（在模型表示空间中等效但在结构和节点特征上显著不同的图）来研究GNN的表示不变性，发现经典GNN架构存在极端的不变性水平，且现有改进方法无法达到人类水平的不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究图神经网络中的不变性行为，探索人工神经网络与人类大脑在不变性机制上的差距，特别是在图数据领域。

Method: 引入metamers生成技术，通过优化输入图使其内部节点激活与参考图匹配，从而获得在模型表示空间中等效但结构和节点特征不同的图。理论分析包括局部metamer维度和metamer流形的激活诱导体积变化。

Result: 在多个经典GNN架构中发现了极端的表示不变性水平；虽然通过调整模型架构和训练策略可以部分缓解这种过度不变性，但无法从根本上弥合与人类不变性的差距；量化了metamer图与原始图的偏差，揭示了当前GNN的独特失败模式。

Conclusion: 当前图神经网络存在过度不变性问题，与人类的不变性机制存在显著差距，需要新的方法来更好地模拟人类的感知不变性。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in
perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to
emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies
in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain
between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of
humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks
(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing
input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a
reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's
representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node
features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer
dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the
metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of
representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although
targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can
partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge
the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between
metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes
of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.

Conclusion: 物理信息神经网络可以有效解决强化学习在智能电网优化中的样本效率问题，显著加速策略训练过程。

Abstract: Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents
significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems
and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of
Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively
throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means
obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a
sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by
substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using
Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training
process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by
the original environment.

TL;DR: 提出DISC方法，利用扩散模型的多层次去噪过程提取丰富的多维特征向量，不仅能检测OOD数据，还能区分OOD类型，超越传统标量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OOD检测方法将分布偏移压缩为单一标量异常分数，无法区分OOD数据类型，限制了后续的上下文理解和利用。

Method: DISC利用扩散模型的迭代去噪过程，在多个噪声水平上提取统计差异特征，形成多维特征向量。

Result: 在图像和表格基准测试中，DISC在OOD检测性能上达到或超越SOTA方法，并具备OOD类型分类能力。

Conclusion: DISC实现了从简单二元OOD检测到更细粒度检测的转变，为OOD数据的上下文理解和利用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is critical for machine learning, be
it for safety reasons or to enable open-ended learning. However, beyond mere
detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the
type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not
distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse
distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that
scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly
contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the
introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC
leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a
rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies
across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular
benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for
OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely
absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary
OOD detection to a more granular detection.

<details>

Motivation: 研究生成视觉模型内部表征的演变，特别是从GANs和VAEs到扩散模型的转变，旨在理解这些模型如何分布表征负担并挑战统一内部空间的假设。

Method: 通过模型架构的详细分析和在层级表征中进行干预的实验设置，展示了扩散模型如何分散表征负担。

Result: 扩散模型将表征负担分散到不同层，挑战了统一内部空间的假设，表明生成过程是专门化过程的涌现配置。

Conclusion: 生成AI应被重新理解为专门化过程的涌现配置，而非内容的直接合成，这有助于更准确地理解生成模型的内部工作机制。

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in
generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from
GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's
account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we
propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact
latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a
broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is
distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a
targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we
show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby
challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings
within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such
as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a
reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of
content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabR1是首个用于表格预测的推理大语言模型，通过Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO)方法激活LLMs的推理能力，在少样本和零样本场景下实现与强基线相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格预测方法（梯度提升决策树和专用深度学习模型）缺乏可解释性和跨任务迁移能力，而推理LLMs虽然具有跨任务适应性和透明推理能力，但在表格数据上的潜力尚未充分开发。

Method: 提出PRPO方法，通过构建每个样本的多个标签保持排列，并在排列内部和跨排列估计优势，将稀疏奖励转化为密集学习信号，编码列排列不变性作为结构先验。

Result: TabR1在全监督微调下达到与强基线相当的性能；在零样本设置下接近32样本设置的强基线性能；TabR1 (8B)在各种任务上显著优于更大的LLMs，相比DeepSeek-R1 (685B)提升达53.17%。

Conclusion: TabR1通过PRPO方法成功激活了LLMs在表格预测中的推理能力，在性能、泛化性和可解释性方面均有显著提升，为表格预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision
trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but
provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning
large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent
reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular
data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction
with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy
Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that
encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing
multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages
both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense
learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO
activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing
few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong
baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1
approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.
Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various
tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机化赌博机算法通常存在计算效率低和理论遗憾界较高的问题，需要一种既能保持理论最优性又具有计算效率的新方法。

Method: 特征扰动技术：不在参数空间采样，而是直接在特征输入中注入随机性，适用于广义线性模型和非参数模型。

Result: 实现了$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$的最坏情况遗憾界，优于现有随机化算法的$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 特征扰动技术统一了强实践性能和最优理论保证，是广义线性赌博机的高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose feature perturbation, a simple yet powerful technique that injects
randomness directly into feature inputs, instead of randomizing unknown
parameters or adding noise to rewards. Remarkably, this algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret bound for generalized linear
bandits, while avoiding the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret
typical of existing randomized bandit algorithms. Because our algorithm eschews
parameter sampling, it is both computationally efficient and naturally extends
to non-parametric or neural network models. We verify these advantages through
empirical evaluations, demonstrating that feature perturbation not only
surpasses existing methods but also unifies strong practical performance with
best-known theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平均奖励离线强化学习方法依赖严格假设（如遍历性或线性MDP），而弱通信MDP假设更为温和，需要开发更通用的方法。

Method: 提出锚定拟合Q迭代方法，将标准拟合Q迭代与锚定机制结合，锚定可解释为权重衰减形式，支持有限时间分析。

Result: 建立了弱通信MDP下平均奖励离线RL的样本复杂度结果，锚定机制对实现有限时间分析至关重要，并扩展到单轨迹数据集场景。

Conclusion: 锚定机制是实现平均奖励离线RL有限时间分析的关键创新，为弱通信MDP提供了首个样本复杂度保证。

Abstract: Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample
complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior
work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention,
and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or
linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity
results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly
communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce
Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration
with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as
a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the
average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup
where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID
transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态神经网络训练中存在模态过拟合问题，即网络过度依赖某个模态，导致性能不佳，限制了多模态学习的潜力。

Method: MILES利用训练过程中模态条件利用率差异，动态调整学习率，平衡各模态的学习速度，实现更均衡的多模态学习。

Result: 在四个多模态联合融合任务上评估，MILES优于七个最先进的基线方法，在所有任务和融合方法中都表现最佳，有效平衡了模态使用。

Conclusion: 平衡多模态学习对提升模型性能具有重要影响，MILES方法能够改善多模态性能并产生更强的模态编码器，适用于单模态样本或缺失模态的情况。

Abstract: The aim of multimodal neural networks is to combine diverse data sources,
referred to as modalities, to achieve enhanced performance compared to relying
on a single modality. However, training of multimodal networks is typically
hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one
of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,
hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal
improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the
Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint
fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in
modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively
balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during
training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal
model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal
predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion
tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion
methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during
training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality
encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent
modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal
learning on improving model performance.

Conclusion: RINS-T为解决复杂现实世界时间序列挑战提供了一个灵活有效的解决方案，其创新技术显著增强了框架的优化稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as
missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for
tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues,
inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted
data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep
learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require
extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In
this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series
Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high
recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages
neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization
techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on
Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and
robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,
input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these
contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and
robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution
for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available

Motivation: 传统ECG分析方法难以同时捕捉全局趋势和局部波形特征的高时间分辨率交互，需要一种能够桥接全局和局部信号分析的方法。

Method: 引入S4ECG架构，利用结构化状态空间模型进行多时段心律失常分类，通过联合多时段预测来提升性能。

Result: 多时段预测方法比单时段方法在宏观AUROC上提升1.0-11.6%，房颤特异性从0.718-0.979提升至0.967-0.998，在分布内和分布外鲁棒性方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了心律失常检测算法向时间感知范式的转变，为ECG解释特别是复杂心律失常如房颤和房扑开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with
continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and
pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven
challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local
waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal
resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a
novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for
multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions
significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC,
with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998,
demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced
out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal
temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This
work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia
detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in
particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Conclusion: CDUA提供了准确的容量估计和可靠的不确定性量化，比较实验进一步验证了其鲁棒性和优于现有主流方法的性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated
uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains
challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel
method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which
integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The
proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series
forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive
performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle
operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the
Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are
used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a
contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies,
and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy
observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data
demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,
with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results
confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable
uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its
robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.

diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled
dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful
diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness
prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often
necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To
address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes
representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real
data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as
guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the
representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive
experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets,
demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating
high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture
generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between
diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a
practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled
dataset.

Result: 在同质性和异质性图上的广泛实验显示GBN具有强大的表达能力，即使网络深度超过256层也不会出现性能下降

Conclusion: GBN通过局部方法有效解决了MPNN的过平滑和过压缩问题，在深度网络中保持稳定性能

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) is the building block of graph
foundation models, but fundamentally suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing. There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both
issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be
beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the
suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing
through a global measure -- spectral gap $\lambda$ -- and prove that the
increase of $\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input
features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated
by such theoretical insights, we propose a \textbf{local} approach that
adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this,
we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel
nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with
local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive
experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of
GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the
network depth exceeds $256$ layers.

TL;DR: 本研究应用可解释AI技术（Grad-CAM和SHAP）来解释PhaseNet地震事件检测模型的决策过程，并基于这些解释开发了SHAP门控推理方案，提高了模型性能和可靠性。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络如PhaseNet在地震事件检测中表现出高精度，但其黑盒特性在关键应用中存在担忧，需要提高模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: 使用Grad-CAM可视化网络注意力，SHAP量化特征贡献，并开发了SHAP门控推理方案，将模型输出与基于解释的指标相结合以减少错误。

Result: 在9,000个波形测试集上，SHAP门控模型达到F1分数0.98（精度0.99，召回率0.97），优于基线PhaseNet（F1分数0.97），并表现出更强的抗噪鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI不仅能解释深度学习模型，还能直接提升其性能，为构建可信的自动化地震探测器提供了模板。

Abstract: Deep neural networks like PhaseNet show high accuracy in detecting
microseismic events, but their black-box nature is a concern in critical
applications. We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive
Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve
its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with
P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming
that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal
components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that
combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors.
On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of
0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet
(F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results
show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly
enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated
seismic detectors.

Abstract: Current research in Electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics mainly emphasizes
resting-state conditions, leaving the performance decline in rest-exercise

CrossStateECG, achieving an identification accuracy of 92.50% in the
Rest-to-Exercise scenario (training on resting ECG and testing on post-exercise
ECG) and 94.72% in the Exercise-to-Rest scenario (training on post-exercise ECG

Additional validations on the ECG-ID and MIT-BIH datasets further confirmed the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在未训练序列上表现出的组合推理能力，探索其归因于上下文学习和技能组合的现象。

Method: 使用随机层次模型(RHM)作为概率上下文无关语法生成序列，在序列子集上训练模型，并在四种泛化条件下评估：记忆、分布内泛化、分布外泛化（相同规则）和跨层迁移。

Result: 性能随任务复杂性和上下文示例数量系统提升，分布外任务需要比分布内场景更多的示例；训练过程中出现层专业化，与泛化性能相关；PCA和注意力模式聚类显示Transformer在专门层中发展出结构化、层次化组织的表示。

Conclusion: Transformer发展出支持组合推理的模块化、可解释机制，内部算法结构与行为能力相关联。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during
training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill
composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model
(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through
recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and
evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution
generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and
cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with
task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution
tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.
Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization
during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal
component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers
develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized
layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,
interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal
algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

Conclusion: DAMSDAN框架通过动态源域加权和细粒度语义对齐，有效提升了跨域EEG情绪识别的性能，消融实验和可解释性分析验证了方法的有效性

Abstract: Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of
EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core
challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional
heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to
reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency
to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware
multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates
prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder
toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware
source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically
estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition,
a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label
interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level,
fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift.
Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\%
for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the
large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive
ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.

Motivation: 由于非心源性炎症模式、间质性肺病和健康肺部的高度视觉变异性，区分心源性肺水肿与非心源性肺部疾病在肺超声视频中具有挑战性。

Method: 引入ZACH-ViT（零标记自适应紧凑分层视觉变换器），移除位置嵌入和[CLS]标记，实现完全排列不变性；提出ShuffleStrides数据增强技术，在保持解剖有效性的同时打乱探头视图序列和帧顺序。

Result: 在380个肺超声视频上的评估显示，ZACH-ViT获得最高的验证和测试ROC-AUC（0.80和0.79），具有平衡的敏感性（0.60）和特异性（0.91），而所有竞争模型都崩溃为平凡分类。

Conclusion: 将架构设计与数据结构对齐可以在小数据医学成像中超越规模效应，支持实时临床部署。

Abstract: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),
which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving
anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform
scale in small-data medical imaging.

Motivation: 地下决策成本高且不确定性大，获取新数据难以扩展。将地质知识直接嵌入预测模型提供了有价值的替代方案，过程模型可以帮助训练生成模型以提高预测效率。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络(GAN)训练河流沉积物生成模型，并应用四种反演方法来匹配井和地震数据。通过标签条件化、潜在空间过参数化以及微调GAN来重构潜在空间。

Result: 四种反演方法在4、8、20口井的三个测试样本中难以匹配井数据，特别是当井数增加或测试样本与训练数据差异较大时。微调GAN可以显著减少不匹配，达到可接受水平。

Conclusion: GAN已经能够处理地质建模工作流程所需的任务，但仍需进一步评估其鲁棒性，以及如何最好地利用它们来支持地质解释。

Abstract: High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as
acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly
into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables
just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train
generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning
algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be
inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to
three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,
especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the
training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it
is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not
necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent
overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during
training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning
the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to
acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this
approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which
influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can
already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling
workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best
leverage them in support of geological interpretation.

Conclusion: 矩阵分解方法能够显著改进去中心化学习中的差分隐私会计，为开发新的隐私保护算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors
in a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability
and its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy
guarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with
results showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across
peer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility
trade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to
limitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show
that recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization
(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By
generalizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL
algorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields
tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a
principled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce
MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that
outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.

Conclusion: 局部几何分析为诊断和设计深度神经网络提供了基础，将优化几何与功能行为联系起来，为改进网络架构和训练稳定性提供实用见解

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for analyzing neural networks through the lens of
layer-wise Hessian matrices. The local Hessian of each functional block (layer)
is defined as the matrix of second derivatives of a scalar function with
respect to the parameters of that layer. This concept provides a formal tool
for characterizing the local geometry of the parameter space. We show that the
spectral properties of local Hessians, such as the distribution of eigenvalues,
reveal quantitative patterns associated with overfitting,
underparameterization, and expressivity in neural network architectures. We
conduct an extensive empirical study involving 111 experiments across 37
datasets. The results demonstrate consistent structural regularities in the
evolution of local Hessians during training and highlight correlations between
their spectra and generalization performance. These findings establish a
foundation for using local geometric analysis to guide the diagnosis and design
of deep neural networks. The proposed framework connects optimization geometry
with functional behavior and offers practical insight for improving network
architectures and training stability.

Abstract: Stochastic difference-of-convex (DC) optimization is prevalent in numerous
machine learning applications, yet its convergence properties under small batch
sizes remain poorly understood. Existing methods typically require large
batches or strong noise assumptions, which limit their practical use. In this
work, we show that momentum enables convergence under standard smoothness and

that without momentum, convergence may fail regardless of stepsize,
highlighting its necessity. Our momentum-based algorithm achieves provable
convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Motivation: 传统优化理论只保证小学习率下梯度下降的单调收敛，但神经网络训练常在大学习率下进行，表现出非单调下降和对平坦极小值的隐式偏好，这种现象需要理论解释。

Method: 利用过参数化使全局极小值形成黎曼流形，将梯度下降动态分解为平行和正交于流形的分量，分别对应黎曼梯度下降和分叉动力系统。

Result: 识别了三种收敛机制：亚临界状态经历有限时间不稳定后线性收敛到次优平坦极小值；临界状态持续不稳定但以幂律收敛到最优平坦极小值；超临界状态持续不稳定但线性收敛到周期2轨道。

Conclusion: 过参数化使梯度下降在大学习率下表现出复杂的分叉行为，这解释了边缘稳定性现象中非单调收敛和对平坦极小值的偏好。

Abstract: Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for
gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable", regime.
In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a
large step size regime called the ``edge of stability", in which the objective
decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima.
In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing
convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an
overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is
that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers
forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD
dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component
corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while
the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows
us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning
rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is
overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global
minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time
with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)
the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with
linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat
global minimum.

Abstract: Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively
remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that
create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are
better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly
understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental
problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph
limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the
infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse
neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as
networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of
different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and
provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon
representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to
study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit.
Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse
networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK
correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the
varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework
provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the
trainability of various sparse network architectures.

Method: 分析帕金森病症状学，建立与驾驶性能下降的因果关系；整合多车辆控制组件数据构建行为档案；设计基于注意力的网络自适应优先处理时空特征。

Result: 在Logitech G29平台和CARLA模拟器上验证，使用三个道路地图模拟真实驾驶，SAFE-D在区分正常和帕金森病影响驾驶模式方面达到96.8%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: SAFE-D框架能有效检测帕金森病相关的驾驶行为异常，为提升驾驶安全提供了新方法。

Abstract: A driver's health state serves as a determinant factor in driving behavioral
regulation. Subtle deviations from normalcy can lead to operational anomalies,
posing risks to public transportation safety. While prior efforts have
developed detection mechanisms for functionally-driven temporary anomalies such
as drowsiness and distraction, limited research has addressed
pathologically-triggered deviations, especially those stemming from chronic
medical conditions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of
Parkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for
detecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our
methodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease
symptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal
links to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral
variations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data
from multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then
design an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal
features, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.
Finally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator,
using data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving. Our results show
SAFE-D achieves 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and
Parkinson-affected driving patterns.

*Canran Xiao,Chuangxin Zhao,Zong Ke,Fei Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CD-GTMLL框架，将多标签学习建模为合作潜在博弈，通过好奇心奖励机制解决长尾不平衡问题，在稀有标签上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签学习中存在长尾不平衡问题：少数头部标签主导梯度信号，而实践中重要的许多稀有标签被忽视。

Method: 将标签空间分配给多个合作玩家，玩家共享全局准确率收益，同时根据标签稀有性和玩家间分歧获得额外好奇心奖励，无需手动调整类别权重。

Result: 在传统基准和三个超大规模数据集上实现最先进性能，Rare-F1提升达+4.3%，P@3提升+1.6%，消融实验显示出现分工现象和稀有类别上更快的共识。

Conclusion: CD-GTMLL为多标签预测中的长尾鲁棒性提供了一种原则性、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-tail imbalance is endemic to multi-label learning: a few head labels
dominate the gradient signal, while the many rare labels that matter in
practice are silently ignored. We tackle this problem by casting the task as a
cooperative potential game. In our Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label
Learning (CD-GTMLL) framework, the label space is split among several
cooperating players that share a global accuracy payoff yet earn additional
curiosity rewards that rise with label rarity and inter-player disagreement.
These curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without
hand-tuned class weights. We prove that gradient best-response updates ascend a
differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points that
tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Extensive experiments on
conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent
state-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the
strongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and
faster consensus on rare classes. CD-GTMLL thus offers a principled, scalable
route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

TL;DR: 提出Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD)框架，通过生成多样反事实样本来解决深度学习中虚假相关性问题，无需组标签即可实现跨组平衡泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型容易受虚假相关性影响，现有方法如DFR依赖显式组标签且面临组标签缺失、组内样本少、多虚假相关性导致组分裂等问题。

Method: 使用反事实解释器生成多样反事实样本，通过知识蒸馏步骤让人类标注者高效探索和修正模型决策边界，无需混淆变量标签即可丰富欠采样组数据。

Result: 在五个数据集上验证有效，特别在低数据量和高虚假相关性场景表现优异，能扩展到多混淆变量并实现跨组平衡泛化。

Conclusion: CFKD通过反事实知识蒸馏有效解决虚假相关性问题，无需组标签且能处理多混淆变量，在工业应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning models remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, leading to
so-called Clever Hans predictors that undermine robustness even in large-scale
foundation and self-supervised models. Group distributional robustness methods,
such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to
upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels
are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the
subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple
spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose
Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these
issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to
efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a
knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the
undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method
does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple
confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate
CFKD's efficacy across five datasets, spanning synthetic tasks to an industrial
application, with particularly strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced
spurious correlations. Additionally, we provide an ablation study on the effect
of the chosen counterfactual explainer and teacher model, highlighting their
impact on robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在低信噪比数据场景下，引入标签噪声到梯度下降训练中可以抑制噪声记忆化，改善神经网络泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易在训练集中同时学习统计信号和过拟合噪声，特别是在低信噪比(SNR)场景下，噪声记忆化会损害泛化性能。受标签噪声提供隐式正则化的启发，研究是否在梯度更新中引入标签噪声能提升神经网络在低SNR下的测试性能

Method: 在理想化的信号-噪声数据设置中，使用带有标签噪声的梯度下降(GD)算法训练两层神经网络

Result: 证明添加标签噪声能抑制噪声记忆化，防止其主导学习过程；标签噪声GD能实现快速信号增长同时控制过拟合，在低SNR下获得良好泛化。相比之下，标准GD在相同低SNR设置下倾向于过拟合噪声，其测试误差存在非零下界

Conclusion: 在基于梯度的训练中引入标签噪声是有益的，特别是在低信噪比场景下能有效改善神经网络的泛化性能

Abstract: The capacity of deep learning models is often large enough to both learn the
underlying statistical signal and overfit to noise in the training set. This
noise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior
observations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves
generalization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to
the gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in
the low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a
simple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized
signal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training
suppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning
process; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the
overfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite
the low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends
to overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing
lower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing
label noise in gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于保形对齐的边缘-云级联机制，确保边缘预测集在指定概率下包含真实标签，同时显著减少向云端的卸载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘智能通过紧凑的端侧模型实现低延迟推理，但保证可靠性仍然具有挑战性。需要确保边缘预测集在条件覆盖方面达到云端模型的水平。

Method: 引入基于保形对齐的级联机制，将边缘到云端的升级建模为多重假设检验问题，使用保形对齐来选择可以在边缘安全处理的输入。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类和TeleQnA问答基准测试中，CAb级联在保持目标条件覆盖的同时，显著减少了向云端的卸载，预测集大小仅有适度增加。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘预测提供了统计保证，在覆盖度、延迟率和集合大小之间实现了可调权衡，有效提升了边缘推理的可靠性。

Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models,
but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that
must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set,
it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if
produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to
the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based
(CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over
the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a
multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA)
to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb
model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of
edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure
applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal
prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate,
and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA
question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains
the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially
reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in
prediction-set size.

TL;DR: TrajMamba是一种用于车辆GPS轨迹学习的新方法，通过联合建模GPS和道路视角来捕获移动模式，集成旅行目的到嵌入中，并使用知识蒸馏减少轨迹冗余点，在效率和准确性上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TrajMamba能够高效地学习语义丰富的车辆轨迹表示，解决了轨迹数据建模中的计算负担和冗余点问题，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable
travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning
travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world
applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges.
First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and
points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in
textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to
modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which
harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address
these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and
semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a
Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS
and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of
continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware
Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings
without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce
redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation
Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask
generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that
TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and
accuracy.

Motivation: 当前时间序列异常检测指标存在局限性，只能捕捉任务的狭窄方面且常产生误导性结果，这可能导致安全关键系统中的灾难性故障。

Method: 引入可验证属性来形式化评估时间序列异常检测的基本要求，建立理论框架支持原则性评估和可靠比较，分析现有指标并设计新指标。

Result: 分析显示大多数现有指标只满足少数属性，没有一个满足所有属性，这解释了先前结果中的持续不一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的LARM和ALARM指标能够满足所有验证属性，填补了现有评估指标的空白。

Abstract: Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in
safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid
outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance
remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task
and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing
verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating
time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework
that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37
widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none
satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close
this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all
properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter
requirements.

Motivation: 在安全关键领域，拉格朗日方法是处理约束优化问题的常用方法，但其效果严重依赖于拉格朗日乘子的选择。目前缺乏关于自动更新乘子鲁棒性及其对性能影响的实证证据。

Method: 通过分析多个任务中拉格朗日乘子的最优性和稳定性，提供λ-profile可视化优化问题中回报与约束成本之间的权衡关系，并研究自动乘子更新和PID控制更新的效果。

Conclusion: 拉格朗日乘子在安全强化学习中表现出高度敏感性，自动更新方法具有潜力但存在稳定性问题，需要进一步研究稳定化方法。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems,
constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be
carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning
provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being
a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially
depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the
trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update
the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in
practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an
automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we
analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe
reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles
that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and
constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly
sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general
intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally
show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even
exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference
in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier
updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated
through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to
achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need
for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement
learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at

Conclusion: 通过降维压缩潜在空间并结合物理化学属性组织，可以改进抗菌肽设计的优化效率和可解释性。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat
bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult
because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep
generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in
peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a
continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to
great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of
interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a
search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design
space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the
interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with
physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing
antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via
dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with
more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality
reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the
latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different
percentages of available labels.

Conclusion: CEPerFed通过协调本地和全局优化以及减少通信开销，成功解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性和通信效率问题。

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical
practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for
multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various
medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing
across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to
address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect
of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large
numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these
challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL
method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating
client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to
coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the
contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,
while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global
optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data
distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a
hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical
information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be
released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

Motivation: 自杀预测是预防的关键，但真实数据中阳性样本稀少导致极端类别不平衡，需要数据增强技术来改善模型性能。

Method: 使用多种机器学习模型（逻辑回归、随机森林、支持向量机）和深度学习技术（生成对抗网络GAN）来生成合成数据样本增强数据集。

Result: 在真实测试数据上，逻辑回归的加权精度0.99、召回率0.85、F1分数0.91；随机森林分别为0.98、0.99、0.99；支持向量机为0.99、0.76、0.86。LR和SVM正确识别了自杀企图案例（敏感度1.0），RF未识别任何自杀企图案例（敏感度0.0）。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了模型的有效性，GAN在生成合成数据以支持自杀预防建模工作中发挥了关键作用。

Abstract: Suicide prediction is the key for prevention, but real data with sufficient
positive samples is rare and causes extreme class imbalance. We utilized
machine learning (ML) to build the model and deep learning (DL) techniques,
like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to generate synthetic data samples
to enhance the dataset. The initial dataset contained 656 samples, with only
four positive cases, prompting the need for data augmentation. A variety of
machine learning models, ranging from interpretable data models to black box
algorithmic models, were used. On real test data, Logistic Regression (LR)
achieved a weighted precision of 0.99, a weighted recall of 0.85, and a
weighted F1 score of 0.91; Random Forest (RF) showed 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99,
respectively; and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 0.99, 0.76, and 0.86.
LR and SVM correctly identified one suicide attempt case (sensitivity:1.0) and
misclassified LR(20) and SVM (31) non-attempts as attempts (specificity: 0.85 &
0.76, respectively). RF identified 0 suicide attempt cases (sensitivity: 0.0)
with 0 false positives (specificity: 1.0). These results highlight the models'
effectiveness, with GAN playing a key role in generating synthetic data to
support suicide prevention modeling efforts.

Conclusion: 建立了一个实用且资源高效的框架，使基础模型能够快速适应特定用户需求，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低计算和标注成本。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by
detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot
performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often
compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical
downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish
between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their
embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user
goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.
To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad
generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot
classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate
high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high
precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of
user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery
annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning
strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME
identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision
boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample
diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without
costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then
a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our
method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,
establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting
foundation models to specific user needs.

Conclusion: 语言在环框架成功地将自然语言反馈集成到贝叶斯优化中，提供了更灵活和有效的优化方法。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating
complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization
objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large
language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural
language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.
Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and
requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach
leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility
signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel
design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and
principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method
not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also
outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in
feedback-limited regimes.

*Xihong Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了三种主要贡献：CADP算法连接策略梯度和动态规划，建立了ERM Bellman算子的收缩条件并提出了相关算法，以及开发了用于风险规避目标的模型无关Q学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决马尔可夫决策过程中模型不确定性和风险规避的问题，特别是在动态规划、策略优化和风险敏感强化学习方面的理论和方法创新。

Method: 方法包括：1) 提出CADP算法迭代调整模型权重；2) 建立ERM Bellman算子的收缩条件并设计值迭代、策略迭代和线性规划算法；3) 开发模型无关的Q学习算法处理风险规避目标。

Result: 结果证明了CADP算法能保证单调策略改进到局部最优，ERM Bellman算子的收缩条件，以及Q学习算法对ERM-TRC和EVaR-TRC风险规避目标的最优收敛性。

Conclusion: 结论是成功建立了策略梯度与动态规划的新联系，解决了风险敏感强化学习中的关键理论问题，并提出了有效的算法框架用于计算最优风险规避策略。

Abstract: This dissertation makes three main contributions. First, We identify a new
connection between policy gradient and dynamic programming in MMDPs and propose
the Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm to compute a Markov
policy that maximizes the discounted return averaged over the uncertain models.
CADP adjusts model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy
improvements to a local maximum. Second, We establish sufficient and necessary
conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and
prove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC
and EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration,
and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for
ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. Third, We propose model-free Q-learning algorithms for
computing policies with risk-averse objectives: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. The
challenge is that Q-learning ERM Bellman may not be a contraction. Instead, we
use the monotonicity of Q-learning ERM Bellman operators to derive a rigorous
proof that the ERM-TRC and the EVaR-TRC Q-learning algorithms converge to the
optimal risk-averse value functions. The proposed Q-learning algorithms compute
the optimal stationary policy for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

*Akhil S Anand,Shambhuraj Sawant,Jasper Hoffmann,Dirk Reinhardt,Sebastien Gros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Sim2Real框架，通过双层强化学习直接基于真实世界性能调整模拟器参数，以缩小Sim2Real性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Sim2Real方法通过优化模拟器精度和变异性作为真实世界性能的代理指标，但这些指标与策略在真实世界的性能不一定相关，导致模拟训练的策路在真实部署时性能显著下降。

Method: 采用双层强化学习框架：内层RL在模拟环境中训练策略，外层RL调整模拟模型和模拟内奖励参数，以最大化模拟策略在真实世界的性能。

Result: 在简单示例中推导并验证了开发双层RL算法所需的数学工具，这些算法能够缩小Sim2Real性能差距。

Conclusion: 该框架通过直接基于真实世界性能调整模拟器参数，为解决Sim2Real性能差距问题提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments
and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments
of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely
in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real
environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current
Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies
for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate
with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and
empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this
issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world
performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level
RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the
simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world
performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the
mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the
Sim2Real performance gap.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何提高黑盒大语言模型作为分类器的操作粒度，通过分析其低基数输出原因，并提出了有效方法在不损失性能的情况下显著增加可用操作点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒LLMs在需要特定指标约束的应用中表现不佳，因为其数值输出基数低，限制了操作点的控制能力，无法精细调整决策行为。

Method: 首先分析LLMs低基数输出的原因，发现其偏向生成四舍五入但信息丰富的语言化概率。然后实验标准提示工程、不确定性估计和置信度激发技术，最后提出有效方法来显著增加可用操作点的数量和多样性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效提高黑盒LLMs的操作粒度，在不牺牲性能或增加推理成本的情况下实现更精细的决策控制。

Abstract: Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible
alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled
data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision
making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints
on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with
black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output
cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points,
preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this
paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently
improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,
we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs
and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative
verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering,
uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that
they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing
performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient
approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available
operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating
points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark
methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究开发了物理信息神经网络(PINN)策略，将海冰物理知识整合到机器学习模型中，改进了北极海冰速度和浓度的预测，特别是在冰融化期和快速移动冰区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于北极海冰进入新阶段，冰层变薄且融化加速，完全数据驱动的机器学习模型在泛化性和物理一致性方面存在局限性，无法充分代表未来动态变化的海冰条件。

Method: 基于分层信息共享U-net架构，整合物理损失函数和激活函数，开发物理信息神经网络策略，将海冰物理知识融入机器学习模型。

Result: PINN模型在海冰速度和浓度的日预测中优于完全数据驱动模型，即使使用少量样本训练也能表现良好，特别是在冰融化和早期冻结季节以及快速移动冰区显著改善了海冰浓度预测。

Conclusion: 物理信息神经网络方法能够有效整合物理知识，提高海冰预测的准确性和物理一致性，为北极海冰动态变化的建模提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely
used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC).
However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and
physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and
quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase
with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML
model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the
dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we
develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical
knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical
Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics
loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV
and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the
daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of
samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and
early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于可微分图册的流形学习方法，支持直接在潜在数据流形上进行机器学习，相比传统降维方法具有更好的效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流形学习方法主要关注降维到欧几里得空间，当嵌入维度接近流形本征维度时会丢失关键特征。直接学习潜在流形作为可微分图册的方法相对较少被探索。

Method: 实现了一个通用数据结构来维护可微分图册，支持流形上的黎曼优化，并提出了从点云数据学习可微分图册的无监督启发式方法。

Result: 实验证明该方法在选定场景下具有效率和准确性优势，在Klein瓶上的监督分类任务和造血数据的RNA速度分析中展示了更好的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于图册的方法在流形学习领域具有有效性和潜力，为直接在数据流形上进行机器学习提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the manifold hypothesis, current manifold-learning
methods do not support machine learning directly on the latent $d$-dimensional
data manifold, as they primarily aim to perform dimensionality reduction into
$\mathbb{R}^D$, losing key manifold features when the embedding dimension $D$
approaches $d$.
  On the other hand, methods that directly learn the latent manifold as a
differentiable atlas have been relatively underexplored.
  In this paper, we aim to give a proof of concept of the effectiveness and
potential of atlas-based methods. To this end, we implement a generic data
structure to maintain a differentiable atlas that enables Riemannian
optimization over the manifold. We complement this with an unsupervised
heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data. We
experimentally demonstrate that this approach has advantages in terms of
efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. Moreover, in a supervised
classification task over the Klein bottle and in RNA velocity analysis of
hematopoietic data, we showcase the improved interpretability and robustness of
our approach.

*Jackson Harmon,Andreas Hochlehnert,Matthias Bethge,Ameya Prabhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个样本层面的框架来量化后训练过程中的知识遗忘和逆向迁移，发现不同后训练阶段对预训练知识的影响各不相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解规模化后训练对语言模型预训练知识的影响，因为知识遗忘问题不能简单地通过平均来抵消。

Method: 提出样本层面的度量方法，计算1->0转换（正确变错误）来量化遗忘，0->1转换（错误变正确）来量化逆向迁移，并针对选择题基准添加了机会调整变体。

Result: 大规模分析显示：领域持续预训练导致中度遗忘和低到中度逆向迁移；RL/SFT后训练在数学和逻辑上产生中到大的逆向迁移，总体遗忘较低；指令调优模型上的RL/SFT对数据规模敏感；模型融合不能可靠缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解后训练如何改变预训练知识提供了实用标准，有助于开发通用AI系统。

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in
language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly
understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.
president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence,
we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when
backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before
post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to
quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects
and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add
chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random
guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across
post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis
shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with
low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base
models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on
math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to
instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both
forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed
and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not
reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical
yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --
enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

*Adam Stecklov,Noah El Rimawi-Fine,Mathieu Blanchette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了在推理时保持线性插值的流匹配缩放方法，在图像和蛋白质生成任务中验证了推理计算增加能持续提升样本质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配在语言、视觉和科学领域受到关注，但其推理时缩放方法研究不足，现有方法会牺牲流匹配的高效采样特性

Method: 引入新颖的推理时缩放程序，在采样过程中保持线性插值，不采用非线性方差保持插值

Result: 在图像生成和无条件蛋白质生成任务中，样本质量随着推理计算增加而持续提升

Conclusion: 流匹配推理时缩放可应用于科学领域，且能保持高效采样特性

Abstract: Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample
quality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In
parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and
scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain
under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but
replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)
interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.
Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been
applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel
inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant
during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the
first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,
show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute
increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to
scientific domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Functional Distribution Networks (FDN)，一种输入条件化的网络权重分布方法，能够根据输入自适应调整预测混合的离散度，旨在解决概率回归模型在分布偏移下的过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代概率回归模型在分布偏移下往往保持过度自信，需要开发能够自适应调整预测不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用输入条件化的网络权重分布，通过beta-ELBO和蒙特卡洛采样进行训练，并提出了评估协议来区分插值和外推。

Result: 在标准回归任务上，与贝叶斯、集成、dropout和超网络基线相比，在匹配参数和更新预算下评估了准确性、校准和偏移感知能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和协议旨在使具有OOD感知和良好校准的神经回归变得实用和模块化。

Abstract: Modern probabilistic regressors often remain overconfident under distribution
shift. We present Functional Distribution Networks (FDN), an input-conditioned
distribution over network weights that induces predictive mixtures whose
dispersion adapts to the input. FDN is trained with a beta-ELBO and Monte Carlo
sampling. We further propose an evaluation protocol that cleanly separates
interpolation from extrapolation and stresses OOD sanity checks (e.g., that
predictive likelihood degrades under shift while in-distribution accuracy and
calibration are maintained). On standard regression tasks, we benchmark against
strong Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched
parameter and update budgets, and assess accuracy, calibration, and
shift-awareness with standard diagnostics. Together, the framework and protocol
aim to make OOD-aware, well-calibrated neural regression practical and modular.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GUM的无偏低秩优化方法，通过层间采样技术消除低秩投影的偏差，在保持内存效率的同时实现与全参数训练相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有梯度低秩投影方法（如GaLore）虽然内存效率高，但缺乏收敛保证，且因投影偏差导致性能与全参数训练存在差距。

Method: 基于GaLore机制和Muon算法，采用层间采样技术构建无偏低秩优化方法GUM，理论证明其收敛性与Muon算法匹配。

Result: 在LLM微调和预训练实验中，GUM相比GaLore有显著提升，甚至优于全参数训练，知识在层内分布更均匀，参数空间利用更高效。

Conclusion: GUM方法成功解决了低秩投影的偏差问题，在保持内存效率的同时实现了更好的训练性能，为大规模语言模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large
language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank
projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a
representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is
their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches
introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,
which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.
Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling
technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an
instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank
optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named
GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the
convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory
efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and
pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even
better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows
that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution
of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model
parameter space and better memorization.

TL;DR: VisuoAlign是一个通过提示引导树搜索进行多模态安全对齐的框架，旨在解决大型视觉语言模型在安全对齐方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法对多模态越狱攻击脆弱，因为视觉输入引入了新的攻击面，推理链缺乏安全监督，且模态融合会降低对齐效果。

Method: 通过视觉-文本交互提示将安全约束嵌入推理过程，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建多样化的安全关键提示轨迹，并引入基于提示的缩放实现实时风险检测和合规响应。

Result: 实验表明VisuoAlign能主动暴露风险，实现全面的数据集生成，并显著提高LVLMs对复杂跨模态威胁的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VisuoAlign框架有效解决了多模态安全对齐的关键挑战，提升了大型视觉语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a
critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks,
as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety
supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome
these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety
alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains
into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs
Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse
safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to
ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive
dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against
complex cross-modal threats.

TL;DR: 提出了结构化认知循环（SCL）作为可执行的认知框架，将哲学洞见转化为可计算结构，重新定义智能为通过意向性理解重建自身认知状态的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型缺乏真正的认知理解，暴露了认知架构的缺失。传统AI研究关注'什么是智能'的本体论问题，而SCL关注'在什么条件下认知会涌现'的认识论问题

Method: 基于过程哲学、具身认知和扩展心智理论，将智能定义为执行过程——判断、记忆、控制、行动和调节的连续循环。通过功能分离的认知架构实现'可执行的认识论'

Result: 功能分离的认知架构比单一提示系统产生更连贯和可解释的行为。智能不是表征准确性，而是通过意向性理解重建自身认知状态的能力

Conclusion: SCL框架对心智哲学、认识论和AI产生影响，将知识重新定义为在现象学连贯循环中的持续重建，而非真理占有。真正的进步需要实现认知原则的结构化架构，而非更大的模型

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic
understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This
paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable
epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI
research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what
conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of
mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and
implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and
extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a
performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,
and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes
philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling
"executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it
shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more
coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,
supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not
representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic
state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of
mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to
be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure
rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not
as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a
phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive
phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real
progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive
principles structurally.

Conclusion: 城市虚拟世界有潜力成为监管学习的重要实验空间，但需要负责任的发展方法，充分考虑伦理、经济、生态和社会维度，并整合到更广泛的实验生态系统。

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering
immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and
technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the
potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning,
grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including
policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers
and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies
key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity
modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation,
ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In
addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning
transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could
be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas.
The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and
emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It
prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and
social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential
preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader
ecosystems of experimentation spaces, including test beds, living labs and

Motivation: 现有AI代理记忆系统缺乏对多样化任务的适应性，且忽视了记忆的建构性和任务导向作用。

Method: 提出PISA系统，包含三模态适应机制（图式更新、图式演化和图式创建）和结合符号推理与神经检索的混合记忆访问架构。

Result: 在LOCOMO基准和新提出的AggQA基准上，PISA在数据分析和长期知识保留方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PISA通过将记忆视为建构性和适应性过程，为AI代理提供了更有效的记忆系统解决方案。

Abstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks
adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented
role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development,
we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that
addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive
process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a
trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and
schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible
memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design
a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic
reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO
benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks,
confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing
adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使为大型语言模型提供环境接口来跟踪状态空间，也无法避免其在解决复杂谜题时出现的性能崩溃现象，模型会表现出模式崩溃行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型推理模型在解决超越特定困惑度阈值的谜题时出现性能崩溃的原因，特别是验证是否由于模型需要自行跟踪状态空间这一要求混淆了对真实推理能力的评估。

Method: 为大型语言模型提供汉诺塔问题的环境接口，允许其通过工具调用进行移动、提供书面理由、观察结果状态空间，并重新提示自己进行下一步移动。

Result: 环境接口的访问并不能延迟或消除性能崩溃。LLM参数化策略分析显示模型与最优策略和均匀随机策略的偏离度增加，表明模型在每个复杂度级别都表现出模式崩溃。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中会出现模式崩溃现象，性能取决于模式是否反映问题的正确解决方案，类似现象可能也存在于大型推理模型中。

Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in
performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In
subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the
task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the
requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide
a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi
problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written
justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the
next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or
eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis
reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random
policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level
of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects
the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might
take place in LRMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知负荷理论启发，为深度模型开发可解释的中层框架来量化内部资源分配，帮助理解模型的推理动态

Method: 将CLTs定义为三分量随机过程(IL_t, EL_t, GL_t)，分别对应内在、外在和关联负荷，通过注意力熵、KV缓存未命中率、表示分散度和解码稳定性等可测量代理来实例化，提出符号化公式和可视化方法

Result: 在推理和规划基准测试中，CLTs能够预测错误发生、揭示认知策略，负荷引导干预在保持准确性的同时将推理效率提高15-30%

Conclusion: CLTs为深度模型提供了有效的可解释性分析框架，能够量化内部认知负荷并指导模型优化

Abstract: We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level
interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory
in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions
that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs
as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t,
\mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and
\emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies
such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and
decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization
methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of
reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that
CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided
interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining
accuracy.

*Rafael Cabral,Tuan Manh Do,Xuejun Yu,Wai Ming Tai,Zijin Feng,Xin Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProofFlow是一个新的证明自动形式化流水线，通过构建逻辑依赖图和基于引理的方法来保持原始证明的结构保真度，在184个本科级问题基准上取得了0.545的ProofScore，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前证明自动形式化方法虽然能生成可执行代码，但经常无法保持原始人工证明的语义含义和逻辑结构，这限制了大型语言模型在严格数学工作流程中的集成。

Method: ProofFlow首先构建有向无环图来映射证明步骤间的逻辑依赖关系，然后采用基于引理的方法系统地将每个步骤形式化为中间引理，从而保持原始论证的逻辑结构。

Result: 在184个本科级问题的新基准上，ProofFlow实现了0.545的ProofScore，大幅超过了全证明形式化(0.123)和逐步证明形式化(0.072)等基线方法。

Conclusion: ProofFlow通过重视结构保真度，为证明自动形式化设立了新的最先进水平，其流水线、基准和评分指标已开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems
and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating
large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches
focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the
semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument.
To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats
structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof
steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically
formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure
of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark
of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step
solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new
composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and
structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new
state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545,
substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which
processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which
handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are
open-sourced to encourage further progress at

Abstract: An essential component for evaluating and comparing physical and cognitive
capabilities between populations is the testing of various factors related to
human performance. As a core part of sports science research, testing motor
performance enables the analysis of the physical health of different
demographic groups and makes them comparable.
  The Motor Research (MO|RE) data repository, developed at the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, is an infrastructure for publishing and archiving
research data in sports science, particularly in the field of motor performance
research. In this paper, we present our vision for creating a knowledge graph
from MO|RE data. With an ontology rooted in the Basic Formal Ontology, our
approach centers on formally representing the interrelation of plan
specifications, specific processes, and related measurements. Our goal is to
transform how motor performance data are modeled and shared across studies,
making it standardized and machine-understandable. The idea presented here is
developed within the Leibniz Science Campus ``Digital Transformation of
Research'' (DiTraRe).

*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Enrique Herrera-Viedma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于随机置换集(RPS)的冲突度量方法，从随机有限集(RFS)和D-S理论(DST)两个角度分析RPS中的冲突，利用秩偏重叠(RBO)概念定义置换间的不一致性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机置换集作为处理包含顺序信息的不确定性的新形式，需要有效度量两个置换质量函数表示的证据之间的冲突，以支持顺序结构不确定信息融合。

Method: 从置换观察出发，基于秩偏重叠(RBO)度量定义置换间的不一致性度量，提出非重叠基础的RPS冲突度量方法，将RPS理论视为D-S理论的扩展。

Result: 数值示例验证了所提冲突度量的行为和特性，该方法具有自然的顶部加权特性，能从DST视角有效度量RPS间的冲突。

Conclusion: 所提方法不仅具有顶部加权特性，能有效度量RPS冲突，还为决策者提供了权重、参数和截断深度的灵活选择。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with
uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two
pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent
research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper,
a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different
perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency
measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure
and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This
paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information
newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by
top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict
measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property
and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but
also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters,
and truncated depths.

TL;DR: PAINT是一种用于建模动态系统的并行时间神经孪生方法，通过生成神经网络并行建模状态分布，能够在测试时从测量数据预测系统状态，保持轨迹跟踪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经代理在模拟动态系统时缺乏保持轨迹跟踪的能力，无法创建能够准确反映真实系统状态的数字孪生体。

Method: PAINT训练生成神经网络并行建模时间上的状态分布，在测试时通过滑动窗口方式从测量数据预测状态。

Result: 在二维湍流流体动力学问题上的实验表明，PAINT能够保持轨迹跟踪，从稀疏测量数据中高保真地预测系统状态。

Conclusion: PAINT为开发能够保持轨迹跟踪的神经孪生体提供了潜力，能够实现更准确的状态估计和决策制定。

Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems,
while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a
progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real
systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state,
thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of
neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to
the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins
(PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical
systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model
the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are
predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical
analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models
generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging
two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that
PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements
with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing
neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation
and decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出ISGFAN框架，通过信息分离和全局-局部对抗学习解决噪声环境下跨域故障诊断问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移故障诊断方法通常假设数据干净或域相似性足够，但在工业环境中严重噪声干扰和域偏移共存，限制了这些方法的有效性。

Method: 基于信息分离架构，结合对抗学习和改进的正交损失来解耦域不变故障表示，隔离噪声干扰和域特定特征。采用全局-局部域对抗方案约束模型的条什分布和边缘分布。

Result: 在三个公共基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他现有先进方法。

Conclusion: ISGFAN框架在噪声环境下的跨域故障诊断中表现出优越性，证实了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data
or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial
environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To
address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal
adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault
diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation
architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal
loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise
interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen
transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme
that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model.
Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates
category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios,
while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall
distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing
approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework. Data and code
are available at https://github.com/JYREN-Source/ISGFAN

*Ioan Hedea*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合离线约束编程优化和在线时间网络执行的混合调度方法，能够在最坏情况不确定性下保持调度可行性，完全消除截止时间违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造系统需要在应对随机任务持续时间的同时满足严格的交付截止时间，传统确定性调度在现实偏离名义计划时会失效，导致昂贵的紧急维修。

Method: 首先构建柔性作业车间约束编程模型并插入最优缓冲Δ*，然后将计划转换为简单不确定时间网络并验证动态可控性，确保实时调度器能够重新安排活动时间而不违反约束。

Result: 在Kacem 1-4基准测试套件上的蒙特卡洛模拟显示，该方法完全消除了最先进元启发式调度中观察到的截止时间违规，同时仅增加3-5%的制造周期开销。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了时间网络推理如何弥合主动缓冲和动态鲁棒性之间的差距，使工业更接近真正的数字化、自校正工厂。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping
with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability,
and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when
reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs.
This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with
online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible
under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible
job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to
obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a
Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic
controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime
activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or
deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4
benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline
violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding
only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP
solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The
work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between
proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to
truly digital, self-correcting factories.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了LLM生成的临床思维链的可靠性，发现选择性少样本策略显著优于零样本和随机少样本策略，提出了基于"黄金标准深度"和"代表性多样性"的双原则框架来生成可信的临床数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据稀缺，创建高质量的临床思维链对于可解释医疗AI至关重要，但LLM生成的临床数据可靠性尚未得到验证。

Method: 在辅助生殖技术领域进行盲法比较研究，由资深临床医生评估三种策略生成的思维链：零样本、随机少样本和选择性少样本，并与GPT-4o的评估结果进行比较。

Result: 选择性少样本策略在所有人类评估指标上显著优于其他策略，而随机少样本策略相比零样本基线无显著改进。AI评估器未能识别这些关键性能差异。

Conclusion: 合成思维链的临床可靠性取决于策略性提示词优化，而非仅仅提供示例。提出了"双原则"框架作为规模化生成可信数据的基础方法，确认了人类专业知识在评估高风险临床AI中的不可或缺作用。

Abstract: Creating high-quality clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) is crucial for
explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) while constrained by data
scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data,
their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the
reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to
enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three
distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and
Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings
were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o).
The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies
across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot
strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline,
demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The
success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles:
"Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity"
(generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical
performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated
by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a
"Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate
trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data
bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating
high-stakes clinical AI.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩展认知理论的形式化模型，将企业知识重新定义为可测量的动态能力，通过信息访问程序的效率和输出可靠性来量化企业知识状态，为算法时代的企业责任认定提供可审计的度量标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统企业责任认定基于人类代理人的主观意图，但随着生成式AI在企业决策中的广泛应用，这种假设面临挑战。需要新的理论框架来应对AI中介的企业决策环境。

Method: 基于扩展认知理论，开发了一个形式化模型来捕捉部署复杂AI或信息系统企业的认知状态。引入连续组织知识度量S_S(φ)，整合管道的计算成本和统计验证的错误率，推导出阈值知识谓词K_S和企业范围认知能力指数K_{S,t}。

Result: 建立了定量度量与法律标准（实际知识、推定知识、故意无视和鲁莽）之间的操作映射，为创建可测量和可司法化的审计工件提供了途径。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一条使企业思维在算法时代变得可处理和可问责的路径，通过可量化的认知能力指标来支持企业责任的认定。

Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea},
traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under
challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making.
Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response
corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the
efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability
of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of
corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a
continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a
pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We
derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and
a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall
capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal
standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and
recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and
justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and
accountable in the algorithmic age.

Conclusion: TEAM-PHI为PHI去识别提供了实用、安全、经济高效的自动评估和最佳模型选择方案

Abstract: Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling
the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI
de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert
annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection
framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure
de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy
reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each
independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting
structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based
majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a
single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical
note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate
rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting
reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with
ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's
automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining
independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a
practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and
best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels
are limited.

Result: 建立了应对AI信息集中化风险的理论基础，为保护数字存在有限的群体和防止集体记忆扭曲提供了概念性解决方案。

Conclusion: "被记住权"是应对AI时代信息权力集中的重要权利概念，需要在技术发展中平衡信息权威性与多样性，保护弱势群体的数字存在。

Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun
to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines
display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO),
advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response
that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of
bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple
perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare
alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors
whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a
result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately
suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this
creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital
presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping
collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of
the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of
AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while
ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust
evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated
ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework
that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the
empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and
contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different
dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce
ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas
and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows
that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in
the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines.
Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline
o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI,
in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our
large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms
deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We
openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use
and build on.

Method: 通过跨多个模型和基准的综合研究，分析了推理分心的脆弱性，并提出了结合监督微调和强化学习的训练防御方法，使用合成的对抗数据进行训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable
performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically
analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are
diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks
maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across
diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are
highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to
60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this
weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden
adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final
output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on
synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on
challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as
a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step
toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM
capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web
interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential
errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning
performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,
we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency
bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency
into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to
demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web
environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a
web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching
framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment
overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our
approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching
strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without
degrading agentic system performance.

*Changhao Wang,Yanfang Liu,Xinxin Fan,Anzhi Zhou,Lao Tian,Yunfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DTKG框架，通过双轨知识图谱验证和推理来解决多跳问答任务中的并行事实验证和链式推理问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多跳推理方法存在局限性：基于LLM响应的事实验证擅长并行验证但链式推理表现差，基于KG路径的链构建擅长链式推理但处理并行验证时存在冗余路径检索问题

Method: 受认知科学双过程理论启发，提出DTKG双轨KG验证和推理框架，包含分类阶段和分支处理阶段

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明

Conclusion: DTKG框架能够有效解决多跳问答任务中的效率和准确性问题

Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs).
The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of
entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency
and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into
two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,
i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent
sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding
sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as
essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning
approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact
verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former
excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning
tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning
but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel
fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and
accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by
the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two
main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

*Crystal Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedRule-KG是一个紧凑的知识图谱和符号验证器系统，用于在推理任务中强制执行数学可解释规则，显著提高大型语言模型的推理准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生流畅的推理步骤，但违反简单的数学或逻辑约束，需要一种方法来确保推理的数学可解释性和一致性。

Method: 引入MedRule-KG，包括一个紧凑的类型化知识图谱和符号验证器，知识图谱编码实体、关系和三个领域启发规则，验证器检查预测并应用最小修正以保证一致性。

Result: 在90个FDA衍生基准测试中，基于MedRule-KG的推理将精确匹配从0.767提高到0.900，添加验证器后达到1.000精确匹配，完全消除了规则违反。

Conclusion: MedRule-KG为安全的数学推理提供了一个通用框架，通过知识图谱和符号验证确保推理的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while
violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG,
a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to
enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG
encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the
verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee
consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG
improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields
1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how
MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss
ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

*Tong Zhang,Ru Zhang,Jianyi Liu,Zhen Yang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了SELECT框架，通过动态锚点选择解决文本到图像扩散模型中概念擦除的锚点固定问题，避免概念重现和侵蚀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法依赖固定锚点策略，导致概念重现和侵蚀等关键问题，需要更灵活的锚点选择机制。

Method: 通过因果追踪分析擦除对锚点选择的敏感性，定义兄弟排他概念作为更优锚点类别，提出两阶段评估机制自动发现最优锚点。

Result: SELECT作为通用锚点解决方案，能高效适配多种擦除框架，在关键性能指标上持续优于现有基线，单个概念锚点挖掘仅需4秒。

Conclusion: 动态锚点选择框架SELECT有效解决了固定锚点的局限性，实现了更精确的概念擦除同时保护相关概念。

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly
rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as
concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to
reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define
Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for
Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to
overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel
two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for
precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related
concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor
solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also
consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics,
averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

*Ali Shirali*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 用户与算法的交互中，存在理性系统2和冲动系统1的决策冲突。通过Stackelberg博弈模型分析，发现用户需要足够长的优化视野才能有效引导算法，而临界视野可以通过额外信号显著缩短。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究用户在算法交互中的不一致偏好问题，探索用户如何在与算法的多步交互中有效引导算法符合其真实兴趣。

Method: 将用户决策过程建模为理性系统2（决定是否参与）和冲动系统1（决定参与时长），构建多领导者单跟随者的扩展Stackelberg博弈模型，分析用户承诺参与策略下算法的最优响应。

Result: 存在临界视野：足够远见的用户可实现算法对齐，否则会被算法目标同化。额外的小成本信号（如额外点击）可显著降低临界视野要求。

Conclusion: 框架解释了具有不一致偏好的用户如何在Stackelberg均衡中实现与参与驱动算法的对齐，揭示了实现对齐的挑战和潜在解决方案。

Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact,
learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an
algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can
guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively
engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent
preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little
long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.
Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for
such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split
between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive
system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a
multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,
specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the
algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of
alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively
steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are
sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are
instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be
long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal
(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework
explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven
algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both
the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

### [439] [Before you <think>, monitor: Implementing Flavell's metacognitive framework in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16374)
*Nick Oh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合监控-生成-验证的三阶段迭代系统，在GSM8K数学推理任务上取得了75.42%的准确率，优于现有方法且需要更少的尝试次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理方法存在两种孤立范式：监控-生成方法擅长策略规划但缺乏验证机制，生成-验证方法能迭代优化但缺乏任务评估。这种分离导致策略失败无反馈、优化无策略基础的低效问题。

Method: 基于Flavell的认知监控模型，实现了一个三阶段迭代系统，将监控、生成和验证整合到一个统一框架中。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上达到75.42%准确率，优于SELF-REFINE(68.44%)和Self-Verification(67.07%)，仅需1.3次尝试（对比2.0次），推理成本增加27-37%。

Conclusion: 前期监控能产生更高质量的初始解决方案，减少后续优化需求，但需要在算术推理之外的任务上进一步验证其泛化能力。

Abstract: Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning follows two isolated paradigms:
Monitor-Generate methods like Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023) and
SELF-DISCOVER (Zhou et al., 2024) excel at strategic planning but lack
mechanisms to verify whether selected strategies succeed; while Generate-Verify
approaches like Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) and SELF-REFINE (Madaan
et al., 2023) iteratively refine outputs but commence generation blindly
without task assessment. This separation creates inefficiencies -- strategies
fail without feedback, and refinement occurs without strategic grounding. We
address this gap by implementing Flavell's cognitive monitoring model (1979)
from the broader Monitor-Generate-Verify framework (Oh and Gobet, 2025),
operationalising it as a three-phase iterative system. On GSM8K, preliminary
results show 75.42% accuracy versus 68.44% for SELF-REFINE and 67.07% for
Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts (1.3 vs 2.0) at 27-37%
increased inference cost. These initial findings suggest upfront monitoring
produces higher-quality initial solutions that reduce refinement needs, though
evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is needed to establish generalisability.

TL;DR: 提出HSCM框架，模仿人类视觉系统的层次处理和多级学习，通过解耦和重加权图像属性来增强跨域泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统领域泛化模型的局限性，传统方法依赖统计数据捕捉数据标签依赖关系，而HSCM专注于建模细粒度因果机制

Method: 基于人类智能的层次结构因果模型，解耦和重加权关键图像属性（颜色、纹理、形状），模仿人类视觉系统的处理方式

Result: 在理论和实证评估中，HSCM优于现有领域泛化模型，提供更稳健的性能和可解释性

Conclusion: HSCM为捕捉因果关系和提升模型鲁棒性提供了更原则性的方法，在动态复杂环境中实现更有效的迁移学习

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a
novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the
limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches
that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn
distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical
processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on
modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key
image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances
generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and
interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human
intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in
dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain
generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal
relationships and improving model robustness. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RGMem框架，通过多尺度记忆演化解决LLM对话系统中长期用户建模的挑战，实现行为一致性和个性化交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案如RAG和显式记忆系统主要关注事实级存储和检索，缺乏从多轮对话中提取潜在偏好和深层特征的能力，限制了有效的长期用户建模。

Method: 受物理学重整化群思想启发，RGMem框架通过分层粗粒化和重标度操作，在多个尺度上组织对话历史，从片段中提取语义和用户洞察，逐步形成动态演化的用户画像。

Result: 该框架能够从噪声和微观层面的交互中实现高层次、准确的用户画像，解决了有限上下文窗口和静态参数记忆的限制。

Conclusion: RGMem通过将记忆演化建模为信息压缩和涌现的多尺度过程，实现了语言代理在LLM时代的长期记忆和行为一致性。

Abstract: Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user
experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems,
however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it
difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral
consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily
focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill
latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits
the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized
interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To
realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in
LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the
ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework
enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts
semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical
coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a
dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in
modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression
and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles
from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.

TL;DR: ReviewSense是一个基于大语言模型的决策支持框架，可将客户评论转化为可操作的业务建议，超越传统偏好预测系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统擅长预测用户偏好，但缺乏将客户评论转化为面向业务的规范性建议的能力，而客户反馈对战略增长至关重要。

Method: 集成聚类、LLM适配和专家驱动评估的统一业务管道，识别关键趋势、重复问题和具体关注点。

Result: 初步人工评估显示模型建议与业务目标高度一致，具有推动数据驱动决策的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI驱动的情感分析提供了新视角，在优化业务策略和最大化客户反馈影响方面具有价值。

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the
ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential.
While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far
less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive,
business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel
prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language
models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business
recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific
concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond
preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for
sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies
in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a
unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate
strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives,
highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This
framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis,
demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the
impact of customer feedback.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NP-ENGINE框架，首个专门用于训练和评估LLMs在NP难问题上的综合系统，包含10个任务、可控实例生成器、验证器和启发式求解器。训练出的QWEN2.5-7B-NP模型在NP-BENCH基准上超越GPT-4o，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在数学、编程等推理任务上表现出色，但在NP难优化问题上的能力尚未充分探索，需要专门框架来训练和评估这类复杂推理能力。

Method: 开发NP-ENGINE框架，包含10个NP难任务，采用生成器-验证器-启发式求解器管道，支持可扩展的RLVR训练。使用零RLVR和课程学习训练QWEN2.5-7B-NP模型。

Result: QWEN2.5-7B-NP在NP-BENCH基准上显著超越GPT-4o，达到同规模模型的SOTA性能。在跨领域推理任务（逻辑、谜题、数学、知识）和非推理任务（指令跟随）上都展现出强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: 任务丰富的RLVR训练是提升LLM推理能力的有前景方向，揭示了RLVR的扩展规律，任务多样性增加有助于提升跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with
models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as
mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex
optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To
bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for
training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks
across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator,
(ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides
approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This
generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR
training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a
benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs'
ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on
feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present
QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and
achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we
demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge),
as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a
scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These
findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for
advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws
of RLVR.

TL;DR: Doug是一个类型化计算机语言，所有类型化程序都能被证明在多项式时间内停止，编码在向量符号架构中。它基于轻量线性函数式编程语言，类型使用全息声明性内存编码，项使用Lisp VSA变体编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望描述一种遵循人类技能获取速度的学习方式，比现有方法更高效，更接近模拟人脑中的心理表征及其获取过程。

Method: 将类型化语言Doug编码到向量符号架构中，类型使用基于全息声明性内存的槽值编码方案，项使用Lisp VSA变体编码。

Result: Doug允许神经网络嵌入空间中的某些点被解释为类型，附近点的类型在结构和内容上都相似，因此类型可由神经网络学习。

Conclusion: 该方法使我们更接近模拟人脑中实际存在的心理表征及其获取过程，为技能获取提供更高效的编程合成方法。

Abstract: We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may
be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture
(VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming
language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are
encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative
memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the
Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the
embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types
of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are
therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,
1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or
program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may
therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a
form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill
acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000),
exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020;
Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling
human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and
those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.

Conclusion: 强化学习对齐是实现公平可信城市智能的有前景途径，Urban-R1框架为城市基础模型的公平性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence
(UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex
urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit
persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited
generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement
learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of
UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize
reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a
proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive
experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively
mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both
SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement
learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy
urban intelligence.

Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language
specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated
reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad
knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates
for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To
address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned
interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It
contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable
benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an
extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across
multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for
supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM
agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On
eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities
for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation. The project

*Ayush Chopra,Aman Sharma,Feroz Ahmad,Luca Muscariello,Vijoy Pandey,Ramesh Raskar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Ripple Effect Protocol (REP)，一种协调协议，让智能体不仅分享决策，还分享轻量级的敏感性信号，从而在群体中实现更快更稳定的协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的A2A和ACP等通信协议强调通信而非协调，随着智能体群体规模扩大，这会导致脆弱的集体行为，即使个体智能体很聪明，群体结果也很差。

Method: 引入REP协议，智能体分享决策和敏感性信号（表达关键环境变量变化时选择如何改变），这些敏感性在局部网络中传播。协议规范分离了必需的消息模式和可选的聚合规则。

Result: 在三个领域的基准测试中：供应链级联、稀疏网络中的偏好聚合、可持续资源分配，REP相比A2A将协调准确性和效率提高了41%到100%，并能灵活处理来自LLM的多模态敏感性信号。

Conclusion: 通过将协调作为协议级能力，REP为新兴的智能体互联网提供了可扩展的基础设施。

Abstract: Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP,
yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent
populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where
individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the
Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not
only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing
how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These
sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster
and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's
protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional
aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and
network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades
(Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling),
and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves
coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly
handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a
protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the
emerging Internet of Agents

Result: 在STaRK基准测试中，GraphFlow在命中率和召回率上平均优于强基线方法（包括GPT-4o）10%，并在未见过的知识图谱上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GraphFlow能够有效从文本丰富的知识图谱中检索准确多样的知识，满足现实世界复杂查询的需求，展现出良好的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances
large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external
knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate
and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries.
Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of
KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely
on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on
KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that
efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world
queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching
objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow
estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate
retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to
retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows
GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and
relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes
real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow
outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit
rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Motivation: 现有不确定知识图谱补全方法忽略了置信度的极端不平衡分布，导致学习到的嵌入不足以进行高质量补全。

Method: 提出ssCDL方法，将置信度转化为分布引入更多监督信息，通过元学习生成伪标签来扩充训练数据并重新平衡置信度分布。

Result: 在两个UKG数据集上的实验表明，ssCDL在不同评估指标上均优于现有最优基线方法。

Conclusion: ssCDL通过处理置信度不平衡问题，有效提升了不确定知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence
score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since
real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG)
completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and
confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this
problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple
confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to
high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue,
we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL)
method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a
confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different
confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively
learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing
triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen
triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning
to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple
confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: MERCI是一种增强LLM推理能力的强化学习算法，通过基于计数的内在奖励来激励探索，避免重复推理模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法依赖稀疏结果奖励和有限探索，导致LLM陷入重复和次优的推理模式，需要设计更好的探索机制。

Method: 使用轻量级Coin Flipping Network估计推理轨迹的伪计数和认知不确定性，将其转换为内在奖励，并与任务奖励结合优化策略。

Result: 在复杂推理基准测试中，MERCI鼓励更丰富多样的思维链，显著优于强基线，帮助策略逃离局部最优找到更好解决方案。

Conclusion: 针对性的内在动机可以使探索在语言模型推理中更加可靠有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the
multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited
exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design
exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in
LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that
augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on
the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin
Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic
uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic
reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task
rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of
thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps
the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates
that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for
language model reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a
transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm
shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of
end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we
explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major
neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer
interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling,
clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific
applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are
demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including
multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and
the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover,
the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,
as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to
develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review
highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation
considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks,
effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines
for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience
datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse
research applications is provided.

Motivation: 解决复杂车辆路径问题需要大量专家努力进行意图解释和算法设计，现有LLM方法仍依赖外部干预，导致自主性受限、执行错误和解决方案可行性低。

Method: AFL框架将整体流程分解为三个可管理的子任务，并采用四个专门代理，通过协调交互确保跨功能一致性和逻辑合理性，直接从原始输入提取知识并生成自包含代码。

Result: 在60个复杂VRP问题上的广泛实验验证了框架的有效性和通用性，与精心设计的算法性能相当，在代码可靠性和解决方案可行性方面显著优于现有LLM基线，在评估基准上接近100%的成功率。

Conclusion: AFL框架实现了从问题实例到解决方案的完全自动化，显著提高了LLM在解决复杂车辆路径问题中的可靠性和可行性。

Abstract: Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge,
demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm
design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward
automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which
restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution
feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with
LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full
automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge
from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted
modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the
overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized
agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and
logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from
standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and
generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against
meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms
existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility,
achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial
intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but
act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building
agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory
are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,
where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We
first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling
this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to
outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task
across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey
systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --
has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.
Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent
applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon
reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by
discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like
Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the
system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments
outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated
learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing
systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence
through experience.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access
and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs
remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability
to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external
evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,
lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in
agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,
and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within
this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for
adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first
comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the
emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for
(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)
Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative
methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges
and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic
search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the
integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at

Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven
engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with
optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two
central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration
requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and
reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a
workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on
compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency
approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every
simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design
to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we
proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using
surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The
methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect
and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency
of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy
and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the
approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis
of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation.
Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale
exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors,
identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates
require more data or alternative architectures.

Motivation: 多模态知识图谱存在不完整性问题，而现有方法在处理多模态信息时面临语义噪声、模态冲突和高计算成本的挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: 在FB15k-237-IMG和WN18-IMG基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时显著提高计算效率。

Conclusion: ELMM为多模态知识图谱补全建立了新的范式，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by
incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more
expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from
incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks.
Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving
increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting
remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large
number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality
conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token
inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal
Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token
Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively
compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively
reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality
conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove
redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the
inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the
performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark
FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art
performance while substantially improving computational efficiency,
establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

Conclusion: ELLSA朝着更自然和通用的交互智能迈出了一步，有助于实现更广泛的人工通用智能。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while
watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and
interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models
simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),
which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that
simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action
within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of
reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel
SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each
modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention
backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal
perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components
while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality
interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA
matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced
multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,
defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual
question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a
step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to
the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and
model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but
remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and
lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To
address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that
enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For
scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a
lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual
descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant
context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,
GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable
modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual
modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit
topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large
graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and
consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,
achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art
baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

Result: 在教育、企业知识系统和技术文档等案例研究中，CDC实现了上下文感知推理、跨领域类比和个性化知识建模。

Conclusion: CDC框架克服了传统基于本体的知识表示限制，提供了传统框架无法实现的能力。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that
organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in
treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level
components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized
Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains
to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple
structure - <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'> - where domain specifications
serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a
cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how
humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than
twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and
temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case
studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation
demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and
personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional
ontology-based frameworks.

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research
reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练视觉语言模型智能体的关键挑战在于从文本状态到复杂视觉观察的转变，这引入了部分可观测性并需要强大的世界建模能力。

Method: 将智能体推理过程架构化为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程，分解为状态估计和转移建模，设计世界建模奖励和双层广义优势估计方法。

Result: 3B参数模型在五个智能体基准测试中获得0.82分，相比未训练模型(0.21)提升3倍，优于GPT-5(0.75)、Gemini 2.5 Pro(0.67)和Claude 4.5(0.62)。

Conclusion: 视觉状态推理能有效提升VLM智能体性能，最优表示形式是任务依赖的，自然语言擅长语义关系，结构化格式对精确操作至关重要。

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to
Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex
visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and
demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world
models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we
architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via
reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into
State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what
comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning
strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs
reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language
excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured
formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on
these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,
turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level
General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.
Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a
score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$
improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary
reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5
(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable
system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual
environments. Code and data are publicly available at

*Mark Towers,Yali Du,Christopher Freeman,Timothy J. Norman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的评估方法，用于测试用户能否从强化学习算法的决策解释中识别出代理的目标。在Ms. Pacman环境中测试了四种可解释强化学习算法，发现只有一种算法的准确率超过随机水平，且用户普遍高估了自己的选择准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可解释强化学习算法的核心应用是调试，但目前缺乏对其相对性能的比较评估。

Method: 使用Atari的Ms. Pacman环境和四种可解释强化学习算法，通过用户测试来评估他们是否能从算法解释中识别代理的目标。

Result: 只有一种算法的准确率超过随机水平；用户普遍对自己的选择过度自信；用户自报的识别和理解难易程度与准确率没有相关性。

Conclusion: 当前的可解释强化学习算法在帮助用户识别代理目标方面效果有限，且用户的自我评估与实际表现存在差异。

Abstract: Debugging is a core application of explainable reinforcement learning (XRL)
algorithms; however, limited comparative evaluations have been conducted to
understand their relative performance. We propose a novel evaluation
methodology to test whether users can identify an agent's goal from an
explanation of its decision-making. Utilising the Atari's Ms. Pacman
environment and four XRL algorithms, we find that only one achieved greater
than random accuracy for the tested goals and that users were generally
overconfident in their selections. Further, we find that users' self-reported
ease of identification and understanding for every explanation did not
correlate with their accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的多智能体框架，用于自动化GPU内核优化，通过系统探索设计空间和迭代优化，显著提升内核性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内核优化对AI发展至关重要，但现有方法难以处理内存层次、线程调度和硬件特性之间的复杂交互。传统LLM方法作为单次生成器或简单优化工具效果有限。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，包含基于经验的指令、动态上下文管理和策略搜索，模拟专家工程师的工作流程，让LLM能够推理硬件权衡、整合性能分析反馈并迭代优化内核。

Result: 在KernelBench基准测试中，系统在基线方法失败的情况下仍能生成正确解决方案，并实现高达16倍运行时的性能提升。

Conclusion: 智能体LLM框架在实现完全自动化、可扩展的GPU内核优化方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet
optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex
interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and
hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing
approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement
tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel
optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel
optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent
collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic
search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs
to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine
kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for
LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often
fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These
results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully
automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

TL;DR: ToolCritic是一个诊断框架，用于评估和改进LLM在多轮工具增强对话中的行为，通过检测8种特定错误类型并提供针对性反馈，使LLM能够修正响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具增强的大型语言模型在现实应用中越来越普遍，但工具使用错误仍然影响其可靠性，需要解决这一问题以提高LLM与外部工具集成的鲁棒性。

Method: 系统定义了8种工具调用错误类型，构建合成数据集训练ToolCritic，该框架检测错误并提供反馈，让具有强推理能力的主LLM基于反馈修正响应。

Result: 在Schema-Guided Dialogue数据集上的实验表明，ToolCritic比基线方法（包括零样本提示和自校正技术）将工具调用准确率提高了高达13%。

Conclusion: ToolCritic是朝着在现实世界对话应用中更鲁棒地集成LLM与外部工具的有希望的一步。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in
real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability.
We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM
behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight
distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation,
argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides
targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong
reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its
response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error
categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental
results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic
improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot
prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step
toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue
applications.

TL;DR: BRAINCELL-AID是一个多智能体AI系统，通过整合自由文本描述和本体标签，结合检索增强生成技术，显著提高了基因集注释的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序技术虽然能识别多样细胞类型，但对涉及特征不明确基因的转录组特征进行注释仍然是一个重大挑战。传统方法如GSEA依赖精心策划的注释，在这些情况下表现不佳。

Method: 开发了BRAINCELL-AID多智能体AI系统，整合自由文本描述和本体标签，采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术，通过相关PubMed文献精炼预测，减少幻觉并增强可解释性。

Result: 在鼠类基因集的前几位预测中实现了77%的正确注释率，成功注释了来自BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network生成的5,322个脑细胞簇，识别了区域特异性基因共表达模式并推断基因集合的功能角色。

Conclusion: BRAINCELL-AID创建了一个有价值的资源来支持社区驱动的细胞类型注释，能够识别具有神经学意义描述的基底神经节相关细胞类型。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse
cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these
signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a
major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these
contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but
struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured
ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:
https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that
integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate
and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using
relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing
interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%
of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we
annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell
atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel
insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene
co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.
BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with
neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to
support community-driven cell type annotation.

TL;DR: 开发了两种基于大语言模型的系统用于企业信用评估中的证据推理：单代理系统(NAS)和多代理辩论系统(KPD-MADS)，后者基于卡尔·波普尔的批判对话框架，在推理质量上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业信用评估中定性非财务指标的自动化推理尚未解决，现有方法主要关注数值预测，缺乏对专业贷款评估所需解释性判断的支持。

Method: 开发了两种LLM系统：单代理系统(NAS)通过单次推理管道生成双向分析；多代理辩论系统(KPD-MADS)基于卡尔·波普尔批判对话框架，采用十步结构化交互协议进行对抗性验证。

Result: 两种系统均实现显著生产力提升(NAS:11.55秒/案例；KPD-MADS:91.97秒；人工基准:1920秒)。KPD-MADS在解释充分性(4.0 vs 3.0)、实际适用性(4.0 vs 3.0)和可用性(62.5 vs 52.5)方面获得更高评分。

Conclusion: 结构化多代理交互可以增强金融AI中的推理严谨性和可解释性，推动企业信用评估的可扩展和可辩护自动化。

Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning
remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative
non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes
yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical
prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required
in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two
operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate
structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a
non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis
through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based
multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification
through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's
critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate
cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to
manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains
(NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The
KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median
ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs.
3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured
multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in
financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit
assessment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于手工特征的方法，通过提取和融合颜色统计、多色彩空间直方图以及纹理特征来评估鱼类新鲜度，在FFE数据集上取得了显著优于深度学习基线的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、不一致性和难以标准化的问题，需要开发客观、可靠的自动化评估方法。

Method: 从鱼眼图像中系统提取互补特征描述符，包括颜色统计、多色彩空间直方图、局部二值模式(LBP)和灰度共生矩阵(GLCM)等纹理特征，融合全局色度变化和局部ROI退化特征。

Result: 在标准训练-测试设置下，LightGBM分类器达到77.56%准确率，比之前深度学习基线(63.21%)提升14.35%；使用增强数据时，人工神经网络(ANN)达到97.16%准确率，比之前最佳结果(77.3%)提升19.86%。

Conclusion: 精心设计的手工特征经过战略处理后，能够为自动化鱼类新鲜度评估提供鲁棒、可解释且可靠的解决方案，为食品质量监控的实际应用提供有价值见解。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food
industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and
consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective,
inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by
subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we
propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and
incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics,
histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local
Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish
eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images
and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to
evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's
effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved
77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline
of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached
97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results
demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically
processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated
fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical
applications in food quality monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出PILLM框架，将物理知识融入大语言模型，通过进化循环自动生成、评估和优化HVAC系统异常检测规则，在保持可解释性的同时实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HVAC系统能耗巨大，现有方法要么缺乏适应性（基于规则），要么缺乏透明度和物理合理性（深度学习），LLM方法又忽略了物理原理。

Method: PILLM框架在进化循环中使用物理知识引导的反思和交叉算子，嵌入热力学和控制理论约束，自动生成和优化异常检测规则。

Result: 在公共建筑故障检测数据集上，PILLM达到最先进性能，生成的诊断规则具有可解释性和可操作性。

Conclusion: PILLM推进了智能建筑系统中可信赖和可部署AI的发展，实现了自适应且物理基础扎实的异常检测。

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a
substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly
detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical
rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep
learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency,
efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language
Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore
the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a
Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to
automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our
approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that
embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are
both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault
Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while
producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing
trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模多智能体系统中，通信协议选择对性能和可靠性至关重要，但目前缺乏标准化评估方法，选择往往基于直觉。

Method: 开发ProtocolBench基准，从任务成功率、端到端延迟、消息开销和故障恢复能力四个维度评估协议；提出ProtocolRouter，基于需求和运行时信号动态选择协议。

Result: 协议选择显著影响系统行为：在Streaming Queue场景中，完成时间差异达36.5%，延迟差异3.48秒；ProtocolRouter相比最佳单协议基线，故障恢复时间减少18.1%。

Conclusion: 协议选择对系统性能有重大影响，ProtocolBench和ProtocolRouter为协议评估和选择提供了标准化方法，能显著提升系统可靠性。

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer
has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and
reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora,
etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We
introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent
protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message
or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol
choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue
scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and
mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery,
resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we
present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario
(or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter
reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol
baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA.
We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and
improve reliability at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急性心肌梗死后恶性室性心律失常是院内死亡的主要原因，传统风险评分性能有限，而端到端深度学习模型缺乏临床信任所需的可解释性。

Method: 使用ECGFounder基础模型提取150维诊断概率特征，通过特征选择后训练XGBoost分类器，并用SHAP方法进行可解释性分析。

Result: 混合模型AUC达到0.801，优于KNN(0.677)、RNN(0.676)和1D-CNN(0.720)，SHAP分析显示模型识别特征与临床知识高度一致。

Conclusion: 该混合框架为基础模型输出作为有效自动化特征工程提供了验证，为构建可信赖、可解释的AI临床决策支持系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early
identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have
limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the
interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a
hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram
(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to
improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings
from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder
model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,
which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost
classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the
SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid
model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC
0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that
model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk
predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly
consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework
provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of
foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for
building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

Motivation: 探索在真实用户环境中部署工具增强LLM健康教练的效果，特别关注不同用户群体对工具使用策略的差异化反应，以及如何通过个性化策略避免对特定群体的伤害。

Method: 采用离线策略评估（OPE）分析因子化决策头（工具/风格），使用轻量模拟器与隐藏原型进行测试，添加早期信息增益奖励来优化特征识别。

Result: 统一工具密集型策略在日志上提升平均价值，但损害低健康素养/高自我效能用户群体；添加信息增益奖励可缩短特征识别时间，提高目标成功率和pass@3指标。

Conclusion: 提出了评估优先的个性化路径：冻结生成器，在类型化奖励上学习子群体感知的决策头，并始终报告每个原型的指标以揭示被平均值掩盖的子群体伤害。

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In
a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE)
over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool
policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably
low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with
hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain
bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and
pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to
personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on
typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report
per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

Conclusion: TD-HNODE能够有效解决基于不规则时间事件样本和患者异质性的疾病进展建模挑战，为患者亚表型分析和及时干预提供支持。

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's
disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health
records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2
diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely
interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn
continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event
samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and
pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack
adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex
continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these
limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on
clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and
learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.
TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the
interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and
inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets
demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the
progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Result: 在工具编排方面，相比基础模型召回率提升40.7%，F1分数提升26.6%。用户研究显示高满意度(4.64/5)，参与者更偏好Coinvisor而非通用LLM和现有加密平台(4.62/5)。

Conclusion: Coinvisor通过强化学习驱动的多智能体框架，有效解决了加密货币投资分析中的关键挑战，提供了准确且可操作的投资洞察。

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but
faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data
integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions.
Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across
various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is
time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in
functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on
static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step
reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a
reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical
support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework.
Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools.
Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism
that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data
sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of
dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We
evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and

that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base
model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with
participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto

### [475] [Graph Attention-Guided Search for Dense Multi-Agent Pathfinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17382)
*Rishabh Jain,Keisuke Okumura,Michael Amir,Amanda Prorok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LaGAT框架，将基于图注意力的神经网络启发式(MAGAT)集成到搜索算法LaCAM中，用于解决密集多智能体路径规划问题，在密集场景中优于纯搜索和纯学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集多智能体路径规划(MAPF)问题中，现有方法难以在实时条件下找到接近最优解，即使是当前最先进的规划器也面临挑战。

Method: 开发混合框架LaGAT：1) 增强MAGAT神经网络架构；2) 在目标地图上采用预训练-微调策略；3) 集成死锁检测机制处理不完美的神经引导；4) 将学习到的启发式集成到LaCAM搜索算法中。

Result: LaGAT在密集场景中表现优于纯搜索方法和纯学习方法，证明了混合搜索方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 经过精心设计的混合搜索方法为紧密耦合、具有挑战性的多智能体协调问题提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)
problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners.
To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic
derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a
leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored
learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed.
In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based
and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through
an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of
interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural
guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search
offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent
coordination problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了FBI_LTL，一个用于仿真规划问题的多样化规划器，使用线性时序逻辑定义语义多样性标准，生成语义多样化的计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划器只生成单一计划，可能无法满足代理偏好，现有多样化规划方法可能产生语法不同但语义相同的解决方案。

Method: 利用线性时序逻辑定义语义多样性标准，并将这些基于LTL的多样性模型直接集成到搜索过程中。

Result: 在各种基准测试中，FBI_LTL相比基线方法能生成更多样化的计划。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了在仿真环境中语义引导多样化规划的可行性，为在传统基于模型方法失效的现实非符号领域开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their
objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over
declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely
on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated
plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this
limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner
explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.
$\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define
semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes
meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models
directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the
generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of
existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different
but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various
benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates
more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the
feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based
environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic,
non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于主动推理的路径规划方法，用于智能代理的自主控制，通过构建证据地图和计算变分自由能量来指导代理在探索和利用之间平衡移动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了侦察地理区域并维持共同作战态势图，需要一种能够平衡探索未知区域和跟踪已识别目标的方法。

Method: 使用Dempster-Shafer理论和高斯传感器模型构建生成模型，通过计算变分自由能量来指导代理向最小化自由能量的位置移动。

Result: 该方法能够有效指导代理在地理地图上平衡搜索广阔区域和跟踪已识别目标对象的挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的主动推理路径规划方法成功解决了探索与利用的平衡问题，为智能代理的自主控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous
control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to
maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an
evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,
incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible
target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map
as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses
Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the
agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior
probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all
positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic
probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability
distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level
of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,
we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step
toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the
challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching
extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target
objects.

### [478] [Label Indeterminacy in AI & Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17463)
*Cor Steging,Tadeusz Zbiegień*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 法律机器学习中标签不确定性问题的研究：法律案件结果常受人为干预影响，导致标签不确定性，这会显著影响模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律领域机器学习通常将过去案件结果视为真实标签，但法律结果常受和解、上诉等人为干预影响，造成标签不确定性，需要对此进行专门研究。

Method: 在欧洲人权法院案件分类背景下，研究不同标签构建方法如何影响模型行为，探讨处理标签不确定性的方法。

Result: 研究发现标签构建方式会显著影响模型行为，标签不确定性是AI与法律领域的重要关切点。

Conclusion: 法律机器学习应用需要考虑标签不确定性，虽然存在估算方法，但都基于无法验证的假设，标签不确定性应被视为AI与法律研究中的相关关切。

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically
operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth.
However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not
captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from
a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label
indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or
had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to
account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these
indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In
the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we
show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly
affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant
concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

*Mir Nafis Sharear Shopnil,Sharad Duwal,Abhishek Tyagi,Adiba Mahbub Proma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个推理时、可插拔模型的多模态虚假信息检测框架，通过分解为四个模块：视觉真实性评估、跨模态一致性分析、检索增强的事实核查和校准判断模块，在MMFakeBench验证集上达到81.65% F1分数，显著优于零样本基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络平台上每天有数十亿结合文本和图像的多模态帖子传播虚假信息，超出了人工事实核查的能力。现有的监督检测模型需要领域特定的训练数据，且难以泛化到不同的操纵策略。

Method: MIRAGE框架将多模态验证分解为四个顺序模块：视觉真实性评估检测AI生成图像，跨模态一致性分析识别上下文不当再利用，检索增强事实核查通过迭代问题生成将声明基于网络证据，校准判断模块整合所有信号。

Result: 在MMFakeBench验证集（1,000样本）上，MIRAGE与GPT-4o-mini结合达到81.65% F1分数和75.1%准确率，比最强的零样本基线（GPT-4V与MMD-Agent的74.0% F1）高出7.65点，同时保持34.3%的假阳性率，而仅判断基线的假阳性率为97.3%。测试集结果（5,000样本）确认泛化能力，达到81.44% F1和75.08%准确率。

Conclusion: 分解的代理推理与网络检索可以在不需要领域特定训练的情况下匹配监督检测器的性能，使得在标注数据稀缺的多模态场景中也能进行虚假信息检测。

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily
multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual
fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific
training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We
present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that
decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual
veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency
analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual
checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation,
and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates
vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured
and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples),
MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming
the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65
points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a
judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization
with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification
contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97
points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web
retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific
training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled
data remains scarce.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将大型语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到更小、更高效模型中的方法，通过结构感知损失优化使小模型能够理解解决方案的整体结构而不仅仅是生成token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成需要准确理解提示意图和算法推理能力，而小型语言模型可能缺乏这种推理能力。为了在保持性能的同时实现更高效、更便宜的部署，需要将大型语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到小型模型中。

Method: 通过训练模型模拟大型语言模型的推理和问题解决能力，学习识别正确的解决路径，并通过结构感知损失优化建立问题定义与潜在解决方案之间的结构对应关系。

Result: 实验结果显示，通过廉价且易于实现的过程开发的微调模型在MBPP、MBPP Plus和HumanEval基准测试中，在pass@1、平均数据流和平均语法匹配指标上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将大型语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到小型模型中，使小型模型能够超越token级别的生成，深入理解给定问题的解决方案的整体结构，实现了更高效和经济的部署。

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical
factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code
that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of
passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target
programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires
more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level
and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely
tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed
steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial
in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller
language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities
of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to
deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and
problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution
pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem
definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware
loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation
and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.
Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap
and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model
in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across
the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OG-Rank是一个低延迟的解码器重排序系统，通过池化首词评分和不确定性门控解释步骤，在保持可预测延迟的同时提供强效的排序性能，特别适用于临床订单选择等决策任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生需要实时工作并能解释其选择的排序系统，需要一个低延迟、基于解码器的重排序器。

Method: 采用单解码器方法，结合池化首词评分信号和不确定性门控解释步骤。模型在一次传递中为所有候选评分，仅在列表真正模糊时生成简短的结构化理由。使用专注于困难案例的课程训练。

Result: 在遭遇范围订单选择上表现强劲（快速路径：Recall@1~0.45，nDCG@20~0.625），当门控激活时进一步改善（Recall@1~0.56，nDCG@20~0.699，门控率45%）。编码器基线在效果和灵活性上都落后。

Conclusion: OG-Rank提供了一个实用方案：默认快速排序，在有助于时进行解释，这种模式适用于选择性生成能以可接受成本提高准确性的决策任务。单策略设计简化了部署和预算规划，课程原则可广泛转移。

Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify
their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker,
we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token
scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all
candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when
the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a
curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong
effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45,
nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56,
nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains
under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and
flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain
when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective
generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design
simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend
more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond
clinical order selection.

Motivation: 随着在互联网规模数据上训练的大型语言模型的快速发展，利用LLMs预测现实世界未来事件具有重要潜力，这种新兴范式被称为'LLM-as-a-Prophet'。

Method: 构建了Prophet Arena评估基准，持续收集实时预测任务并将每个任务分解为不同的流水线阶段，以支持受控和大规模实验。

Conclusion: LLMs作为预测工具具有潜力，但需要解决事件召回不准确、数据源误解以及在接近决策时信息聚合速度较慢等瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of
significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With
the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale
data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future
events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper
systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,
we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously
collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline
stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive
forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,
consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also
uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via
LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of
data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when
resolution nears.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用多智能体影响图(MAIDs)作为图形框架来解决多智能体强化学习中的协调问题，设计了基于MAIDs的定向干预范式，并通过因果推理技术PSI实现该范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模多智能体强化学习中，人类对整个系统的全局指导不切实际，而现有的协调机制设计主要依赖经验研究，缺乏易用的研究工具。

Method: 引入多智能体影响图(MAIDs)作为分析框架，设计定向干预范式，仅针对单个目标智能体进行干预，并使用Pre-Strategy Intervention(PSI)因果推理技术实现该范式。

Result: 实验证明了所提出的定向干预方法的有效性，并验证了相关性图分析的结果。

Conclusion: MAIDs提供了一个有效的图形框架来分析和可视化MARL方法，定向干预范式能够缓解全局指导问题，PSI技术能够通过最大化因果效应来实现复合期望结果。

Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards
desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a
human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On
the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on
empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ
multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the
above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to
analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new
interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that
is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance
can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference
technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the
targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class
of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary
task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the
corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance
graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning
paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted
intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

Conclusion: CAM和HyCAM框架能够有效提升大语言模型的多任务适应能力，在保持通用知识的同时实现任务特定优化

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities
but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge
retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while
existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task
scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a
novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of
self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while
preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient
adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our
Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a
shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM
modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,
code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance
improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease
reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

Motivation: 系统研究视觉语言模型失败的原因：是由于未能感知视觉证据，还是未能有效利用已感知的证据。

Method: 通过分析层间注意力动态，发现浅层主要关注文本，深层稀疏但可靠地关注局部证据区域。提出推理时干预方法，通过选择性注意力掩码突出深层证据区域。

Result: 干预方法在LLaVA、Qwen、Gemma和InternVL等多个VLM家族中一致提升了准确性，证明VLMs内部编码了可靠证据但未充分利用。

Conclusion: VLMs编码了可靠的视觉证据但未充分利用，通过使这些信号显式化可以弥合感知与推理之间的差距，提升VLM的诊断理解和可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such
as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct
visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether
these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it
effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow
layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably
attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the
visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term
``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building
on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer
evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no
training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including
LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable
evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can
bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic
understanding and reliability of VLMs.
