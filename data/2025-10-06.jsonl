Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely\non uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to\nincorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches\nimpose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window\nsuppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at\nlimiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near\nimportant events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect\nquery relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module\nfor query-driven long-form video understanding.

In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens.

Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically\ninspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE\ngoverning geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the\ncorresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which\nsurprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential\ngradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for\nimage data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample\ngeneration starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,\nFashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the\nnew scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a\nbiologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,\nfounded on geometric Brownian motion."}

One branch\nsynthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other\nextracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint\nself-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To\naddress regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the\ntarget view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked\nduring training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful\ncues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a\ngeometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking\nstrategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for\ngeometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete\nachieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly\nboosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality."}

A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve\ngeneralization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the\nkernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of\n$O(1/\\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,\nincurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we\nestablish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by\ncarefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only\npolynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the\ndata are NTK separable from the margin $\\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate\nof $\\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \\gamma L^2) / (n \\gamma^2))$, which aligns with the\noptimal SVM-type rate $\\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \\gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent\nfactors.

To address this challenge, we turn to\nrepresentation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing\nfeatures from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target\nthe representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,\ndetector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we\ndefine modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging\nmodality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate\nthe modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context\nAttention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to\npropagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style\narchitectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into\nobject queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that\naligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific\ncontrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and\nQueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer\neffectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained\naltogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal\noverhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward\nrobust multimodality medical object detection.

Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically\ninspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE\ngoverning geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the\ncorresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which\nsurprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential\ngradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for\nimage data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample\ngeneration starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,\nFashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the\nnew scheme.

For difficult\ntasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,\nevaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,\nand only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we\nstudy inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and\nprove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with\n$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting\nand BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),\nwith a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high\nfrequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove\nthat when the sampling budget is $N=\\tilde\\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is\n$O(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}+\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$\nis the coverage coefficient, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error\nof the reward model, and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of\nreward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,\ncertifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal.

Previous methods typically address this by\nmaintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern\nmeaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence.
