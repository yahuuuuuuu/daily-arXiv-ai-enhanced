*Akwasi Asare,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolypSeg-GradCAM是一个可解释的深度学习框架，结合U-Net架构和Grad-CAM方法，用于结直肠息肉分割，在Kvasir-SEG数据集上表现出色，提高了AI辅助结肠镜检查的透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌是全球主要的癌症死亡原因之一，胃肠道息肉是关键前兆。早期准确分割息肉对降低癌症进展至关重要，但手动分割劳动密集且存在观察者变异性。现有深度学习方法虽然有效但缺乏可解释性，阻碍了临床应用。

Method: 提出PolypSeg-GradCAM框架，集成U-Net分割架构和梯度加权类激活映射(Grad-CAM)技术，在包含1000张标注内窥镜图像的Kvasir-SEG数据集上进行训练和评估。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到平均交并比(IoU)0.9257，训练和验证集上Dice系数(F-score)均超过0.96。Grad-CAM可视化证实预测基于临床相关区域。

Conclusion: PolypSeg-GradCAM通过结合高分割精度和可解释性，朝着可靠、可信的AI辅助结肠镜检查和改善早期结直肠癌预防迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as
critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and
accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing
CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to
observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential
for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a
barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an
explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp
segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of
1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust
segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96)
on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that
predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency
and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with
interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable,
trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer
prevention.

### [3] [Self Identity Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18165)
*Xiuding Cai,Yaoyao Zhu,Linjie Fu,Dong Miao,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SIM（自身份映射）正则化框架，通过逆映射机制重构输入来减少前向传播中的信息损失，并开发了计算高效的ρSIM版本，在多个任务中提升表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法依赖启发式规则，在不同设置下效果不稳定，需要一种更可靠的数据内在正则化方法。

Method: SIM通过从变换后的输出重构输入来增强表示学习，ρSIM采用补丁级特征采样和基于投影的方法重构潜在特征以降低复杂度。

Result: 在图像分类、少样本提示学习和领域泛化等任务中，ρSIM相比基线方法取得一致改进，并能与现有正则化方法正交结合提升效果。

Conclusion: SIM作为模型无关、任务无关的正则化器，可无缝集成到不同网络架构和任务中，有效保留语义信息并提升性能。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and
mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on
heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We
propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic
regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance
representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed
output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates
smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate
SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and
projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering
complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be
seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to
different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image
classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization.
Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods,
highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning
across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal
to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our
results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic
information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic
segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including
audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.

*Zhanting Zhou,Jinbo Wang,Zeqin Wu,Fengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIA是一种基于动量的自适应梯度反演攻击方法，能够在单轮平均梯度SAG机制下实现高保真多图像重建，无需标签信息且计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在具有挑战性的单轮平均梯度SAG机制下的梯度反演问题，其中每个样本的线索都纠缠在单个批次平均梯度中，需要开发新的方法来感知潜在的每图像信号。

Method: 提出MAGIA框架，包含两个核心创新：1）封闭形式的组合重缩放，创建可证明更紧的优化边界；2）基于动量的整体批次和子集损失混合，确保重建鲁棒性。通过探测随机数据子集来感知潜在图像信号。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAGIA显著优于先进方法，在先前方法失败的大批次场景中实现了高保真多图像重建，且计算足迹与标准求解器相当，无需任何辅助信息。

Conclusion: MAGIA框架成功解决了单轮平均梯度SAG机制下的梯度反演挑战，提供了一种有效且高效的图像重建解决方案。

Abstract: We study gradient inversion in the challenging single round averaged gradient
SAG regime where per sample cues are entangled within a single batch mean
gradient. We introduce MAGIA a momentum based adaptive correction on gradient
inversion attack a novel label inference free framework that senses latent per
image signals by probing random data subsets. MAGIA objective integrates two
core innovations 1 a closed form combinatorial rescaling that creates a
provably tighter optimization bound and 2 a momentum based mixing of whole
batch and subset losses to ensure reconstruction robustness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MAGIA significantly outperforms advanced methods
achieving high fidelity multi image reconstruction in large batch scenarios
where prior works fail. This is all accomplished with a computational footprint
comparable to standard solvers and without requiring any auxiliary information.

### [5] [Baseer: A Vision-Language Model for Arabic Document-to-Markdown OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18174)
*Khalil Hennara,Muhammad Hreden,Mohamed Motasim Hamed,Ahmad Bastati,Zeina Aldallal,Sara Chrouf,Safwan AlModhayan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Baseer是一个专门针对阿拉伯语文档OCR的视觉语言模型，通过大规模数据集和解码器微调策略，显著优于现有解决方案，在阿拉伯语OCR领域达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语文档OCR由于草书字体、多样化字体、变音符号和从右到左的书写方向而具有挑战性。现有的多模态大语言模型在高资源语言上表现良好，但在阿拉伯语上性能有限。

Method: 使用结合合成和真实世界文档的大规模数据集，采用解码器微调策略对预训练的MLLM进行适配，同时保留通用视觉特征。还提出了Misraj-DocOCR基准用于评估。

Result: Baseer显著优于现有的开源和商业解决方案，实现了0.25的WER，在阿拉伯语文档OCR领域建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，对通用MLLM进行领域特定适配具有显著优势，为像阿拉伯语这样的形态丰富语言的高精度OCR建立了强大基准。

Abstract: Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive
script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding
for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In
this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned
specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset
combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a
decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving
general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality,
expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR
systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing
open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing
a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results
highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs
and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich
languages like Arabic.

*Sherwin Bahmani,Tianchang Shen,Jiawei Ren,Jiahui Huang,Yifeng Jiang,Haithem Turki,Andrea Tagliasacchi,David B. Lindell,Zan Gojcic,Sanja Fidler,Huan Ling,Jun Gao,Xuanchi Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自蒸馏框架，将视频扩散模型中的隐式3D知识蒸馏到显式的3D高斯泼溅表示中，无需多视图训练数据即可生成3D场景


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的3D重建方法依赖真实世界多视图数据，但这些数据并不总是可用。视频扩散模型具有强大的想象力，但其2D特性限制了在机器人导航等需要3D环境的模拟应用

Method: 通过在RGB解码器基础上增加3D高斯泼溅解码器，该解码器由RGB解码器的输出进行监督训练。框架可以使用视频扩散模型生成的合成数据进行纯训练，支持从文本提示或单张图像实时渲染3D场景，并可扩展到从单目视频生成动态3D场景

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在静态和动态3D场景生成方面达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 提出的自蒸馏框架成功地将视频扩散模型的2D想象力转化为实用的3D表示，为物理AI应用提供了无需多视图数据的3D环境生成解决方案

Abstract: The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications
ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods
rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not
always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have
shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the
applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with
the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that
aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an
explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for
multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with
a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this
approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated
by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D
scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our
framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input
video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

### [7] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18176)
*Wendong Yao,Saeed Azadnejad,Binhua Huang,Shane Donohue,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的深度学习框架，将稀疏的InSAR时间序列数据转换为密集的时空张量，首次实现了将先进计算机视觉架构直接应用于地面变形预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测地面位移对城市基础设施稳定性和减轻地质灾害至关重要，但从稀疏的InSAR时间序列数据预测未来变形仍是一个重大挑战。

Method: 设计并实现了一种混合CNN-LSTM模型，专门用于从生成的数据张量中同时学习空间模式和时间依赖性，并与LightGBM和LASSO回归等机器学习基线进行性能比较。

Result: 结果表明，所提出的架构提供了显著更准确和空间一致的预测，为该任务建立了新的性能基准。可解释性分析显示基线模型往往默认使用简单的持续性模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果证实了时空深度学习在高分辨率变形预测中的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability
and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from
sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning
framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense
spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time,
the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this
forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural
Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to
simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the
generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful
machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO
regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate
that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and
spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this
task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models
often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of
our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of
ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of
spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

*George Corrêa de Araújo,Helena de Almeida Maia,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scrapbook框架是一种生成数据集的新方法，用于探究AI模型学习到的概念，重点关注对象识别、位置关系和属性识别等基础概念。实验发现当前模型在位置理解和约束性问题方面存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要验证AI模型对基本概念的理解，为处理更复杂任务奠定基础。通过生成大量具有语言变体的问题数据集来系统评估模型性能。

Method: 提出Scrapbook框架，生成包含大量关于单个概念的问题和广泛语言变体的数据集，重点关注对象识别、绝对和相对位置、属性识别等基础概念。

Result: 当代模型在对象识别和枚举方面表现良好，但在理解位置信息和处理有额外约束的问题时遇到困难。MobileVLM-V2模型显示出显著答案分歧和错误答案，其他模型存在肯定答案偏见，在几何形状和位置信息问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Scrapbook框架为生成多样化综合数据集提供了有价值的工具，可用于系统评估和提升AI模型性能，揭示了模型在理解一致性和位置信息方面的改进空间。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology
designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of
artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental
concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and
attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of
questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the
Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic
elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal
that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and
enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional
information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically,
the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible
wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers
and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional
information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency.
The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and
comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and
enhance the performance of AI models.

### [9] [The Describe-Then-Generate Bottleneck: How VLM Descriptions Alter Image Generation Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18179)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过实证分析量化了视觉-语言-视觉管道中描述-生成瓶颈导致的信息损失，发现99.3%的样本存在显著感知退化，91.5%存在显著结构信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态AI系统在创意工作流中的集成增加，理解视觉-语言-视觉管道中的信息损失对于评估系统局限性变得重要，但目前通过文本中介传递视觉内容时的退化程度缺乏量化研究。

Method: 生成了150对通过描述-生成管道的图像对，应用现有指标（LPIPS、SSIM和颜色距离）来测量感知、结构和色彩维度上的信息保存情况。

Result: 评估显示99.3%的样本表现出显著的感知退化，91.5%的样本表现出显著的结构信息损失。

Conclusion: 描述-生成瓶颈代表了当代多模态系统中可测量且一致的局限性，提供了该瓶颈导致信息损失的实证证据。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of multimodal AI systems in creative
workflows, understanding information loss in vision-language-vision pipelines
has become important for evaluating system limitations. However, the
degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual
intermediation remains poorly quantified. In this work, we provide empirical
analysis of the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language
serves as an intermediate representation for visual information. We generated
150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied
existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information
preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our
evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual
degradation and 91.5% demonstrate significant structural information loss,
providing empirical evidence that the describe-then-generate bottleneck
represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种AI驱动的工作流程，利用高分辨率卫星影像自动推断屋顶属性，以解决小岛屿发展中国家建筑结构数据缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多气候脆弱地区的小岛屿发展中国家缺乏详细的建筑结构信息，这限制了城市韧性规划和灾害风险评估的能力。

Method: 比较了地理空间基础模型结合浅层分类器与微调深度学习模型在屋顶分类中的效果，并评估了整合邻近国家训练数据对模型性能的影响。

Result: 最佳模型在屋顶坡度和屋顶材料分类上分别达到了0.88和0.83的F1分数。

Conclusion: 结合本地能力建设，该工作旨在为小岛屿发展中国家提供利用AI和地球观测数据进行高效、基于证据的城市治理的新能力。

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage
from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical
for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such
information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS)
in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we
present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from
high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our
case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models
combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for
rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating
additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance.
Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof
material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building,
our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth
Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban
governance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VLA-LPAF模块来解决VLA模型在多视角视觉观察中的视角异构性问题，通过在潜在空间融合多视角数据，显著提升任务成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在处理不同环境和视角的视觉观察时存在视角异构性问题，限制了模型的泛化能力

Method: 提出轻量级模块VLA-LPAF，使用单视角图像进行微调，在潜在空间融合多视角观察数据

Result: 在CALVIN、LIBERO和定制仿真基准上分别实现约8%、15%和30%的任务成功率提升

Conclusion: VLA-LPAF有效解决了VLA模型的视角适应性问题，在真实世界任务中展现出良好的视角自适应特性

Abstract: The Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models can follow text instructions
according to visual observations of the surrounding environment. This ability
to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA
model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured
by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in
number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant
differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains
the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the
lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models
using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and
fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and
efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate
our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct
RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves
around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a
customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive
characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.

In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware refinement network called URNet
for event-based stereo depth estimation. Our approach features a local-global
refinement module that effectively captures fine-grained local details and
long-range global context. Additionally, we introduce a Kullback-Leibler (KL)

quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Endometriosis often leads to chronic pelvic pain and possible nerve
involvement, yet imaging the peripheral nerves remains a challenge. We
introduce Visionerves, a novel hybrid AI framework for peripheral nervous
system recognition from multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. Unlike
conventional tractography, Visionerves encodes anatomical knowledge through
fuzzy spatial relationships, removing the need for selection of manual ROIs.
The pipeline comprises two phases: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical
structures using a deep learning model, and (B) tractography and nerve
recognition by symbolic spatial reasoning. Applied to the lumbosacral plexus in
10 women with (confirmed or suspected) endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated
substantial improvements over standard tractography, with Dice score
improvements of up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5 mm. This
automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and paves
the way for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy, as well
as other conditions with nerve involvement.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge, particularly
in countries with heterogeneous road conditions, mixed traffic flow, and
variable driving discipline, such as Pakistan. Reliable detection of unsafe

in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the
developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity
observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the
privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving
multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani
driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS
sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving
behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads,
including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered
using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency
accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all
sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this
work is on the data acquisition process, covering participant selection,
driving scenarios, environmental considerations, and sensor video
synchronization techniques. The dataset is structured into raw, processed, and
semantic layers, ensuring adaptability for future research in driver behaviour
classification, traffic safety analysis, and ADAS development. By representing
real world driving in Pakistan, V-SenseDrive fills a critical gap in the global
landscape of driver behaviour datasets and lays the groundwork for context
aware intelligent transportation solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HazeFlow是一个基于ODE的去雾框架，将大气散射模型重新表述为常微分方程，通过单次推理实现真实世界图像去雾，解决了传统方法在真实场景中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法因缺乏配对的真实世界训练数据和领域差距，在真实场景去雾中泛化能力不足。传统基于大气散射模型的物理方法难以处理真实世界的复杂性和多样雾霾模式。

Method: 提出HazeFlow框架，将大气散射模型重新表述为ODE，借鉴Rectified Flow思想学习从雾霾图像到清晰图像的最优ODE轨迹。同时引入基于马尔可夫链布朗运动的非均匀雾霾生成方法，模拟真实雾霾模式。

Result: 在多个真实世界去雾基准数据集上，HazeFlow实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: HazeFlow通过ODE框架和真实雾霾模拟方法，有效提升了真实世界图像去雾的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Dehazing involves removing haze or fog from images to restore clarity and
improve visibility by estimating atmospheric scattering effects. While deep
learning methods show promise, the lack of paired real-world training data and
the resulting domain gap hinder generalization to real-world scenarios. In this
context, physics-grounded learning becomes crucial; however, traditional
methods based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) often fall short in
handling real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns. To solve this
problem, we propose HazeFlow, a novel ODE-based framework that reformulates ASM
as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Inspired by Rectified Flow (RF),
HazeFlow learns an optimal ODE trajectory to map hazy images to clean ones,
enhancing real-world dehazing performance with only a single inference step.
Additionally, we introduce a non-homogeneous haze generation method using
Markov Chain Brownian Motion (MCBM) to address the scarcity of paired
real-world data. By simulating realistic haze patterns through MCBM, we enhance
the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 医学诊断日益依赖多模态数据，需要模型能够有效融合异构信息并保持对缺失模态的鲁棒性，解决现实世界中的模态不平衡和缺失限制。

Method: 引入可学习的模态token来改进缺失感知的模态融合，并在传统单模态对比目标基础上增强融合的多模态表示，结合增强模态dropout和对比学习技术。

Result: 在大规模临床数据集上的实验表明，该方法在疾病检测和预测任务中达到最先进性能，特别是在仅单一模态可用的实际场景中表现优异，并能成功集成到CT基础模型中。

Abstract: As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning
models are expected to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while
remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel
multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and
contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality
imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens
for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional
unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We
validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection
and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a
single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through
successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings
highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach
for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with
significant potential for real-world clinical applications. The code is

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了9种分割架构在肺栓塞CTPA扫描上的表现，发现3D U-Net ResNet在PE分割中效果最佳，CNN模型优于ViT，分类预训练可能对分割性能产生负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺栓塞（PE）是心血管疾病死亡的主要原因，准确分割对于诊断和治疗至关重要。目前缺乏对不同分割架构在PE任务上的系统性比较研究。

Method: 使用490个CTPA扫描的内部数据集，在统一测试框架下评估9种CNN和ViT分割架构，比较预训练和随机初始化权重的影响。

Result: 最佳模型达到0.7131的Dice分数，在60个测试扫描中检测到181个栓塞，49个假阳性和28个假阴性。3D模型和CNN架构表现优于ViT。

Conclusion: 3D U-Net ResNet是PE分割的有效架构，远端栓塞分割仍具挑战性，PE分类和分割可能依赖不同的判别特征。

Abstract: In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490
CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used
segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)
families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified
testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important
observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective
architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to
this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based
models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based
counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on
large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to
training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may
rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model
architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when
trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be
segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to
both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these
findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for
segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false
negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further
validated on public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手形在手语中具有基础音系学作用，但计算方法很少明确建模手形，限制了识别准确性和语言分析。

Method: 结合解剖学信息图结构和对比学习，解决手形识别中的关键挑战，包括细微的类间差异和时间变化。

Result: 在签名序列中建立了首个结构化手形识别基准，准确率达到46%（基线方法为25%）。

Abstract: Handshapes serve a fundamental phonological role in signed languages, with
American Sign Language employing approximately 50 distinct shapes.
However,computational approaches rarely model handshapes explicitly, limiting
both recognition accuracy and linguistic analysis.We introduce a novel graph
neural network that separates temporal dynamics from static handshape
configurations. Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures
with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition,
including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish
the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences,
achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods
achieving 25%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了在胎儿超声图像中，分类任务本身对OOD检测性能的影响，发现OOD检测效果随任务变化，且最佳任务取决于ID-OOD标准（图像特征偏移或解剖特征偏移）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的外分布检测对于在异质性图像特征和临床环境中安全部署深度学习模型至关重要。现有研究主要关注不确定性量化方法，但本文探讨分类任务本身的影响。

Method: 通过四个分类任务和八种不确定性量化方法的实验，分析OOD检测性能与任务选择的关系。

Result: OOD检测性能显著随任务变化，最佳任务取决于ID-OOD标准（图像特征偏移或解剖特征偏移）。优越的OOD检测并不保证最优的弃权预测。

Conclusion: 在医学图像分析中，需要将任务选择和不确定性策略与具体下游应用对齐。

Abstract: Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment
of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image
characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a
classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples.
While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification
methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself.
Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four
classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance
significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the
defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an
image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we
reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained
prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty
strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OrthoLoC数据集，这是首个大规模无人机图像与正射地理数据配对的数据集，用于解决资源受限环境下的高精度视觉定位问题，并引入了AdHoP优化技术提升特征匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无互联网或GPS支持的资源受限场景下，现有视觉定位系统依赖大型图像数据库或重型3D模型不切实际。正射地理数据轻量且易得，但缺乏专门的数据集来研究无人机图像与地理数据之间的领域偏移问题。

Method: 创建包含16,425张德国和美国无人机图像的多模态数据集，采用配对结构将图像检索与特征匹配解耦。提出AdHoP优化技术，可与任何特征匹配器集成，通过改进匹配提升定位精度。

Result: 数据集支持公平基准测试，全面评估了领域偏移、数据分辨率和共视性对定位精度的影响。AdHoP技术将匹配性能提升高达95%，平移误差降低高达63%。

Conclusion: OrthoLoC填补了正射地理数据在视觉定位应用中的空白，为资源受限环境下的高精度定位提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with
applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue
operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision
localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet
connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D
models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging
orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and
increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g.,
the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first
large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United
States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between
UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking
of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching,
allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance.
Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data
resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a
refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature
matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up
to 63%. The dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: SSDnet是一种零样本单图像异常定位方法，利用卷积神经网络的归纳偏置进行自重构，无需外部训练数据或参考样本即可检测图像中的异常区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中缺乏训练数据的问题，仅使用测试图像本身进行异常检测，适用于无法获取训练样本的零样本场景。

Method: 设计基于patch的训练框架，直接输入图像进行自重构（而非DIP的随机噪声映射），通过掩码、patch打乱和高斯噪声避免恒等映射，使用基于内积相似度的感知损失。

Result: 在MVTec-AD数据集上达到0.99 AUROC和0.60 AUPRC，在fabric数据集上达到0.98 AUROC和0.67 AUPRC，优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: SSDnet无需外部训练数据、标签或参考样本，在噪声或像素缺失情况下仍保持鲁棒性，为单图像异常定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from
collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many
real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only
the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by
proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the
inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior
(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key
assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,
and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or
stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based
training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for
self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in
DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,
patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual
loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel
fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,
and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves
0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the
fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code
will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对低资源孟加拉语的视觉-语言模型，通过三损失目标（PAL+InfoNCE+OT）改善图像与文本的对齐，在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如孟加拉语）中视觉-语言模型存在的挑战：配对数据稀缺、翻译对齐断裂以及英语中心预训练忽略目标语言语义的问题。

Method: 使用LaBSE验证的英-孟配对数据和11万张双语提示合成图像训练管道。采用冻结的MaxViT提取视觉特征，孟加拉语原生mBART-50解码，轻量级桥接模块连接模态。核心创新是三损失目标：PAL对齐真实和合成补丁描述符，InfoNCE强制全局分离，Sinkhorn-based OT确保细粒度补丁对应。

Result: 在Flickr30k-1k（BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR 27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20）和MSCOCO-1k（BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14, BERTScore-F1 75.40）上表现优异，超越强CE基线，并将真实-合成质心差距缩小41%。

Conclusion: 提出的三损失协同方法有效改善了低资源语言的视觉-语言对齐，减少了虚假匹配，为低资源语言的多模态建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains
challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This
stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and
English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address
this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified
EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT
yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a
lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss
objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch
descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global
real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained
patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces
spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR
27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14,
BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the
real--synthetic centroid gap by 41%.

Abstract: We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework
that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher
(UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient
camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the
complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting,
occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined
28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD
[19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines
feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to
effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV
representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08
minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x
faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that
full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained
settings, bridging the gap between large-scale, multi-modal perception-planning
models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy.

Conclusion: 利用运动模糊信息不仅能提高检测精度，还能增强轨迹预测能力，有利于实时体育分析应用。

Abstract: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for
detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as
streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the
ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring
valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new
labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and
explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new
table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach
consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore,
we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion
blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as
Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy
but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time
sports analytics.

Conclusion: 压缩域传播是减少检测器调用次数同时保持强大零样本覆盖能力的实用方法。

Abstract: Running a large open-vocabulary (Open-vocab) detector on every video frame is
accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes
OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to
intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3
grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale
updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class
switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt
list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset),
our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise
OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse
localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP
outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A
supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled
training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These
results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to
reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

*Zitian Zhang,Joshua Urban Davis,Jeanne Phuong Anh Vu,Jiangtao Kuang,Jean-François Lalonde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究高动态范围（HDR）光照估计方法的颜色鲁棒性，提出使用预训练白平衡网络预处理输入图像来提升现有模型颜色准确性的简单适配技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR光照估计方法在颜色鲁棒性方面存在不足，这是一个常被忽视但对实现视觉真实感至关重要的因素。大多数评估将颜色与其他光照属性混为一谈，而本研究将颜色作为主要关注变量。

Method: 不引入新的光照估计算法，而是探索简单的适配技术能否增强现有模型的颜色准确性。使用包含多样化光照颜色的新型HDR数据集，系统评估多种适配策略，特别是使用预训练白平衡网络预处理输入图像的方法。

Result: 结果显示，使用预训练白平衡网络预处理输入图像的方法在所有测试场景中都优于其他策略，显著提升了颜色鲁棒性。该方法无需重新训练光照估计模型，并在三种最先进的光照估计方法上验证了其通用性。

Conclusion: 简单的预处理技术（如白平衡）可以有效提升现有HDR光照估计方法的颜色准确性，为增强现实应用提供更真实的渲染效果，且无需复杂的模型重新训练。

Abstract: Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image
have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications.
Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for
the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we
investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet
critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate
color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate
color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new
lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques
can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset
featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several
adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with
a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming
other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires
no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the
generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art
lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视觉语言模型和多模态大语言模型的免训练支票字段检测框架，实现零样本检测支票关键字段，解决传统方法依赖大规模标注数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支票在金融交易中广泛使用但易受欺诈，传统检测方法依赖大量标注数据，而这类数据因隐私和专有性问题难以获取，需要开发免训练的高效检测方案。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和多模态大语言模型(MLLM)，构建无需训练的自动化支票字段检测框架，能够零样本识别签名、MICR线、金额等关键字段。

Result: 在包含110张不同格式支票的手工标注数据集上评估，模型表现出强大的性能和泛化能力，可作为生成高质量标注数据的引导机制。

Conclusion: 该框架显著降低了金融场景中部署支票欺诈检测的门槛，并能作为开发专用实时目标检测模型的基础工具。

Abstract: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem,
facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However,
their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud,
underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the
core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of
critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition
(MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are
essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the
same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object
detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets,
a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this
paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field
detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction
with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot
detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment
in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a
hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts
demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore,
this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality
labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object
detection models tailored to institutional needs.

TL;DR: 本文评估了视觉语言模型在图表理解中的表现，发现现有模型在图表失真或遮挡情况下性能显著下降，并出现幻觉问题。作者提出了CHART NOISe数据集来测试模型在噪声和遮挡条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解基准假设图表清晰且查询基于事实，但现实世界图表常包含失真且需要复杂推理。需要评估模型在退化条件下的表现。

Method: 评估ChatGPT 4o、Claude Sonnet 4和Gemini 2.5 Pro在图表失真和遮挡条件下的表现，引入CHART NOISe数据集（包含图表损坏、遮挡和反向不一致性测试），并提出质量过滤和遮挡检测等缓解策略。

Result: 模型在图表损坏或遮挡条件下性能急剧下降，幻觉问题（如数值捏造、趋势误解和实体混淆）更加频繁，模型在退化设置下仍过度自信。

Conclusion: 建立了严格的测试基准，揭示了图表推理中的系统性漏洞，为提升图表理解的鲁棒性和可靠性提供了基础。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet
existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world
charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching.
We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp
performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as
value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more
frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating
plausible but unsupported explanations.
  To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers,
and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset
combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice
questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt
reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm
versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in
chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying
corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline
mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection.
Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness
and reliability in chart understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于神经表示的4D-MRI重建方法，用连续变形模型替代传统离散排序方法，通过空间解剖网络和时间运动网络实现高效、准确的呼吸运动捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4D-MRI重建方法依赖相位分箱或单独模板扫描，难以捕捉时间变异性，工作流程复杂且计算负担重。

Method: 使用两个协同网络：空间解剖网络编码连续3D解剖表示，时间运动网络基于Transformer衍生呼吸信号生成时间一致的变形场。

Result: 在19名志愿者自由呼吸数据集上验证，该方法能准确捕捉规则和不规则呼吸模式，处理时间从5小时减少到15分钟训练，单次3D体积推断时间小于1秒。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了效率，实现了任意呼吸状态下3D图像的准确重建，在4D放射治疗规划和实时自适应治疗中具有强大应用潜力。

Abstract: Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing
respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery.
Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning
or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability,
complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a
neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth,
continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing
the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion
modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the
Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical
representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by
Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent
deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers
demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both
regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and
bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method
significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from
approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to
just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D
volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at
any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional
methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation
therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了五种基于卡尔曼滤波的跟踪方法在快速移动微小物体（如壁球）跟踪中的性能，发现DeepOCSORT在跟踪精度上表现最佳，但所有方法都存在显著的跟踪漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速移动微小物体的不可预测运动模式和小视觉标记使得精确跟踪成为计算机视觉中的挑战性问题，特别是在体育机器人应用中需要轻量级且准确的跟踪系统。

Method: 使用包含10,000个标注壁球帧的自定义数据集，评估了OCSORT、DeepOCSORT、ByteTrack、BoTSORT和StrongSORT五种卡尔曼滤波跟踪方法，重点分析推理速度和每图像更新频率对跟踪精度的影响。

Result: DeepOCSORT实现了最低的跟踪误差（平均ADE 31.15像素），而ByteTrack处理速度最快（平均推理时间26.6ms）。但所有跟踪器都表现出显著的跟踪漂移，空间误差在3-11cm之间。

Conclusion: 当前基于卡尔曼滤波的跟踪方法在处理快速移动微小物体的不可预测运动模式时存在根本性局限，误差率比标准物体跟踪基准高3-4倍，需要开发专门的跟踪方法。

Abstract: Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking
of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems
in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics
applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot
perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking
methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their
performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects
that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking
methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom
dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p
resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors:
inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters
affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our
experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT
achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared
to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest
processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms.
However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit
significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values:
31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the
unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs.
Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial
improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking
benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving
tiny object tracking applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频动作识别方法计算成本高，压缩域处理可以降低计算开销。MoCrop旨在利用压缩视频中已有的运动信息，实现高效的动作识别。

Method: MoCrop包含去噪合并(DM)、蒙特卡洛采样(MCS)和自适应裁剪(AC)三个轻量级组件，通过运动密度子矩阵搜索生成鲁棒的裁剪区域，无需额外训练参数。

Result: 在UCF101数据集上，MoCrop在ResNet-50上实现+3.5%的Top-1准确率提升（同等计算量），或+2.4%准确率提升同时减少26.5%计算量。在CoViAR上达到89.2%准确率，同时将计算量从11.6降至8.5 GFLOPs。

Conclusion: MoCrop具有强泛化能力，在多种骨干网络上均表现一致，适用于压缩域实时部署，为高效视频动作识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce MoCrop, a motion-aware adaptive cropping module for efficient
video action recognition in the compressed domain. MoCrop uses motion vectors
that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a
single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module
is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse
backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte
Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix
search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves
accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy
at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer
FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy
at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6
to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B
indicate strong generality and make MoCrop practical for real-time deployment
in the compressed domain. Our code and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低比特率条件下性能不佳，因为它们保留过多冗余细节或学习过度集中的符号分布

Method: 使用向量量化将连续视觉特征映射到离散索引，通过码本选择性传输特征，保留更多信息性视觉模式

Result: 在速率和准确性方面表现出优越性，特别是在低比特率条件下更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: CAFC-SE框架有效解决了低比特率条件下的特征压缩问题，提升了边缘-云系统的分析性能

Abstract: Coding images for machines with minimal bitrate and strong analysis
performance is key to effective edge-cloud systems. Several approaches deploy
an image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods
compress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform
analysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform
poorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or
learn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a
Codebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic
Enhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete
indices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and
selectively transmits them to the cloud. The VQ operation that projects feature
vectors onto the nearest visual primitives enables us to preserve more
informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. Hence, CAFC-SE is
less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method in terms of rate and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中现有方法计算复杂度高、参数量大，难以在资源受限环境中部署的问题

Method: 设计多核深度卷积块(MKDC)处理多分辨率空间关系，结合通道、空间和分组门控注意力机制突出图像显著特征

Result: 仅需0.316M参数和0.314G FLOPs，在六个医学图像基准测试中DICE分数优于TransUNet、UNeXt等SOTA方法，参数量减少333倍

Conclusion: MK-UNet为资源受限环境提供了实时、高保真医学诊断的无与伦比解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MK-UNet, a paradigm shift towards
ultra-lightweight, multi-kernel U-shaped CNNs tailored for medical image
segmentation. Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution
block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels,
while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also
emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention
mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our
MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M
parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but
also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy
over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging
benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with
nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively.
Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation
performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with
4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent
lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with
much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with
drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for
real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such
as point-of-care devices. Our implementation is available at

rigs 3D Gaussians to a CT mesh, enabling joint optimization of Gaussian
parameters and mesh deformation through photometric supervision. By
parametrizing each Gaussian relative to its parent mesh triangle, we enforce
alignment between Gaussians and mesh and obtain deformations that can be
propagated back to update the CT. We demonstrate BridgeSplat's effectiveness on
visceral pig surgeries and synthetic data of a human liver under simulation,
showing sensible deformations of the preoperative CT on monocular RGB data.

Conclusion: DGLE框架通过扩散模型引导的标签富集策略，为源自由领域自适应的语义分割任务提供了一种有效的伪标签优化解决方案。

Abstract: Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of
remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how
to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is
inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.
Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many
high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.
Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more
supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain
substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This
limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus
restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel
pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment
(DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and
propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality
of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on
confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which
utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a
small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage
the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular
distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed
noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby
generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively
avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,
significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the
model's performance in the target domain.

Motivation: 双曲空间相比欧几里得空间对分层数据具有更好的表示能力，特别是在粗到细的少样本类增量学习任务中，需要更好地处理层次化类别结构。

Result: 在C2FSCIL基准测试中，该方法有效提高了粗类和细类分类的准确率。

Conclusion: 双曲空间嵌入为C2FSCIL任务提供了有效的解决方案，通过层次化表示和特征增强显著提升了少样本学习性能。

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior
representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional
Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot
Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe
approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently
normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the
embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose
embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ
the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor
to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball
instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss
and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and
classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under
few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic
space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors.
This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate
overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL
benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class
accuracies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种几何感知的两阶段框架GeoRemover，用于智能图像编辑中的物体移除，不仅能移除目标物体，还能消除其因果视觉伪影（如阴影和反射）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像外观的方法存在局限性：严格掩码对齐的方法无法移除未明确掩码的因果效果，而松散掩码对齐的方法缺乏可控性且可能过度擦除其他物体。这些限制源于忽略了物体几何存在与其视觉效果之间的因果关系。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 几何移除阶段：使用严格掩码对齐监督直接从几何（如深度）中移除物体；2) 外观渲染阶段：基于更新的几何条件渲染真实感RGB图像。引入基于正负样本对的偏好驱动目标来指导几何移除学习。

Result: 在两个流行基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在移除物体及其相关伪影方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦几何移除和外观渲染，GeoRemover能够有效处理物体移除中的因果视觉伪影问题，实现了更好的可控性和编辑质量。

Abstract: Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the
target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections.
However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly
mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not
explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack
controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify
that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an
object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,
we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal
into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we
remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly
mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong
geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB
image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are
considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide
learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven
objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to
remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new
structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their
associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks. The code is available at

Result: 在CLIVE数据集上的实验结果表明SEGA具有优越的迁移性，能够成功实现基于迁移的黑盒攻击。

Conclusion: SEGA是首个针对NR-IQA模型低迁移性问题的解决方案，为揭示模型脆弱性和指导鲁棒系统设计提供了有效工具。

Abstract: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models play an important role
in various real-world applications. Recently, adversarial attacks against
NR-IQA models have attracted increasing attention, as they provide valuable
insights for revealing model vulnerabilities and guiding robust system design.
Some effective attacks have been proposed against NR-IQA models in white-box
settings, where the attacker has full access to the target model. However,
these attacks often suffer from poor transferability to unknown target models
in more realistic black-box scenarios, where the target model is inaccessible.
This work makes the first attempt to address the challenge of low
transferability in attacking NR-IQA models by proposing a transferable Signed
Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA). The main idea is to approximate the
gradient of the target model by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models
and ensembling their smoothed gradients. To ensure the imperceptibility of
adversarial perturbations, SEGA further removes inappropriate perturbations
using a specially designed perturbation filter mask. Experimental results on
the CLIVE dataset demonstrate the superior transferability of SEGA, validating
its effectiveness in enabling successful transfer-based black-box attacks
against NR-IQA models.

*Mohammad Junayed Hasan,Nabeel Mohammed,Shafin Rahman,Philipp Koehn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaSmileNet是一个新颖的特征融合框架，通过参数自由的Hadamard乘法交互直接整合基于transformer的表征和生理学基础的D-Marker特征，在微笑面部情感识别任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务学习框架在结合深度学习架构和手工D-Marker特征时存在计算效率低下的问题，需要辅助任务监督和复杂的损失平衡。

Method: 提出HadaSmileNet框架，系统评估了15种融合策略，发现Hadamard乘法融合能够实现直接特征交互同时保持计算效率。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上取得了最先进的结果：UvA-NEMO（88.7%，+0.8）、MMI（99.7%）、SPOS（98.5%，+0.7）和BBC（100%，+5.0），参数减少26%，训练过程简化。

Conclusion: 该框架的高效性和有效性使其特别适合需要实时情感计算能力的多媒体数据挖掘应用的实际部署。

Abstract: The distinction between genuine and posed emotions represents a fundamental
pattern recognition challenge with significant implications for data mining
applications in social sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.
While recent multi-task learning frameworks have shown promise in combining
deep learning architectures with handcrafted D-Marker features for smile facial
emotion recognition, these approaches exhibit computational inefficiencies due
to auxiliary task supervision and complex loss balancing requirements. This
paper introduces HadaSmileNet, a novel feature fusion framework that directly
integrates transformer-based representations with physiologically grounded
D-Markers through parameter-free multiplicative interactions. Through
systematic evaluation of 15 fusion strategies, we demonstrate that Hadamard
multiplicative fusion achieves optimal performance by enabling direct feature
interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach
establishes new state-of-the-art results for deep learning methods across four
benchmark datasets: UvA-NEMO (88.7 percent, +0.8), MMI (99.7 percent), SPOS
(98.5 percent, +0.7), and BBC (100 percent, +5.0). Comprehensive computational
analysis reveals 26 percent parameter reduction and simplified training
compared to multi-task alternatives, while feature visualization demonstrates
enhanced discriminative power through direct domain knowledge integration. The
framework's efficiency and effectiveness make it particularly suitable for
practical deployment in multimedia data mining applications that require
real-time affective computing capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机和3D高斯泼溅的联合动态人体与静态场景重建框架，通过事件引导的损失函数解决快速运动下的运动模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频中重建动态人体和静态场景存在困难，特别是在快速运动时RGB帧会出现运动模糊。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率的优势，更适合动态人体重建。

Method: 使用统一的3D高斯集合，其中包含可学习的语义属性；只有被分类为人体的高斯会进行形变动画，场景高斯保持静态。提出事件引导损失函数，匹配连续渲染之间的模拟亮度变化与事件流。

Result: 在两个基准数据集ZJU-MoCap-Blur和MMHPSD-Blur上实现了最先进的人体-场景重建效果，在PSNR/SSIM指标上显著优于强基线，LPIPS降低，特别对高速运动主体效果明显。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部人体掩码，简化了单独高斯集的管理，通过事件引导有效解决了快速运动下的重建模糊问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans together with static scenes from monocular
videos remains difficult, especially under fast motion, where RGB frames suffer
from motion blur. Event cameras exhibit distinct advantages, e.g., microsecond
temporal resolution, making them a superior sensing choice for dynamic human
reconstruction. Accordingly, we present a novel event-guided human-scene
reconstruction framework that jointly models human and scene from a single
monocular event camera via 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, a unified set
of 3D Gaussians carries a learnable semantic attribute; only Gaussians
classified as human undergo deformation for animation, while scene Gaussians
stay static. To combat blur, we propose an event-guided loss that matches
simulated brightness changes between consecutive renderings with the event
stream, improving local fidelity in fast-moving regions. Our approach removes
the need for external human masks and simplifies managing separate Gaussian
sets. On two benchmark datasets, ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur, it delivers
state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction, with notable gains over strong
baselines in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Live-E2T是一个实时威胁监控框架，通过结构化语义元组、在线事件去重和基于LLM的推理机制，同时实现高性能威胁检测和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时满足实时性能和决策可解释性的要求，需要一种能够统一这两个目标的解决方案。

Method: 1. 将视频帧解构为结构化的人-物-交互-地点语义元组；2. 提出高效的在线事件去重和更新机制；3. 使用思维链策略微调大语言模型进行透明推理。

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime等基准数据集上的实验表明，Live-E2T在威胁检测准确性、实时效率和可解释性方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: Live-E2T成功解决了实时威胁监控中性能与可解释性之间的权衡问题，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams
and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory
text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning
or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding
requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two
objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video
frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This
approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing
the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second,
an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to
filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time
responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a
Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and
logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment
reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and
UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the
crucial dimension of explainability.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在美学视觉理解方面存在显著差距，无法像专业摄影师那样从美学角度（如色彩、光影、构图）分析图像，而仅限于基本的物体识别和一般美学常识。

Method: 1）构建大规模专业摄影数据集PhotoCritique；2）提出PhotoEye模型，采用语言引导的多视角视觉融合机制；3）建立全面专业的美学评估基准PhotoBench。

Conclusion: 通过专业数据集、创新模型和评估基准的结合，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的美学视觉理解能力，为真实场景中的专业图像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult
to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator,
Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and
aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the
factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object
identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color
block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection,
localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual
understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they
are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they
frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive
expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing
knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To
fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce
a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among
professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large
scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from
PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a
languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image
aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark,
PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual
understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates
clear advantages over existing models.

Method: 利用XMem模型（记忆增强架构）来分割长序列cine-MRI中的肿瘤，通过高效集成记忆机制实现实时肿瘤运动跟踪。

Result: 由于实验记录丢失，无法报告精确的定量结果，但初步印象显示XMem框架表现出合理的分割性能并满足临床实时要求。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于改善MRI引导放疗中的肿瘤跟踪精度，为癌症治疗的安全性和准确性做出贡献。

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced tumor segmentation framework for real-time
MRI-guided radiotherapy, designed for the TrackRAD2025 challenge. Our method
leverages the XMem model, a memory-augmented architecture, to segment tumors
across long cine-MRI sequences. The proposed system efficiently integrates
memory mechanisms to track tumor motion in real-time, achieving high
segmentation accuracy even under challenging conditions with limited annotated
data. Unfortunately, the detailed experimental records have been lost,
preventing us from reporting precise quantitative results at this stage.
Nevertheless, From our preliminary impressions during development, the
XMem-based framework demonstrated reasonable segmentation performance and
satisfied the clinical real-time requirement. Our work contributes to improving
the precision of tumor tracking during MRI-guided radiotherapy, which is
crucial for enhancing the accuracy and safety of cancer treatments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSCM模型解决多对比度MRI超分辨率问题，通过动态空间扭曲模块、语义感知令牌聚合块和空间-频率融合块实现空间语义一致性，在减少参数的同时达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在建模空间语义一致性方面不足，且未充分利用频域信息，导致细粒度对齐差和高频细节恢复不足。

Method: SSCM模型包含三个核心组件：动态空间扭曲模块用于跨对比度空间对齐，语义感知令牌聚合块确保长程语义一致性，空间-频率融合块用于精细结构恢复。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，SSCM在参数更少的情况下实现了最先进的性能，确保了空间和语义一致的重建。

Conclusion: SSCM模型有效解决了多对比度MRI超分辨率中的空间语义一致性问题，在保持解剖结构对齐和相干性的同时提高了成像效率。

Abstract: Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) aims
to enhance low-resolution (LR) contrasts leveraging high-resolution (HR)
references, shortening acquisition time and improving imaging efficiency while
preserving anatomical details. The main challenge lies in maintaining
spatial-semantic consistency, ensuring anatomical structures remain
well-aligned and coherent despite structural discrepancies and motion between
the target and reference images. Conventional methods insufficiently model
spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, which
leads to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency
details. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model
(SSCM), which integrates a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast
spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range
semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure
restoration. Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and
semantically consistent reconstructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有放射学报告生成方法数据量大、计算资源需求高的问题，在预算受限条件下实现高效训练

Method: 使用Oracle-educated GRPO (OraPO)方法进行单阶段强化学习训练，结合FactScore-based奖励机制提取临床事实并检查与真实标签的一致性

Result: 在CheXpert Plus数据集上达到0.341 F1分数的新SOTA性能，训练数据减少2-3个数量级，使用小型基础视觉语言模型在普通硬件上实现

Conclusion: OraPO和FactS构成了一个紧凑而强大的框架，显著提高了临床挑战性病例的学习效率，为资源受限环境下的放射学报告生成提供了可行方案

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce clinically
faithful reports from chest X-ray images. Prevailing work typically follows a
scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and
oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In
this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based
reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables
single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare
or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight
oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic
clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding
dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a
compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency
on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the
CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training
data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

TL;DR: AMSF是一个基于参考的训练自由框架，能够在扩散模型中实现多参考风格的可控融合，解决了现有方法只能处理单一风格图像和缺乏平衡多种风格影响的机制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参考的方法存在两个主要限制：(a)只能接受一个风格图像，无法实现混合美学和扩展到更多风格；(b)缺乏平衡多种风格影响的机制。AMSF旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: AMSF通过语义标记分解模块编码所有风格图像和文本提示，并将其自适应注入到冻结扩散模型的每个交叉注意力层中。相似性感知重加权模块在每个去噪步骤重新校准分配给每个风格组件的注意力。

Result: 定性和定量评估显示，AMSF产生的多风格融合结果始终优于最先进方法，且其融合设计可无缝扩展到两个或更多风格。

Conclusion: AMSF代表了扩散模型中表达性多风格生成的实际进展。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based
training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference
styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are
limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid
aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled
mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these
challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token
decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention
layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then
recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style
component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any
fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations
show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to
two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward
expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

TL;DR: MLF-4DRCNet是一个用于3D目标检测的新型两阶段框架，通过4D雷达和相机图像的多级融合来解决现有方法中雷达点云稀疏性和噪声问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D毫米波雷达虽然成本效益高且鲁棒性强，但其点云存在显著稀疏性和噪声，限制了在3D目标检测中的独立应用。现有雷达-相机融合方法大多采用为LiDAR-相机融合设计的显式鸟瞰图融合范式，忽略了雷达的固有缺陷。

Method: 提出MLF-4DRCNet框架，包含三个关键模块：增强雷达点编码器（ERPE）模块、分层场景融合池化（HSFP）模块和提议级融合增强（PLFE）模块，实现点级、场景级和提议级的多模态信息融合。

Result: 在View-of-Delft（VoD）和TJ4DRadSet数据集上的实验结果表明，MLF-4DRCNet达到了最先进的性能，在VoD数据集上获得了与基于LiDAR的模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多级融合框架有效解决了4D雷达点云稀疏性和噪声问题，为自动驾驶中的低成本感知系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar, measuring the range, azimuth,
elevation, and Doppler velocity of objects, is recognized for its
cost-effectiveness and robustness in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, its
point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone
application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have
provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt
explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera
fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the
sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to
coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose
MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via
multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the
point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling
comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components:
the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion
Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module.
Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image
instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel
Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D
image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts
pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image
features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP.
Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets
demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD
dataset.

TL;DR: PDLS是一种基于Rectified Flow模型的训练免费框架，通过双流潜在空间引导解决扩散模型图像反演中的语义漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法将图像编码为单个潜在向量时，难以平衡结构保真度和语义准确性，导致重建图像出现语义漂移（如细节模糊或属性错误）。

Method: PDLS将反演过程分解为结构路径和语义路径，通过最优控制问题建模，使用线性二次调节器（LQR）获得闭式解，动态引导生成轨迹。

Result: 在FFHQ-1K和ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，PDLS在各种反演任务（高斯去模糊、运动去模糊、超分辨率和自由形式修复）中比单潜在基线方法产生更忠实于原始图像且语义对齐更好的重建结果。

Conclusion: PDLS通过双流潜在引导有效解决了扩散模型图像反演中的语义漂移问题，无需昂贵的逐图像优化即可保持精细细节。

Abstract: Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is
challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent
vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading
to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect
attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering
(PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for
their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two
complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a
semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal
control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory
at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine
detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K
and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring,
motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that
PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image
and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球MRI需求增长给医疗系统带来压力，尤其影响低资源和农村地区患者，需要AI解决方案来改善神经影像诊断效率和公平性。

Method: 使用大型学术医疗系统作为数据引擎，开发基于分层视觉架构的视觉语言模型，训练超过22万例MRI研究，并在包含3万例MRI研究的1年系统范围内测试。

Result: 在主要神经系统疾病（肿瘤、炎症、感染、发育病变等）的52种放射学诊断中，Prima平均ROC曲线下面积达92.0%，优于现有最先进的通用和医疗AI模型。

Conclusion: Prima展示了健康系统规模视觉语言模型的变革潜力，能够帮助缓解医疗系统偏见，推进AI驱动的医疗保健发展。

Abstract: Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological
diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has
risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging
turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout \cite{Chen2017-bt,
Rula2024-qp-1}. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in
low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health
system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM)
serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical
MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a
hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI
features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included
30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic
disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental
lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0,
outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima
offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists,
and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and
MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups
and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times
for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven
healthcare.

Conclusion: UiG框架通过理解与生成的深度融合，显著提升了文本到图像生成的性能

Abstract: Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for
text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these
reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which
limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the
deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel
reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG),
which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to
reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is
to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities
during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative
abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse
understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated
image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing
instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step,
gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG
framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image
generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on
the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark. The project code:

Abstract: Monocular relative and metric depth estimation has seen a tremendous boost in
the last few years due to the sharp advancements in foundation models and in
particular transformer based networks. As we start to see applications to the
domain of endoscopic images, there is still a lack of robust benchmarks and
high-quality datasets in that area. This paper addresses these limitations by
presenting a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art (metric and relative)
depth estimation models evaluated on real, unseen endoscopic images, providing
critical insights into their generalisation and performance in clinical
scenarios. Additionally, we introduce and publish a novel synthetic dataset
(EndoSynth) of endoscopic surgical instruments paired with ground truth metric
depth and segmentation masks, designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and
real-world data. We demonstrate that fine-tuning depth foundation models using
our synthetic dataset boosts accuracy on most unseen real data by a significant
margin. By providing both a benchmark and a synthetic dataset, this work
advances the field of depth estimation for endoscopic images and serves as an
important resource for future research. Project page, EndoSynth dataset and
trained weights are available at https://github.com/TouchSurgery/EndoSynth.

TL;DR: 提出LEAF-Mamba模型，通过局部强调状态空间模块和自适应融合模块，在RGB-D显著目标检测任务中实现性能与效率的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D显著目标检测方法在CNN的局部感受野限制和Vision Transformer的二次复杂度之间难以平衡，需要一种既能建模长距离依赖又保持计算效率的方法

Method: 提出LEAF-Mamba模型，包含局部强调状态空间模块(LE-SSM)捕获多尺度局部依赖，以及基于SSM的自适应融合模块(AFM)实现跨模态互补交互和可靠集成

Result: 在16个最先进的RGB-D SOD方法中取得最优性能，同时在RGB-T SOD任务上也表现出色，证明强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: LEAF-Mamba模型通过状态空间模型有效解决了RGB-D显著目标检测中的局部语义缺失和跨模态融合不足问题，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法

Abstract: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous
objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods
mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision
Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a
challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently,
state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling
long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to
RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate
cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and
Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel
components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture
multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive
fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable
cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in
both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent
performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级食品图像分类算法，结合窗口多头注意力机制和空间注意力机制，在降低计算成本的同时保持高分类准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品行业对生产质量和效率要求不断提高，但Vision Transformer模型参数多、计算复杂度高，难以在资源受限环境中部署

Method: 集成窗口多头注意力机制（WMHAM）和空间注意力机制（SAM），WMHAM通过窗口划分降低计算成本，SAM自适应强调关键空间区域

Result: 在Food-101和Vireo Food-172数据集上分别达到95.24%和94.33%的准确率，同时显著减少参数和FLOPs

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和分类性能之间实现了有效平衡，适合在资源受限环境中部署

Abstract: With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and
technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality
and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling
automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety
supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this
task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high
computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues,
we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a
Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism
(SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global
contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM
adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature
representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%,
respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with
baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an
effective balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感中的开放集土地覆盖分析需要实现细粒度空间定位和语义开放分类，不仅要检测和分割无类别监督的新对象，还要通过多模态推理为其分配可解释的语义标签。

Method: 三阶段流程：(1)使用可提示的微调分割模型(SAM)进行精确发现和掩码提取；(2)通过两阶段微调的多模态大语言模型(MLLM)进行语义归因和上下文描述；(3)使用LLM作为评判者并手动评分MLLM评估。

Conclusion: OSDA在自动化制图更新和大规模地球观测分析方面显示出强大潜力，为开放世界遥感解释提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to
achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization.
This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without
categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels
through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated
three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery,
segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery
and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2)
semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned
multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring
of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level
semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote
sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free,
the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery
without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and
interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong
potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动植物识别主要依赖北美和西欧的野外照片数据，而生物多样性最丰富的热带地区数据匮乏。但植物标本馆收藏了大量热带地区的标本数据，可以弥补这一不足。

Method: 采用跨域分类任务，训练集包含数十万份植物标本馆标本和数千张野外照片，并包含5种形态和功能性状数据。测试集仅包含野外照片。

Result: 挑战赛基于约1000种圭亚那地盾地区植物进行评估，该地区是全球植物多样性最高的地区之一。

Conclusion: 植物标本馆数据可以作为补充资源，帮助改进数据贫乏热带地区的植物自动识别系统。

Abstract: Automated plant identification has improved considerably thanks to recent
advances in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and
more field photos. However, this profusion of data concerns only a few tens of
thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe, much
less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical
countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have
systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria,
especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity
informatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised
records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF
2021") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of
flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It
is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana
Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant
diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain
classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred
thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a
correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata
(location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values
of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species. The test set
consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This article presents the
resources and evaluations of the assessment carried out, summarises the
approaches and systems used by the participating research groups and provides
an analysis of the main results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AGSwap的新方法，用于解决文本到图像生成中跨类别对象融合的问题，并引入了COF数据集作为基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨类别对象融合时往往产生有偏差、视觉混乱或语义不一致的结果，且缺乏全面的基准数据集。

Method: AGSwap方法包含两个关键组件：组间嵌入交换（通过特征操作融合不同概念的语义属性）和自适应组更新（基于平衡评估分数的动态优化机制）。

Result: 大量实验表明，AGSwap在简单和复杂提示下均优于现有的最先进组合T2I方法，包括GPT-Image-1。

Conclusion: AGSwap是一种简单而高效的跨类别对象融合方法，配合新构建的COF数据集，显著提升了文本到图像生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained
increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad
applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However,
existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically
inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration.
Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a
comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose
\textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective
approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping,
which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature
manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism
guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis.
Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a
large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and
WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling
451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap
outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1
using simple and complex prompts.

Conclusion: RSVG-ZeroOV提供了一个高效且可扩展的解决方案，展示了冻结通用基础模型在零样本开放词汇遥感视觉定位中的巨大潜力

Abstract: Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote
sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing
approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their
applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage
generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on
expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework
that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for
zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key
stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain
cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use
self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as
cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that
capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii)
Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model
(DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are
often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention
evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding
purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome
task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently
outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

TL;DR: 提出属性提示组合框架，通过文本语义增强ReID的区分性和泛化性，在单域和跨域ReID任务中均超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ReID模型局限于单域或跨域场景，单域模型容易过拟合域特定特征，跨域模型的归一化策略可能抑制身份特定判别线索

Method: 设计属性提示生成器（包含语义属性字典和提示组合模块），提出快慢训练策略平衡ReID特定区分性和通用表示学习

Result: 在传统和域泛化ReID数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架在区分性和泛化性方面均优于最先进方法

Conclusion: APC框架通过利用文本语义有效解决了ReID中的过拟合和泛化问题，展现了优越的性能

Abstract: Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across
non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable
progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or
cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain
models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models
often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress
identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose
an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual
semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically,
we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic
Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an
over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while
PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative
attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization
ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training
Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable
representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS)
to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update
Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the
pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively
focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive
experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets
demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting
superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization. The
source code is available at https://github.com/AWangYQ/APC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出OTCCLIP框架，使用最优传输理论重构图像-文本对，以防御CLIP模型的数据投毒和后门攻击。该方法通过细粒度特征对齐和最优传输距离度量，显著降低了攻击成功率并提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法仅依赖图像和文本的全局表示来匹配新标题，忽略了细粒度特征，可能导致错误配对并损害CLIP预训练效果。需要更精细的特征对齐方法来有效防御投毒攻击。

Method: 提出基于最优传输的框架OTCCLIP：1）设计基于最优传输的细粒度视觉-文本特征集距离度量；2）根据最优传输距离重新分配标题；3）使用最优传输目标函数促进模态间和模态内的细粒度对齐。

Result: 实验表明OTCCLIP能成功降低投毒攻击的成功率，相比之前方法显著提升了CLIP在投毒数据集上的零样本和线性探测性能。

Conclusion: OTCCLIP通过最优传输理论实现了更精细的图像-文本特征对齐，有效防御了CLIP模型的投毒攻击，同时提升了模型在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to
massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous
defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption
for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global
representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of
visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and
harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal
Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We
propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained
visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the
proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the
negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality
fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective
functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease
the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous
methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing
performance trained on poisoned datasets.

TL;DR: 提出LFI框架，通过建模视觉理解作为交互过程来解决视觉基础模型从视觉语言模型知识迁移的局限性，实现更有效的跨模态知识转移


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型主要采用结果导向范式，忽视了视觉语言模型中编码的交互过程，这种表示差异阻碍了有效的知识迁移和跨视觉任务的泛化能力

Method: LFI框架包含两个技术创新：交互查询（维护跨网络层的持久关系结构）和基于交互的监督（源自视觉语言模型的跨模态注意力机制）

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现一致改进，TinyImageNet分类提升3.3mAP，COCO检测/分割提升1.6mAP/2.4AP，在跨域设置中表现优异，PACS和VLCS零样本分别提升2.4和9.3

Conclusion: LFI框架通过显式建模交互过程实现了更忠实和高效的知识迁移，在认知对齐方面优于结果导向方法2.7倍，具有最小参数开销和更快收敛速度

Abstract: Current visual foundation models (VFMs) face a fundamental limitation in
transferring knowledge from vision language models (VLMs), while VLMs excel at
modeling cross-modal interactions through unified representation spaces,
existing VFMs predominantly adopt result-oriented paradigms that neglect the
underlying interaction processes. This representational discrepancy hinders
effective knowledge transfer and limits generalization across diverse vision
tasks. We propose Learning from Interactions (LFI), a cognitive-inspired
framework that addresses this gap by explicitly modeling visual understanding
as an interactive process. Our key insight is that capturing the dynamic
interaction patterns encoded in pre-trained VLMs enables more faithful and
efficient knowledge transfer to VFMs. The approach centers on two technical
innovations, Interaction Queries, which maintain persistent relational
structures across network layers, and interaction-based supervision, derived
from the cross-modal attention mechanisms of VLMs. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving 3.3
and 1.6mAP/2.4AP absolute gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO
detection/segmentation respectively, with minimal parameter overhead and faster
convergence. The framework particularly excels in cross-domain settings,
delivering 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Human
evaluations further confirm its cognitive alignment, outperforming
result-oriented methods by 2.7 times in semantic consistency metrics.

Conclusion: HyPSAM展示了提示工程在RGB-T SOD领域的潜力，为多模态显著目标检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent
objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal
modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects
remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the
extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the
zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for
RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that
generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs
dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive
cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter
kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose
a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general
optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid
prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and
box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating
with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains,
thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The

TL;DR: TriFusion-AE是一种多模态交叉注意力自编码器，通过整合文本先验、多视图图像的单目深度图和LiDAR点云来提高鲁棒性，在强对抗攻击和重噪声条件下显著优于传统CNN自编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云在自动驾驶和机器人感知中至关重要，但原始点云容易受到噪声、遮挡和对抗性破坏的影响。传统自编码器在真实世界挑战性条件下性能下降。

Method: 提出TriFusion-AE多模态交叉注意力自编码器，通过文本语义线索、图像几何特征和LiDAR空间结构的对齐，学习对随机噪声和对抗扰动具有鲁棒性的表示。

Result: 在nuScenes-mini数据集上评估，模型在强对抗攻击和重噪声条件下表现出显著更鲁棒的重建能力，而基于CNN的自编码器在这些条件下崩溃。

Conclusion: 多模态融合框架是模型无关的，可以与任何基于CNN的点云自编码器无缝集成进行联合表示学习，在低数据部署场景中表现出色。

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception is central to autonomous driving and robotics, yet raw
point clouds remain highly vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial
corruptions. Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and
reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world
conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention
autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from
multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning
semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial
structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to
stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing
limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more
robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where
CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to
reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion
framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with
any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.

models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage
capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the
instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however,
assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to
real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming
in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL
Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a
successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past
learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as
a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected
based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the
codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a
video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive
experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific
VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
proposed COLT.

Conclusion: FixingGS通过充分利用扩散模型能力，有效解决了稀疏视角3DGS重建中的伪影和一致性难题

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes
from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual
information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D
representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to
generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in
under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle
to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and
implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method
that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for
sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our
distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent
diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting.
In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further
refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with
superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be
released publicly.

*Xijun Wang,Junyun Huang,Rayyan Abdalla,Chengyuan Zhang,Ruiqi Xian,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-VLM提出了一种基于高斯分位数的非均匀权重分离方法，通过将模型权重分为异常值（显著）和多个正常值（不显著）子集，实现超低比特（≤2位）量化，显著提升视觉语言模型在硬件受限环境中的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的计算需求和内存要求较高，限制了其在硬件受限环境中的应用。现有方法在超低比特量化（≤2位）方面存在效率与精度之间的关键差距。

Method: 提出Bi-VLM方法：1）基于高斯分位数非均匀分离模型权重；2）提出显著性感知混合量化算法，根据显著性度量和压缩目标对缩放器和二进制矩阵施加不同约束；3）在量化模型上执行token剪枝，利用图像token的冗余性进一步优化效率。

Result: 在语言模型部分，Bi-VLM在视觉问答任务上比SOTA方法提升3%-47%（基于四个基准测试和三个模型）；在整个VLM上，比SOTA提升4%-45%。量化模型中的图像token冗余度达到90%-99%，可通过剪枝进一步提升效率。

Conclusion: Bi-VLM通过创新的非均匀权重分离和显著性感知量化方法，成功实现了超低比特量化，在保持精度的同时显著提升了视觉语言模型的效率，为硬件受限环境下的应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: We address the critical gap between the computational demands of
vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision
(bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated
by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which
restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose
Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian
quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and
multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a
proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We
propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize
weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices
based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our
approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM
outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms
of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM,
our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the
quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99%
in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to
improve efficiency.

TL;DR: DiSSECT是一个自监督学习框架，通过多尺度向量量化在医学图像中创建离散表示瓶颈，抑制捷径学习，提高特征的可迁移性和标签效率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在医学图像中存在架构复杂、依赖解剖学先验、易受捷径学习影响的问题，特别是在胸部X光等解剖相似度高、病理特征细微的模态中。

Method: 将多尺度向量量化整合到自监督学习流程中，通过离散表示瓶颈约束模型学习可重复、结构感知的特征，同时抑制视图特定或低效用模式。

Result: DiSSECT在分类和分割任务上表现优异，需要极少或无需微调，在低标签场景下具有高标签效率，在多个公共医学影像数据集上验证了其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: DiSSECT框架通过离散表示学习有效解决了医学图像自监督学习中的捷径学习问题，提高了特征的可迁移性和临床适用性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for medical
image representation learning, particularly in settings with limited labeled
data. However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures,
anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their
scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to
shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical
similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT
-- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable
Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization
into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This
constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while
suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation
transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both
classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and
shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate
DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its
robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: 美国每年发生约210万起鹿车碰撞事故，造成440人死亡、5.9万人受伤和100亿美元经济损失，同时导致鹿群数量下降，亟需有效的预防技术。

Method: 使用热成像技术和深度学习模型，在收集的12,000多张热成像鹿图像数据集上进行训练验证，并通过CV2X通信设备实现车辆间数据共享。

Result: 系统表现优异：平均精度98.84%，精确率95.44%，召回率95.96%；热成像在恶劣天气下保持88-92%检测准确率，而传统摄像头低于60%；端到端延迟低于100毫秒。

Conclusion: 该系统通过热成像和车联网技术为减少鹿车碰撞提供了可行的技术路径，现场测试验证了其在不同天气条件下的鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United
States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in
approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic
damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer
populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning
system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and
vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions.
Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal
deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation
demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision,
95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested
during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the
driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across
diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92
percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible
light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high
probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to
surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything
(CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency
consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This
research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle
collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

Motivation: 手术标注数据稀缺限制了深度学习系统在计算机辅助干预中的发展，现有扩散模型存在数据记忆化问题，导致生成的样本不一致且缺乏多样性，可能损害下游性能

Method: 构建偏好和非偏好合成图像对，通过轻量级微调扩散模型，使图像生成过程与下游目标明确对齐

Conclusion: SAADi方法克服了样本退化问题，确立了任务感知对齐作为缓解数据稀缺和推进手术视觉应用的关键原则

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for
developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While
diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data
memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to
improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical
Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion
models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs
of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs
lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation
process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical
datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and
$2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed
for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further
boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method
overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key
principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法可有效实现动态PET的高时空分辨率，代码已开源

Abstract: Achieving high image quality for temporal frames in dynamic positron emission
tomography (PET) is challenging due to the limited statistic especially for the
short frames. Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) is useful in a
wide range of medical image denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a
model-based neural network for dynamic PET image denoising. The inter-frame
spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are
used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model.
We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural
networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end
neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data
demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for
dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may
be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic
PET. Our source code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的光流标签插值与多任务学习框架有效解决了手术场景标注的时空不平衡问题，为机器人辅助手术的视觉理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern
surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through
minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a
precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures
is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task
approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and
diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding.
Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires
sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to
the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term
annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas
short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action
detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant
temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation
with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is
used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse
spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for
training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of
surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for
their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse
content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved
multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and
autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address
this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to
simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our
approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for
next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion
denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over
a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting
lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a
22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of
the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that
enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining
advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model
achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex
multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

Method: 使用三个支持Iconclass的数据集（ArtDL、ICONCLASS、Wikidata），在三种条件下测试模型：仅使用类别标签、使用Iconclass描述、以及五样本少样本学习，并与ResNet50基线进行比较。

Result: Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-4o超越了ResNet50基线，但在Wikidata数据集上准确率显著下降。使用类别描述通常能提高零样本性能，而少样本学习效果较差。

Abstract: This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the task of single-label
classification of Christian Iconography. The goal was to assess whether
general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5,
can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers,
and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis:
(RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian
saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with
contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study
using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and
Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were
tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2)
classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five
exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the
same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed
the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset,
where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity
to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions
generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced
lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We
conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in
visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the
application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows,
suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the
study to other classification strategies and models.

Conclusion: LRGC提供了一种可学习的超参数无关图构建方法，通过可训练阈值参数自适应调整图结构，显著提升了ViG模型的性能。

Abstract: Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision.
Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural
Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers.
Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of
images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image
representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer
that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a
hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on
non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the
latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best
neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph
Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack
the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction
method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized
Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies
key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold
reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable
mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the
neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding
methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows
tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds
are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the
model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具增强大语言模型的训练方法存在局限性，自我反思依赖启发式提示或单向推理，在多轮交互中容易重复错误，缺乏系统性的错误诊断和修复能力。

Method: 结合DAPO和GSPO目标，采用针对工具使用优化的奖励方案，训练模型执行Reflect-Then-Call-Then-Final的逐步策略，生成精确的反思诊断和可执行的后续调用。

Result: 在BFCL v3和Tool-Reflection-Bench基准测试中，多轮工具调用成功率和错误恢复能力显著提升，冗余调用减少。

Conclusion: 将反思过程显式化并直接优化，能够提高工具交互的可靠性，为智能体提供从失败中学习的可复现路径。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with
supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes
single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts
or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning
error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a
failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured
reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,
controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise
reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and
then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine
DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing
the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce
Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks
structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result
consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,
reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.
Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn
tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These
results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly
improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for
agents to learn from failure.

Conclusion: Point Prompt Defender为基于提示的分割提供了有效的自动化优化方案，显著提升了SAM的性能

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), yet existing approaches often rely on heuristic or
manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization. In this
paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning
framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize
point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by
representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode
both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker
agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's
segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these
disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep
Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During
inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt
sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks
without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender
effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a
flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based
segmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to propel the
advancement of general-purpose, large-scale 3D vision models for remote sensing
imagery. While several datasets have been proposed within the realm of remote
sensing, many existing collections either lack comprehensive depth information
or fail to establish precise alignment between depth data and remote sensing
images. To address this deficiency, we present a visual Benchmark for 3D
understanding of Remotely Sensed images, dubbed RS3DBench. This dataset
encompasses 54,951 pairs of remote sensing images and pixel-level aligned depth
maps, accompanied by corresponding textual descriptions, spanning a broad array
of geographical contexts. It serves as a tool for training and assessing 3D
visual perception models within remote sensing image spatial understanding
tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a remotely sensed depth estimation model
derived from stable diffusion, harnessing its multimodal fusion capabilities,
thereby delivering state-of-the-art performance on our dataset. Our endeavor
seeks to make a profound contribution to the evolution of 3D visual perception
models and the advancement of geographic artificial intelligence within the
remote sensing domain. The dataset, models and code will be accessed on the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSplat：首个无需SfM的基于事件相机的去模糊3D高斯泼溅方法，通过直接获取初始点云和引入事件流实现高效去模糊重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统SfM方法在运动模糊场景中因相机位姿估计误差累积导致重建质量下降的问题，以及利用事件相机对动态变化的高敏感性来提升去模糊效果

Method: 1）利用预训练的密集立体模块（DUSt3R）直接从模糊图像获取准确初始点云，避免相机位姿估计的中间步骤；2）引入事件流到去模糊流程中，通过解码事件流和模糊图像的潜在清晰图像来提供细粒度监督信号

Result: 在多种场景下的广泛实验表明，DeblurSplat不仅能生成高保真度的新视角图像，而且在渲染效率上显著优于当前最先进的去模糊3D-GS方法

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需SfM的高效去模糊3D重建，证明了事件相机在运动模糊场景重建中的重要作用

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-free
deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting method via event camera, dubbed DeblurSplat.
We address the motion-deblurring problem in two ways. First, we leverage the
pretrained capability of the dense stereo module (DUSt3R) to directly obtain
accurate initial point clouds from blurred images. Without calculating camera
poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from
inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we
introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to
dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and
blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene
reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes
demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel
views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs
in deblur 3D-GS.

Motivation: 莫尔条纹是由显示像素阵列和相机传感器网格之间的频谱混叠产生的各向异性、多尺度伪影，对数字图像去莫尔处理构成重大挑战。

Method: MoiréNet包含两个关键组件：方向频率-空间编码器（DFSE）通过方向差分卷积识别莫尔条纹方向，以及频率-空间自适应选择器（FSAS）实现精确的特征自适应抑制。

Result: 在公开和实际使用数据集上的广泛实验表明，MoiréNet实现了最先进的性能，同时具有很高的参数效率。仅需5.513M参数，比ESDNet-L减少48%。

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns arise from spectral aliasing between display pixel lattices
and camera sensor grids, manifesting as anisotropic, multi-scale artifacts that
pose significant challenges for digital image demoir\'eing. We propose
Moir\'eNet, a convolutional neural U-Net-based framework that synergistically
integrates frequency and spatial domain features for effective artifact
removal. Moir\'eNet introduces two key components: a Directional
Frequency-Spatial Encoder (DFSE) that discerns moir\'e orientation via
directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector
(FSAS) that enables precise, feature-adaptive suppression. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Moir\'eNet achieves state-of-the-art performance
on public and actively used datasets while being highly parameter-efficient.
With only 5.513M parameters, representing a 48% reduction compared to ESDNet-L,
Moir\'eNet combines superior restoration quality with parameter efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained applications including
smartphone photography, industrial imaging, and augmented reality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的频率感知音频-视觉分割（FAVS）框架，通过频率域分解和重组来解决音频和视觉模态在高频信号上的固有矛盾，实现了更精确的多模态分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频-视觉分割方法忽视了音频和视觉模态在频率域上的固有矛盾——音频高频信号普遍存在干扰噪声，而视觉高频信号包含丰富的结构细节。忽略这些差异会导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出了FAVS框架，包含两个关键模块：频率域增强分解器（FDED）模块和协同跨模态一致性（SCMC）模块。FDED采用基于残差的迭代频率分解来区分模态特定的语义和结构特征，SCMC利用专家混合架构通过动态专家路由增强语义一致性和模态特定特征保留。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，FAVS框架实现了最先进的性能，丰富的定性可视化进一步验证了所提出模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将AVS任务重新定义为频率域分解和重组问题，提出的FAVS框架有效解决了模态间频率域矛盾，显著提升了音频-视觉分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) plays a critical role in multimodal machine
learning by effectively integrating audio and visual cues to precisely segment
objects or regions within visual scenes. Recent AVS methods have demonstrated
significant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain
contradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering
noise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in
visual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper
perspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and
recomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware
Audio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules:
Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal
Consistency (SCMC) module. FDED module employs a residual-based iterative
frequency decomposition to discriminate modality-specific semantics and
structural features, and SCMC module leverages a mixture-of-experts
architecture to reinforce semantic consistency and modality-specific feature
preservation through dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our FAVS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
benchmark datasets, and abundant qualitative visualizations further verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FDED and SCMC modules. The code will be released
as open source upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Deep learning has become the de facto standard and dominant paradigm in image

often results in "black-box" models, whose decision-making processes are
difficult to interpret, raising concerns about reliability in critical
applications. To address this challenge and provide human a method to

emerged. This paper surveys four representative approaches in xAI for visual

(iii) Prototype-based methods, and (iv) Hybrid approaches. We analyze their
underlying mechanisms, strengths and limitations, as well as evaluation
metrics, thereby providing a comprehensive overview to guide future research

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖LiDAR进行环境感知，但真实LiDAR数据收集耗时且易受噪声和稀疏性影响。需要生成高质量合成数据来提升感知性能。

Method: 使用改进的DDPM模型，包含新颖的噪声调度和时间步嵌入技术，能够生成更真实的点云数据。在IAMCV和KITTI-360数据集上进行评估。

Conclusion: 提出的改进DDPM方法在LiDAR数据生成方面表现出色，为自动驾驶感知系统提供了有效的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by
improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that
effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs
use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides
high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation,
and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is
time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather
or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding
techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby
improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in
AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's
temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on
the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various
configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance
metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results
demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and
its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data,
producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural
detail.

TL;DR: AGSSP是一种新颖的金属表面缺陷检测预训练范式，通过异常先验指导表示学习，解决了传统预训练方法在工业数据上的领域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法面临两个关键问题：在自然图像数据集上预训练存在领域差距，而在工业数据上自监督预训练又难以区分细微缺陷与复杂背景噪声。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先通过从异常图中蒸馏知识来预训练模型主干，捕获缺陷显著特征；然后使用从异常图导出的伪缺陷框来预训练检测器，使其与定位任务对齐。

Result: 实验表明AGSSP在各种设置下都能持续提升性能，相比基于ImageNet的模型，mAP@0.5提升高达10%，mAP@0.5:0.95提升11.4%。

Conclusion: AGSSP通过异常引导的自监督预训练有效解决了工业缺陷检测中的预训练困境，为金属表面缺陷检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface
defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However,
its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image
datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive
self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective
due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle
defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we
introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm
that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP
employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by
distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture
defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect
boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable
this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly
maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images.
Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface
defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP
consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a
10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to
ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly
available at https://clovermini.github.io/AGSSP-Dev/.

Motivation: 现有方法主要将音频特征映射到几何变形，忽略了音频相关的外观变化。需要一种能够同时处理几何和外观变化的通用音频驱动头像合成方法。

Method: 使用跨身份多视角视频训练UHAP，通过中性扫描数据进行监督学习。构建通用语音模型将原始音频输入映射到UHAP潜在表情空间，该空间编码了几何和外观变化。采用单目编码器进行个性化微调。

Result: 方法能够生成高度逼真的头像，具有精确的唇部同步和细腻的表情细节（如眉毛运动、视线转移、真实口腔外观和运动）。在唇部同步准确性、图像质量和感知真实感方面优于现有几何方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个能够进行详细外观建模和渲染的通用音频驱动头像模型，在多个评估指标上均优于竞争对手。

Abstract: We introduce the first method for audio-driven universal photorealistic
avatar synthesis, combining a person-agnostic speech model with our novel
Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP). UHAP is trained on cross-identity
multi-view videos. In particular, our UHAP is supervised with neutral scan
data, enabling it to capture the identity-specific details at high fidelity. In
contrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to
geometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance
variations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the
UHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both,
geometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new
subjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression
of dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these
expression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage
to focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry.
Decoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly
realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive
details, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior
appearance as well as motion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
is not only the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that can account
for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, but it also outperforms
competing (geometry-only) methods across metrics measuring lip-sync accuracy,
quantitative image quality, and perceptual realism.

Abstract: Dendritic spines are key structural components of excitatory synapses in the
brain. Given the size of dendritic spines provides a proxy for synaptic
efficacy, their detection and tracking across time is important for studies of
the neural basis of learning and memory. Despite their relevance, large-scale
analyses of the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy
data remain challenging and labor-intense. Here, we present a modular machine
learning-based pipeline designed to automate the detection, time-tracking, and
feature extraction of dendritic spines in volumes chronically recorded with
two-photon microscopy. Our approach tackles the challenges posed by biological
data by combining a transformer-based detection module, a depth-tracking
component that integrates spatial features, a time-tracking module to associate
3D spines across time by leveraging spatial consistency, and a feature
extraction unit that quantifies biologically relevant spine properties. We
validate our method on open-source labeled spine data, and on two complementary
annotated datasets that we publish alongside this work: one for detection and
depth-tracking, and one for time-tracking, which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first data of this kind. To encourage future research, we release our
data, code, and pre-trained weights at
https://github.com/pamelaosuna/SynapFlow, establishing a baseline for scalable,
end-to-end analysis of dendritic spine dynamics.

Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification
performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a
major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce.
Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual
models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper
proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM
and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the
set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a
confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier
directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies
high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual
representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier,
allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without
supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large
language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on
semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

Conclusion: 该方法为镜面丰富环境中的3D重建设定了新的基准，证明了利用镜面反射作为补充视角的有效性。

Abstract: Mirror-containing environments pose unique challenges for 3D reconstruction
and novel view synthesis (NVS), as reflective surfaces introduce view-dependent
distortions and inconsistencies. While cutting-edge methods such as Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical
scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing
solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but
often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These
reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details
and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction
in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset
featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror
masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in
reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of
3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary
viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and
recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that
ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and
training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich
environments.

Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in
gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard
for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the
advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the
laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a
significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury,
it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct.
This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach
for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired
during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of
an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed.
Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the
training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical
considerations.

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中表现出优于现有UDA、WDA和SAM方法的性能。

Conclusion: Prompt-DAS框架在域自适应分割任务中具有有效性和灵活性，能够适应不同的提示配置需求。

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) of numerous organelle instances from
large-scale electron microscopy (EM) is a promising way to enable
annotation-efficient learning. Inspired by SAM, we propose a promptable
multitask framework, namely Prompt-DAS, which is flexible enough to utilize any
number of point prompts during the adaptation training stage and testing stage.
Thus, with varying prompt configurations, Prompt-DAS can perform unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) and weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA), as well
as interactive segmentation during testing. Unlike the foundation model SAM,
which necessitates a prompt for each individual object instance, Prompt-DAS is
only trained on a small dataset and can utilize full points on all instances,
sparse points on partial instances, or even no points at all, facilitated by
the incorporation of an auxiliary center-point detection task. Moreover, a
novel prompt-guided contrastive learning is proposed to enhance discriminative
feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing UDA, WDA,
and SAM-based approaches.

Motivation: 当前视频理解基准主要关注室内场景或短距离户外活动，缺乏对长距离旅行中地理时空轨迹理解能力的评估，这对于下一代MLLMs的实际应用至关重要。

Method: 开发了包含200个旅行视频的VIR-Bench基准，将行程重建作为核心评估任务，并基于该基准开发了一个旅行规划代理原型。

Result: 实验表明，包括专有模型在内的最先进MLLMs在VIR-Bench上得分较低，验证了处理长时空尺度视频的挑战性。开发的旅行规划代理显示出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: VIR-Bench不仅能有效评估模型性能，其评估协议还能转化为实际应用中的具体性能提升，为下一代MLLMs的发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new
possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus
largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the
challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering
extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation
MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and
navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark
consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a
challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs'
geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high
scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended
spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in
which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights
gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations
verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but
also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

### [94] [Unveiling Chain of Step Reasoning for Vision-Language Models with Fine-grained Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19003)
*Honghao Chen,Xingzhou Lou,Xiaokun Feng,Kaiqi Huang,Xinlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于视觉语言模型的逐步推理框架（Chain of Step Reasoning），通过细粒度的推理步骤评估和强化学习，在视觉语言推理任务上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的思维链推理方法在视觉语言任务中通常采用粗粒度的推理链，难以进行细粒度结构化推理，且难以评估中间推理步骤的质量和奖励。

Method: 提出了一个简单有效的透明框架，包括步骤级推理数据、过程奖励模型（PRM）和强化学习训练，能够准确评估推理步骤质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为视觉语言模型提供了基准，并为更复杂的多模态推理提供了见解，相关数据集、模型和代码将开源。

Abstract: Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an
open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ
reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform
fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to
evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we
delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling
assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective
reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We
present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the
step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement
learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong
baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language
benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and
ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing
properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a
baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex
multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available at

*Ioannis Sarafis,Alexandros Papadopoulos,Anastasios Delopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SAM和ViT的弱监督食物图像语义分割方法，利用ViT的类激活图生成SAM提示，无需像素级标注即可实现食物分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决食物图像分割需要大量像素级标注的问题，利用弱监督学习和预训练模型的零样本能力来降低标注成本。

Method: 使用Swin Transformer生成类激活图作为SAM的提示，结合图像预处理技术和单/多掩码生成策略，仅需图像级标注进行训练。

Result: 在FoodSeg103数据集上测试，平均每张图像生成2.4个掩码（不含背景），多掩码场景下mIoU达到0.54。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为加速食物图像标注的工具，或集成到食物营养追踪应用中，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach
for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and
promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention
mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation
maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable
for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained
exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level
annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the
SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in
combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The
methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of
2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for
the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to
accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food
and nutrition tracking applications.

*Jierui Qu,Jianchun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyL-UNet是一种基于动态学习的超声心动图分割架构，通过构建回声动态图和心脏相位动态注意力机制，在保持分割精度的同时显著提升时间稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图易受变形和斑点噪声影响，导致帧间分割抖动，即使单帧分割精度高，时间不稳定性也会削弱功能估计和临床可解释性。

Method: 提出DyL-UNet架构，构建回声动态图提取视频动态信息，采用多个Swin-Transformer编码器-解码器分支处理单帧图像，在跳跃连接处引入心脏相位动态注意力机制强制时间一致性。

Result: 在CAMUS和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上的实验表明，DyL-UNet在保持与现有方法相当分割精度的同时，实现了更优的时间一致性。

Conclusion: DyL-UNet为自动化临床超声心动图提供了可靠的解决方案，能够实现时间稳定且精确的分割。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. Yet echocardiography is prone to
deformation and speckle noise, causing frame-to-frame segmentation jitter. Even
with high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can
weaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address
these issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal
consistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally
stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an
Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic
information from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based
encoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further
introduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections,
which uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce
temporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS
and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation
accuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal
consistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical
echocardiography.

TL;DR: ColorBlindnessEval是一个新颖的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在受色盲测试启发的视觉对抗场景中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在复杂视觉环境中的可靠性存在不足，特别是在对抗性视觉场景下容易产生幻觉问题，需要专门的评估工具来改进模型鲁棒性。

Method: 构建包含500张类似石原色盲测试图像的数据集，包含0-99数字的不同颜色组合，使用是/否和开放式提示评估9个VLMs，并与人类参与者进行性能对比。

Result: 实验显示模型在对抗性环境中识别数字的能力存在明显局限，普遍存在幻觉问题，表现不如人类参与者。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了提升VLMs在复杂视觉环境中鲁棒性的必要性，ColorBlindnessEval可作为评估和改进VLM可靠性的重要工具。

Abstract: This paper presents ColorBlindnessEval, a novel benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in visually
adversarial scenarios inspired by the Ishihara color blindness test. Our
dataset comprises 500 Ishihara-like images featuring numbers from 0 to 99 with
varying color combinations, challenging VLMs to accurately recognize numerical
information embedded in complex visual patterns. We assess 9 VLMs using Yes/No
and open-ended prompts and compare their performance with human participants.
Our experiments reveal limitations in the models' ability to interpret numbers
in adversarial contexts, highlighting prevalent hallucination issues. These
findings underscore the need to improve the robustness of VLMs in complex
visual environments. ColorBlindnessEval serves as a valuable tool for
benchmarking and improving the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications
where accuracy is critical.

*Hung Nguyen,Runfa Li,An Le,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveletGaussian是一个高效稀疏视图3D高斯重建框架，通过将扩散过程移至小波域，仅对低分辨率子带应用扩散，高频子带用轻量网络优化，显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在稀疏视图下的性能急剧下降，现有方法使用扩散模型修复渲染结果但计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出小波域扩散方法：低频子带用扩散模型处理，高频子带用轻量网络优化；采用在线随机掩码策略替代低效的留一法。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和OmniObject3D数据集上实验表明，WaveletGaussian在保持竞争性渲染质量的同时大幅减少训练时间。

Conclusion: WaveletGaussian通过小波域分解和高效训练策略，实现了稀疏视图3D高斯重建的质量与效率平衡。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for
image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in
sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing
diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo
ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur
heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present
WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object
reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain:
diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while
high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further
propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs
for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient,
leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360
and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality
while substantially reducing training time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sa2VA-i是对Sa2VA模型的改进版本，通过修正训练和推理过程中的不一致性问题，显著提升了在视频对象分割任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现Sa2VA模型在视频对象分割任务中未能发挥其全部潜力，主要原因是训练和推理过程存在不一致性。

Method: 提出Sa2VA-i模型，通过修正训练和推理过程中的不一致性问题来改进原Sa2VA模型。

Result: Sa2VA-i在多个视频基准测试中创下新纪录：MeViS提升+11.6 J&F，Ref-YT-VOS提升+1.4，Ref-DAVIS提升+3.3，ReVOS提升+4.1。Sa2VA-i-1B模型在MeViS基准上甚至能与原Sa2VA-26B模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了看似微不足道的实现细节的重要性，为视频分割领域提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Sa2VA is a recent model for language-guided dense grounding in images and
video that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple segmentation
benchmarks and that has become widely popular. However, we found that Sa2VA
does not perform according to its full potential for referring video object
segmentation tasks. We identify inconsistencies between training and inference
procedures as the key factor holding it back. To mitigate this issue, we
propose an improved version of Sa2VA, Sa2VA-i, that rectifies these issues and
improves the results. In fact, Sa2VA-i sets a new state of the art for multiple
video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on
Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA
checkpoints. With our fixes, the Sa2VA-i-1B model even performs on par with the
original Sa2VA-26B model on the MeViS benchmark. We hope that this work will
show the importance of seemingly trivial implementation details and that it
will provide valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field. We

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，将多光谱数据以零样本方式输入到仅训练过RGB数据的通用多模态模型中，使模型能够理解专业的多光谱信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱图像在遥感应用中很重要，但现有的机器学习模型需要专门训练且成本高，而强大的通用多模态模型无法处理多光谱输入。

Method: 利用多模态模型对视觉空间的理解，将多光谱数据适配到该空间，并将领域特定信息作为指令注入模型，以Gemini2.5模型为例进行验证。

Result: 在土地覆盖和土地利用分类的流行遥感基准测试中，该方法实现了显著的零样本性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了地理空间专业人士可以轻松利用强大的多模态模型来处理非标准专业输入，加速工作流程。

Abstract: Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing
applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and
urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional
spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such
as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,
and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,
only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is
predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for
multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,
although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs
cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are
capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand
specialized multi-spectral signals.
  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new
multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist
multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the
multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to
inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions
into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe
strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing
benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy
adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential
for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to
easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate
their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities,
grounded in the specialized sensor data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学影像模型过于专业化，需要多个专用网络，限制了泛化能力。临床应用需要精确的视觉定位、多模态集成和链式推理能力。

Method: 提出新颖的多模态训练方法，整合检测、分割和多模态链式推理，并发布涵盖推理、检测、分割和文档理解任务的开源数据集。

Result: Citrus-V在多个基准测试中优于现有开源医学模型和专家级影像系统，支持精确病灶量化、自动报告生成和可靠第二意见。

Conclusion: 该模型提供了一个从视觉定位到临床推理的统一流程，为临床诊断、治疗规划和手术决策提供重要证据支持。

Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment
planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly
focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their
generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit
strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications
demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought
reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that
combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection,
segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level
lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like
diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal
training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering
reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks.
Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical
models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering
a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting
precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second
opinions.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多模态大语言模型在零样本设置下检测和描述交通事故的能力，使用基础设施摄像头图像，通过集成视觉分析技术提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通安全是全球关键问题，需要及时准确的事故检测来减少危险并快速响应。基础设施视觉传感器提供可扩展的实时监控解决方案，但缺乏多样化的真实事故数据。

Method: 使用CARLA模拟的DeepAccident数据集，评估Gemini 1.5/2.0、Gemma 3和Pixtral模型的零样本性能，集成YOLO、Deep SORT和SAM等视觉分析技术来增强提示。

Result: Pixtral表现最佳（F1-score 0.71，召回率83%），Gemini模型通过增强提示精度提升（如Gemini 1.5达90%）但F1和召回率下降，Gemma 3性能最平衡。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与先进视觉分析技术结合在自动化交通监控系统中具有巨大应用潜力。

Abstract: Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate
accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response.
Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for
continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci-
dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and
describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus
minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include:
(1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA,
explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based
accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance
analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent
identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3)
Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object
detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for
instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and
explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an
F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with
enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and
recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal
metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of
integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their
applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.

TL;DR: Track-On2是一个基于Transformer的在线长期点跟踪模型，通过架构优化、内存机制改进和合成训练策略提升性能，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期点跟踪问题，需要在视频帧间实现一致的点识别，应对显著的外观变化、运动和遮挡，特别针对在线实时和流式应用场景。

Method: 扩展Track-On模型为Track-On2，采用因果处理框架，通过内存机制保持时间一致性，使用粗粒度补丁级分类后细化的推理策略，并系统研究合成训练对内存行为的影响。

Result: 在五个合成和真实世界基准测试中取得最先进结果，超越现有在线跟踪器甚至利用双向上下文的强离线方法。

Conclusion: 基于因果、内存架构并纯合成数据训练的模型是解决现实世界点跟踪问题的可扩展有效方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which
requires consistent identification of points across video frames under
significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online
setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time
and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2,
a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking.
Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural
refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training
strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or
iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal
coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions
without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level
classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically
study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing
how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive
experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong
offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the
effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic
data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking. Project page:

Abstract: We introduce KAMERA: a comprehensive system for multi-camera, multi-spectral
synchronization and real-time detection of seals and polar bears. Utilized in
aerial surveys for ice-associated seals in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort
seas around Alaska, KAMERA provides up to an 80% reduction in dataset
processing time over previous methods. Our rigorous calibration and hardware
synchronization enable using multiple spectra for object detection. All
collected data are annotated with metadata so they can be easily referenced
later. All imagery and animal detections from a survey are mapped onto a world
plane for accurate surveyed area estimates and quick assessment of survey
results. We hope KAMERA will inspire other mapping and detection efforts in the

TL;DR: NeuCODEX是一种神经形态协同推理架构，通过联合优化空间和时间冗余，显著降低边缘设备的数据传输和能耗，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在边缘计算中具有能效优势，但受限于高延迟和固定时间步长开销。边缘-云协同推理系统面临高延迟和特征传输成本的问题。

Method: 引入学习驱动的脉冲压缩模块减少数据传输，采用动态早退机制根据输出置信度自适应终止推理。在ResNet-18和VGG-16骨干网络上进行原型验证。

Result: 数据传输减少高达2048倍，边缘能耗降低超过90%，端到端延迟相比仅边缘推理降低3倍，精度损失小于2%。

Conclusion: NeuCODEX能够在资源受限环境中实现实用、高性能的SNN部署。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling
energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN
inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy
constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud
co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is
often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these
issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that
jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a
learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs
a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on
output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and
Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To
demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16
backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data
transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing
end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a
negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables
practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

Result: 在恶劣天气条件下显著优于现有最先进的自监督方法，证明了方法的有效性和通用性

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉基础模型的鲁棒先验和场景对应学习，成功解决了自监督立体匹配在恶劣天气条件下的性能退化问题

Abstract: Recent self-supervised stereo matching methods have made significant
progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather
conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses
contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces
noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with
degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded
regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective
supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these
challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual
foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature
representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene
correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than
relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we
create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These
datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic
context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this
knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of
two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse
weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from
clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under
adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Codes are available at

*Siddharth Gupta,Jitin Singla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出YOLO-LAN，一种基于YOLO的息肉检测管道，通过M2IoU损失、数据增强和负样本训练，在结肠镜息肉检测中实现了高精度和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌是一种致命疾病，始于结肠内壁异常黏膜细胞增殖形成的息肉。结肠镜检查是检测息肉的标准方法，但人工检测存在不一致性和遗漏风险。基于深度学习的物体检测可以提供更准确、实时的诊断解决方案。

Method: 提出YOLO-LAN息肉检测管道，使用M2IoU损失函数、多样化数据增强技术和负样本训练，以模拟真实临床情况。基于YOLOv12和YOLOv8架构进行优化。

Result: 在Kvasir-seg和BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp数据集上优于现有方法：YOLOv12达到mAP50为0.9619，mAP50:95为0.8599；YOLOv8达到mAP50为0.9540，mAP50:95为0.8487。在mAP50:95分数上有显著提升，显示息肉检测的精确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在息肉大小和精确定位检测方面表现出鲁棒性，使其在AI辅助结直肠筛查中具有临床相关性。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC), a lethal disease, begins with the growth of abnormal
mucosal cell proliferation called polyps in the inner wall of the colon. When
left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the
standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and
removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be
inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on
deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time
diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based
polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data
augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our
pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp
datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12
and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg
dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing
the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and
precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted
colorectal screening.

Motivation: 探索复杂半监督视频对象分割任务，分析SeC框架在MOSEv2赛道中的表现，研究长期记忆和概念感知记忆对时序连续性和语义先验的贡献。

Method: 通过分析和改进SeC框架（增强的SAM-2框架），详细研究其长期记忆机制（保持遮挡和重现时的时序连续性）和概念感知记忆（提供语义先验抑制干扰物）。

Result: 在MOSEv2测试集上获得39.89%的JF分数，在LSVOS挑战赛MOSEv2赛道中排名第一。

Conclusion: 长期记忆和概念感知记忆的结合有效解决了MOSEv2的核心挑战，长期记忆保持时序连续性，概念感知记忆提供语义先验抑制干扰，这一方案在挑战赛中表现出色。

Abstract: This technical report explores the MOSEv2 track of the LSVOS Challenge, which
targets complex semi-supervised video object segmentation. By analysing and
adapting SeC, an enhanced SAM-2 framework, we conduct a detailed study of its
long-term memory and concept-aware memory, showing that long-term memory
preserves temporal continuity under occlusion and reappearance, while
concept-aware memory supplies semantic priors that suppress distractors;
together, these traits directly benefit several MOSEv2's core challenges. Our
solution achieves a JF score of 39.89% on the test set, ranking 1st in the
MOSEv2 track of the LSVOS Challenge.

*Yueyan Li,Chenggong Zhao,Zeyuan Zang,Caixia Yuan,Xiaojie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的视觉处理机制，基于人类视觉的双流假说将其分解为物体识别和空间感知两个部分进行研究，并提出了提升解码效率和空间推理能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs通过序列化图像处理视觉信息，这与人类视觉的并行处理方式存在差异，且模型内部机制不透明，阻碍了深入理解和架构创新。

Method: 将视觉处理分解为物体识别（通过文本标记映射分析）和空间感知（理论推导和实验验证位置表示的几何结构），并提出了基于即插即用视觉解码器的指令无关标记压缩算法和RoPE缩放技术。

Result: 研究发现模型对图像内容的感知呈现从浅层到深层的两阶段过程（属性识别到语义消歧），并验证了VLMs中位置表示的几何结构。

Conclusion: 研究验证了对VLM内部机制的分析，为深入理解VLMs和设计更强大未来架构提供了清晰原则。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual
information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from
the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms
hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the
dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and
"where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object
recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition,
we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of
image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers,
beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic
disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically
verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in
VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token
compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve
decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning.
Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a
deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for
designing more capable future architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需视觉编码器的文本到文本检索方法，通过VLLM生成结构化图像描述来替代传统视觉语言模型，解决了模态鸿沟问题并提升了组合性能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习的视觉语言模型存在浅层语言理解、模态鸿沟、计算成本高和隐私问题等局限性，需要探索更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用文本到文本检索范式，使用VLLM生成结构化图像描述，仅需少量GPU小时进行校准，构建了subFlickr和subCOCO两个新的组合性基准。

Result: 视觉无关检索器在多个检索和组合性基准上达到最先进的零样本性能，甚至超越传统多模态模型，且仅需0.3B参数的小模型。

Conclusion: 文本到文本检索范式能有效减少模态鸿沟，提升组合性能力，同时提供更隐私友好的解决方案，证明了视觉编码器在检索任务中并非必要。

Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have
become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language
representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language
understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are
reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap.
Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training
makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy
concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the
necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free,
single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image
retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance
of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this
paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of
the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short
and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration
on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions
introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess
generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality
benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO,
containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin
subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses
traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and
compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了对比视觉语言模型中组合性与长标题理解之间的双向关系，发现两者可以相互促进，但训练效果受数据质量和模型设计影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比视觉语言模型在绑定视觉和文本信息方面取得进展，但理解长而密集的标题仍是一个开放挑战。作者假设组合性（推理对象属性绑定和对象间关系的能力）是理解长标题的关键。

Method: 训练和评估了一系列针对组合性和长标题理解能力的模型，研究了不同训练策略（如冻结位置嵌入）和数据质量对性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现组合性训练能提高长标题检索性能，长标题训练也能促进组合性，但这些增益对数据质量和模型设计敏感。高质量长标题数据训练可以实现两个任务的强性能。

Conclusion: 组合性理解和长标题理解是相互交织的能力，可以通过在密集、接地气的描述上进行训练来共同学习，为改进VLM泛化提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
binding visual and textual information, but understanding long, dense captions
remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity
to reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is
key to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking
whether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a
range of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a
bidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on
long-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes
compositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model
design. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited
parameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that
aim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do
not improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional
understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that
can be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions.
Despite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality,
long-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering
practical guidance for improving VLM generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热图像中植物分割在户外高通量表型分析中面临挑战，主要由于植物与杂草对比度低和频繁遮挡导致性能不佳

Method: 使用1,128张合成图像训练模型生成作物和杂草分割掩码，并评估整合少量真实标注图像的效果，通过CycleGAN-turbo实现RGB到热图像的跨模态对齐

Result: 结合所有合成图像和少量真实标注图像，杂草类相对改进22%，植物类相对改进17%，相比全真实数据基线有显著提升

Conclusion: 合成数据与有限手动标注结合，通过生成模型的跨域转换可以显著提升复杂田间环境中多模态图像的语义分割性能

Abstract: Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery remains a significant
challenge for high throughput field phenotyping, particularly in outdoor
environments where low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent
occlusions hinder performance. To address this, we present a framework that
leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and
GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal
images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures
of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop
and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as
five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using
various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few
labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the
weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline.
Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using
CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results
demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and
cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost
segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

Abstract: Evaluation of hydrocephalus in children is challenging, and the related
research is limited by a lack of publicly available, expert-annotated datasets,
particularly those with segmentation of the choroid plexus. To address this, we
present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with
hydrocephalus. 3D MRIs were provided with 1mm isotropic resolution, which was
reconstructed from routine low-resolution images using a slice-to-volume
algorithm. Manually corrected segmentations of brain tissues, including white
matter, grey matter, lateral ventricle, external CSF, and the choroid plexus,
were provided by an experienced neurologist. Additionally, structured data was
extracted from clinical radiology reports using a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation framework. The strong correlation between choroid plexus volume and
total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation,
achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The
proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging
algorithms development, and it revealed the choroid plexus-related features in
hydrocephalus assessments. Our datasets are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度特征交互网络（MsFIN）用于行车记录仪视频的早期事故预测，通过多尺度特征聚合、时序特征处理和后融合来解决交通参与者特征交互和复杂多时序行为建模的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着行车记录仪的普及和计算机视觉技术的发展，从行车记录仪视角开发事故预测模型对于主动安全干预变得至关重要。但存在两个关键挑战：建模交通参与者之间的特征级交互（在行车记录仪视图中经常被遮挡）和捕捉事故前复杂的异步多时序行为线索。

Method: MsFIN包含三个层次：多尺度特征聚合层使用多尺度模块提取短期、中期和长期时序尺度的场景表示，并利用Transformer架构促进全面特征交互；时序特征处理层在因果约束下捕捉场景和对象特征的序列演化；多尺度特征后融合层将多个时序尺度的场景和对象特征融合生成全面的风险表示。

Result: 在DAD和DADA数据集上的实验表明，MsFIN在预测准确性和及时性方面显著优于采用单尺度特征提取的最先进模型。消融研究验证了MsFIN中每个模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MsFIN通过多尺度特征融合和上下文交互建模实现了优越的性能，为行车记录仪视频的早期事故预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer
vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has
become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges
persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often
occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal
behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a
Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage
accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for
multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale
feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a
Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term,
mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture
is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature
processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under
causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network
fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a
comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show
that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale
feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation
studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how
the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion
and contextual interaction modeling.

Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses
significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse
evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection
capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types
of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with
limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned
forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant
and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously
evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical
infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face
forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to
develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual
experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and
refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental
information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting,
we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the
established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the
orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the
training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and
manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于概念的视频相似度估计任务（ConViS），通过预定义的关键语义概念计算可解释的相似度分数，使视频比较更接近人类推理方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频相似度评估主要依赖全局相似度分数，无法像人类那样从多个方面（如动作、地点等）进行细粒度比较。大型多模态模型的出现为利用自然语言进行视频比较任务提供了新机会。

Method: 引入ConViS任务和ConViS-Bench基准数据集，包含多个领域精心标注的视频对，每个视频对都有概念级相似度分数以及差异和相似性的文本描述。

Result: 在ConViS基准上对多个最先进模型进行测试，结果显示不同概念对视频相似度估计的挑战程度存在显著差异。

Conclusion: ConViS-Bench将成为推动语言驱动视频理解研究的重要资源，有助于开发更接近人类推理方式的视频比较模型。

Abstract: What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar
when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated
based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare
videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been
thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on
broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video
understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural
language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video
Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by
computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key
semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video
similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video
retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new
benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains.
Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions
of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several
state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with
human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on
ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating
video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable
resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.

Abstract: Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer
vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient
compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion
dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework
with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while
preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense
motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates
reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment
observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic
dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming
the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%.
Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion
complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a
compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much
larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish
practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex
spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new
Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional
heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of
sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes
graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The
resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the
ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies
from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was
evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor
recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain
metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional
setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In
GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs
pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over
comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs
radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk
stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10%
improvement.

TL;DR: CLOPS是第一个仅使用自我中心视觉感知环境并导航的人类化身，通过将低级运动技能学习与高级视觉控制解耦，实现了人类化的运动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类运动生成方法忽略了感知与运动的相互依赖关系，使用与人类感知方式截然不同的任务特定感知。作者认为生成人类化化身行为需要人类化的感知。

Method: 首先在大型运动捕捉数据集上训练运动先验模型，然后使用Q学习训练策略，将自我中心视觉输入映射到运动先验的高级控制命令。

Result: 实验证明自我中心视觉能够使化身产生人类化运动特征，例如根据视觉场中的障碍物调整行走路径以避免碰撞。

Conclusion: 为化身配备人类化传感器（特别是自我中心视觉）有望训练出行为像人类的化身。

Abstract: The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is
how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human
motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific
``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the
generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception.
Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely
uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision
as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge
for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion,
without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by
decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level
control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model
on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning
to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion
prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give
rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the
avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field.
These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors,
particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave
like humans.

Motivation: 当前布局到图像生成方法在处理包含显著重叠边界框的布局时表现不佳，特别是在大重叠区域和语义区分度小的重叠实例情况下。现有基准存在偏向简单案例的偏差。

Method: 1. 提出OverLayScore指标量化重叠边界框的复杂性；2. 构建OverLayBench基准，包含高质量标注和平衡的OverLayScore分布；3. 提出CreatiLayout-AM模型，在精选的amodal掩码数据集上进行微调。

Conclusion: 该研究为在现实和挑战性场景下实现更鲁棒的布局到图像生成奠定了基础，提出的指标和基准将推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still
struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We
identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2)
overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both
qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these
factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we
introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of
overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are
biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their
effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging
conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark
featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different
levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on
complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a
curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for
more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging
scenarios. Project link: https://mlpc-ucsd.github.io/OverLayBench.

TL;DR: VolSplat提出了一种新的多视图前馈3D高斯泼溅方法，用体素对齐的高斯预测替代传统的像素对齐方法，解决了现有方法对输入视图数量的依赖、视角偏差密度分布和对齐误差等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于像素对齐的高斯预测方法存在三个主要问题：重建的3D模型严重依赖输入视图数量、产生视角偏差的密度分布、在源视图存在遮挡或低纹理时引入对齐误差。

Method: VolSplat通过从预测的3D体素网格直接预测高斯，替代了基于2D特征匹配的像素对齐方法，实现了多视图一致性，并能根据3D场景复杂度自适应控制高斯密度。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和ScanNet等基准测试中，VolSplat实现了最先进的性能，产生更可信和视角一致的3D高斯重建，渲染质量得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅取得了优越的结果，还为前馈3D重建建立了一个更可扩展的框架，提供了更密集和更鲁棒的表示，为更广泛社区的研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective
solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a
pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a
3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several
inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent
on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and
introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions
or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new
multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with
voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D
voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature
matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables
adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding
more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and
enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent
Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach
establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with
denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in
wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on
our project page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat.

TL;DR: CAR-Flow是一种条件感知重参数化方法，通过调整源分布和目标分布来缩短概率路径，从而加速流匹配模型的训练并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散和流匹配方法需要模型同时学习质量传输和条件注入，这增加了模型的学习负担。为了减轻模型负担，作者提出了条件感知重参数化方法。

Method: CAR-Flow通过学习一个轻量级的位移来调整源分布、目标分布或两者，从而缩短模型需要学习的概率路径。该方法在流匹配框架中实现，引入的参数增量小于0.6%。

Result: 在低维合成数据上可视化和量化了CAR的效果。在ImageNet-256数据集上，将CAR-Flow应用于SiT-XL/2模型，FID从2.07降低到1.68。

Conclusion: CAR-Flow通过简单的条件感知重参数化，有效缩短了概率路径，加速了训练过程并提升了生成质量，是一种高效的条件生成建模方法。

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution
from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and
flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a
learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that
ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence
required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the
demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow
Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source,
the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow
shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training
in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the
effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256),
equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while
introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

TL;DR: 使用图像机器学习模型分析Ulam螺旋中不同区域的质数分布规律性，发现在较大数字区域（约5亿附近）比小数字区域（低于2500万）更容易学习到质数模式，表明质数分布在大尺度上具有更强的规律性。

Motivation: 质数在定义上是确定性的，但表现出类似随机过程的统计行为。研究旨在探索机器学习能否作为数论的新实验工具，特别是分析质数在不同数量级区域的分布规律。

Method: 采用图像聚焦的机器学习模型，从Ulam螺旋的不同区域提取数据块进行训练和比较，具体对比了5亿附近区域和低于2500万区域的模型性能。

Result: 在5亿附近区域训练的模型在准确率上优于在2500万以下区域训练的模型，表明前者存在更易学习的规律性。精度和召回率分析显示模型在不同区域采用不同的分类策略。

Conclusion: 机器学习可以作为数论研究的新实验工具，特别是在分析强质数和弱质数模式以用于密码学目的方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Research on the distribution of prime numbers has revealed a dual character:
deterministic in definition yet exhibiting statistical behavior reminiscent of
random processes. In this paper we show that it is possible to use an
image-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of
prime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we
demonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted
from regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on
blocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This
implies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in
the latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem
to imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in
different regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at
lower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns
with number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we
should see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages
(density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness
regularises after scaling by log x. Taken together, these findings point toward
an interesting possibility: that machine learning can serve as a new
experimental instrument for number theory. Notably, the method shows potential
1 for investigating the patterns in strong and weak primes for cryptographic
purposes.

Motivation: 在AI时代，数据市场需要促进数据产品交换，但联邦学习中异构数据源的有效估值和选择仍是关键挑战。现有方法难以在保护隐私的同时准确预测模型性能。

Method: 提出基于Wasserstein距离的估计器框架，包括：1）分布式近似Wasserstein距离方法（无需访问原始数据）；2）利用神经缩放定律外推模型性能；3）评估数据异构性与FL聚合算法的兼容性。

Result: 在标签偏斜、错误标签和未标记数据等多种场景下的广泛实验表明，该方法能一致性地识别高性能数据组合，显著提升模型性能预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更可靠的基于联邦学习的模型市场铺平了道路，通过隐私保护的Wasserstein距离估计实现了有效的数据选择和估值。

Abstract: In the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), marketplaces have become
essential platforms for facilitating the exchange of data products to foster
data sharing. Model transactions provide economic solutions in data
marketplaces that enhance data reusability and ensure the traceability of data
ownership. To establish trustworthy data marketplaces, Federated Learning (FL)
has emerged as a promising paradigm to enable collaborative learning across
siloed datasets while safeguarding data privacy. However, effective data
valuation and selection from heterogeneous sources in the FL setup remain key
challenges. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework centered on a
Wasserstein-based estimator tailored for FL. The estimator not only predicts
model performance across unseen data combinations but also reveals the
compatibility between data heterogeneity and FL aggregation algorithms. To
ensure privacy, we propose a distributed method to approximate Wasserstein
distance without requiring access to raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
model performance can be reliably extrapolated under the neural scaling law,
enabling effective data selection without full-scale training. Extensive
experiments across diverse scenarios, such as label skew, mislabeled, and
unlabeled sources, show that our approach consistently identifies
high-performing data combinations, paving the way for more reliable FL-based
model marketplaces.

Motivation: 研究在随机需求下连续时间库存动态的学习，量化结构约束在不同需求模式下对牛鞭效应预测的帮助或阻碍

Method: 使用单级测试平台，比较完全学习的NODE和保留守恒结构与订单策略的UDE，在AR(1)、i.i.d.高斯和重尾对数正态三种需求模式下进行训练和评估

Result: 在结构化需求模式下，UDE泛化能力更好（AR(1)下库存RMSE从4.92降至0.26，高斯需求下从5.96降至0.95）；在重尾对数正态冲击下，NODE的灵活性更优

Conclusion: 当噪声为轻尾或时间相关时应强制执行结构约束；当极端事件主导时应放松结构约束。这为科学和工程系统中的混合建模提供了指导

Abstract: We study learning of continuous-time inventory dynamics under stochastic
demand and quantify when structure helps or hurts forecasting of the bullwhip
effect. BULL-ODE compares a fully learned Neural ODE (NODE) that models the
entire right-hand side against a physics-informed Universal Differential
Equation (UDE) that preserves conservation and order-up-to structure while
learning a small residual policy term. Classical supply chain models explain
the bullwhip through control/forecasting choices and information sharing, while
recent physics-informed and neural differential equation methods blend domain
constraints with learned components. It is unclear whether structural bias
helps or hinders forecasting under different demand regimes. We address this by
using a single-echelon testbed with three demand regimes - AR(1)
(autocorrelated), i.i.d. Gaussian, and heavy-tailed lognormal. Training is done
on varying fractions of each trajectory, followed by evaluation of multi-step
forecasts for inventory I, order rate O, and demand D. Across the structured
regimes, UDE consistently generalizes better: with 90% of the training horizon,
inventory RMSE drops from 4.92 (NODE) to 0.26 (UDE) under AR(1) and from 5.96
to 0.95 under Gaussian demand. Under heavy-tailed lognormal shocks, the
flexibility of NODE is better. These trends persist as train18 ing data
shrinks, with NODE exhibiting phase drift in extrapolation while UDE remains
stable but underreacts to rare spikes. Our results provide concrete guidance:
enforce structure when noise is light-tailed or temporally correlated; relax
structure when extreme events dominate. Beyond inventory control, the results
offer guidance for hybrid modeling in scientific and engineering systems:
enforce known structure when conservation laws and modest noise dominate, and
relax structure to capture extremes in settings where rare events drive
dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法增强了实时监测能力，实现了跨结构知识转移，促进了智能监测策略的发展，并在网络层面提高了韧性。

Abstract: The growing use of permanent monitoring systems has increased data
availability, offering new opportunities for structural assessment but also
posing scalability challenges, especially across large bridge networks.
Managing multiple structures requires tracking and comparing long-term
behaviour efficiently. To address this, knowledge transfer between similar
structures becomes essential. This study proposes a model-based transfer
learning approach using neural network surrogate models, enabling a model
trained on one bridge to be adapted to another with similar characteristics.
These models capture shared damage mechanisms, supporting a scalable and
generalizable monitoring framework. The method was validated using real data
from two bridges. The transferred model was integrated into a Bayesian
inference framework for continuous damage assessment based on modal features
from monitoring data. Results showed high sensitivity to damage location,
severity, and extent. This approach enhances real-time monitoring and enables
cross-structure knowledge transfer, promoting smart monitoring strategies and
improved resilience at the network level.

Conclusion: AdaMixT通过自适应多尺度专家融合机制，显著提升了多元时间序列预测的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting involves predicting future values based
on historical observations. However, existing approaches primarily rely on
predefined single-scale patches or lack effective mechanisms for multi-scale
feature fusion. These limitations hinder them from fully capturing the complex
patterns inherent in time series, leading to constrained performance and
insufficient generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture named Adaptive Weighted Mixture of Multi-Scale Expert Transformers
(AdaMixT). Specifically, AdaMixT introduces various patches and leverages both
General Pre-trained Models (GPM) and Domain-specific Models (DSM) for
multi-scale feature extraction. To accommodate the heterogeneity of temporal
features, AdaMixT incorporates a gating network that dynamically allocates
weights among different experts, enabling more accurate predictions through
adaptive multi-scale fusion. Comprehensive experiments on eight widely used
benchmarks, including Weather, Traffic, Electricity, ILI, and four ETT
datasets, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaMixT in real-world
scenarios.

Motivation: 准确识别船舶类型对于海上安全监管和打击非法、未报告和不受管制(IUU)活动至关重要。传统方法依赖人工报告，而AIS数据提供了自动化分类的可能性。

Method: 构建机器学习管道，从AIS轨迹中提取31个特征（运动学、时空、船舶形状等），使用随机森林模型，采用分组训练/测试分割和5折交叉验证，避免数据泄露。

Result: 在5类船舶（货船、油轮、客船、高速艇、渔船）分类任务中，随机森林模型达到92.15%的准确率，宏平均F1分数为93.27%，ROC-AUC最高达0.9897。

Conclusion: 基于AIS轨迹的轻量级特征能够实现实时船舶类型分类，该方法在狭窄海峡具有实用价值，未来可通过改进轨迹分割和集成学习进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of vessel types from Automatic Identification System
(AIS) tracks is essential for safety oversight and combating illegal,
unreported, and unregulated (IUU) activity. This paper presents a strait-scale,
machine-learning pipeline that classifies moving vessels using only AIS data.
We analyze eight days of historical AIS from the Danish Maritime Authority
covering the Bornholm Strait in the Baltic Sea (January 22-30, 2025). After
forward/backward filling voyage records, removing kinematic and geospatial
outliers, and segmenting per-MMSI tracks while excluding stationary periods
($\ge 1$ h), we derive 31 trajectory-level features spanning kinematics (e.g.,
SOG statistics), temporal, geospatial (Haversine distances, spans), and
ship-shape attributes computed from AIS A/B/C/D reference points (length,
width, aspect ratio, bridge-position ratio). To avoid leakage, we perform
grouped train/test splits by MMSI and use stratified 5-fold cross-validation.
Across five classes (cargo, tanker, passenger, high-speed craft, fishing;
N=1{,}910 trajectories; test=382), tree-based models dominate: a Random Forest
with SMOTE attains 92.15% accuracy (macro-precision 94.11%, macro-recall
92.51%, macro-F1 93.27%) on the held-out test set, while a tuned RF reaches
one-vs-rest ROC-AUC up to 0.9897. Feature-importance analysis highlights the
bridge-position ratio and maximum SOG as the most discriminative signals;
principal errors occur between cargo and tanker, reflecting similar transit
behavior. We demonstrate operational value by backfilling missing ship types on
unseen data and discuss improvements such as DBSCAN based trip segmentation and
gradient-boosted ensembles to handle frequent-stop ferries and further lift
performance. The results show that lightweight features over AIS trajectories
enable real-time vessel type classification in straits.

Conclusion: 该方法为PDE系统中高效算子学习提供了一种有前景的技术

Abstract: Neural operator learning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven manner. However,
applying principal component analysis (PCA) to high-dimensional solution fields
incurs significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose a
patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller
patches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the
reduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that
balance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1)
local-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off
between computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the
advantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach,
we explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i)
introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a
two-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our
results demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational
complexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline
processing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore
making it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based
systems.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合子空间表示学习和提示调优，显著提升了ID-OOD的可分离性，同时保持了高ID分类精度。

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world
settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using
only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt
learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking
the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs
trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace
representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD
separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt
vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space.
To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end
learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as
high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase
the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面比较了最先进的人工智能方法在自动产前CTG分析中的应用，发现经过微调的大型语言模型在性能上优于基础模型和领域特定方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子胎儿监护/胎心监护在评估胎儿健康方面是关键技术，但目前基础模型和大型语言模型在该领域的潜力尚未充分探索。CTG评估主要依赖主观临床解释，导致诊断准确性存在差异和延迟。

Method: 系统比较了时间序列基础模型、大型语言模型与已建立的CTG特定架构，评估了500多个不同时长的CTG记录，反映了真实世界的临床记录。

Result: 研究结果表明，经过微调的大型语言模型在性能上优于基础模型和领域特定方法，为临床CTG解释提供了一条有前景的替代途径。

Conclusion: 这些发现为胎儿监护应用中不同人工智能方法的相对优势提供了重要见解，并为未来产前护理中临床人工智能的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains through training on massive
datasets. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance in healthcare
applications, yet their potential for electronic fetal monitoring
(EFM)/cardiotocography (CTG) analysis, a critical technology for evaluating
fetal well-being, remains largely underexplored. Antepartum CTG interpretation
presents unique challenges due to the complex nature of fetal heart rate (FHR)
patterns and uterine activity, requiring sophisticated analysis of long
time-series data. The assessment of CTG is heavily based on subjective clinical
interpretation, often leading to variability in diagnostic accuracy and
deviation from timely pregnancy care. This study presents the first
comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art AI approaches for automated
antepartum CTG analysis. We systematically compare time-series FMs and LLMs
against established CTG-specific architectures. Our evaluation encompasses over
500 CTG recordings of varying durations reflecting real-world clinical
recordings, providing robust performance benchmarks across different modelling
paradigms. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior
performance compared to both foundation models and domain-specific approaches,
offering a promising alternative pathway for clinical CTG interpretation. These
findings provide critical insights into the relative strengths of different AI
methodologies for fetal monitoring applications and establish a foundation for
future clinical AI development in prenatal care.

Conclusion: DPU辅助框架能够有效检测和缓解多节点张量并行推理中的负载不平衡问题，提高LLM推理的运行时效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive inference in large transformer-based language models (LLMs)
presents significant challenges for runtime efficiency, particularly during the
decode phase where load imbalance across GPU shards can cause throughput
degradation and latency spikes. A DPU-assisted framework leveraged by
BlueField-3 Data Processing Units can enable real-time detection and mitigation
of load imbalance in multi-node tensor-parallel inference. By offloading
monitoring tasks to the DPU and analyzing GPU telemetry and inter-node
communication patterns, the resulting system can provide actionable feedback to
inference controllers and schedulers. The goal of this study is three-fold i)
identify the reported skews/imbalances/pathological conditions that arise in
muti-GPU execution of a) LLM tensor computing (both during training and
inference), b) identify their impact on computational performance, and c) make
a critical assessment if those can be tracked for potential mitigation from a
DPU network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的空间平衡注意力块用于时空预测，通过将空间图划分为子图，结合子图内注意力学习局部空间相关性，以及子图间注意力捕获全局空间相关性，构建了多尺度时空预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在遵循空间邻近性和捕获全局相关性之间取得平衡，传统方法往往难以同时兼顾局部和全局空间关系，需要一种能够有效平衡这两种需求的新方法。

Method: 将空间图划分为多个子图，使用子图内注意力学习局部空间相关性，通过子图聚合和子图间注意力实现子图间的消息传递以捕获全局相关性，并构建多尺度模型逐步增加子图规模。

Result: 在真实世界的中大型时空数据集上评估，相比基线方法性能提升最高达7.7%，且运行成本较低。

Conclusion: 所提出的空间平衡注意力块能够有效平衡局部和全局空间相关性，构建的模型具有可扩展性、结构化空间相关性以及易于实现的优点，在保持低运行成本的同时显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Balance Attention block for
spatiotemporal forecasting. To strike a balance between obeying spatial
proximity and capturing global correlation, we partition the spatial graph into
a set of subgraphs and instantiate Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local
spatial correlation within each subgraph; to capture the global spatial
correlation, we further aggregate the nodes to produce subgraph representations
and achieve message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention.
Building on the proposed Spatial Balance Attention block, we develop a
multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively increasing the
subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce
structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. We
evaluate its efficacy and efficiency against the existing models on real-world
spatiotemporal datasets from medium to large sizes. The experimental results
show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 7.7% over the baseline
methods at low running costs.

*Nathan Egbuna,Saatvik Gaur,Sunishchal Dev,Ashwinee Panda,Maheep Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALS（Amortized Latent Steering）通过离线计算单个向量来替代昂贵的逐查询优化循环，在推理时以恒定成本应用，实现了2-5倍的速度提升，同时匹配或超越了贪婪CoT和Self-Consistency基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时优化方法（如迭代优化和多步验证）推理成本过高，难以大规模应用。虽然LatentSeek等方法通过操纵隐藏表示提供了更直接的方法，但仍需要昂贵的逐查询优化循环。

Method: ALS计算成功与不成功生成的隐藏状态的平均差异，然后使用这个方向来校准模型的隐藏表示：当解码偏离成功流形时，ALS将激活状态推回该流形。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH-500基准测试中，ALS相比迭代方法实现了2-5倍的速度提升，同时匹配或超越了贪婪CoT和Self-Consistency基线，效率-准确率权衡提升了最高101%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，潜在优化的许多好处可以通过离线方式获得，使得复杂的推理技术能够在生产环境中实际部署。

Abstract: Test-time optimization remains impractical at scale due to prohibitive
inference costs\textemdash techniques like iterative refinement and multi-step
verification can require $10$--$100\times$ more compute per query than standard
decoding. Latent space test-time optimization methods like LatentSeek offer a
more direct approach by steering hidden representations, but still demand
expensive per-query optimization loops with multiple backward passes. We
propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative
optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost
during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from
successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to
calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from
the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and
MATH-$500$ benchmarks, ALS achieves $2$--$5\times$ speedup over iterative
methods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Self-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101\% improvement in
efficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent
optimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning
techniques viable for production deployment. Code is available

online incremental learning, allowing reliable predictions even with little

a task model, providing a graphical representation of navigation with the usage
statistics of the current user. The algorithm learns new tasks while preserving
prior knowledge. The theoretical framework is described, and simulations show
the effectiveness of the approach in stationary and non-stationary
environments. In conclusion, this research paves the way for adaptive systems
that improve the user experience by helping them to better navigate and act on
their interface.

TL;DR: 将轻量级随机梯度下降（L-SGD）算法扩展到RISC-V架构的微控制器上，通过8位量化版本显著降低内存使用和加速训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物联网设备缺乏GPU和专用加速器的问题，避免依赖云服务的隐私和连接性问题，为RISC-V这一新兴开源架构提供本地训练支持。

Method: 扩展L-SGD算法到RISC-V MCU平台，开发8位量化版本以应对RISC-V缺乏浮点运算单元的限制。

Result: 在RISC-V平台上，8位量化L-SGD实现内存使用减少近4倍，训练速度提升2.2倍，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 成功将L-SGD适配到RISC-V架构，证明了在资源受限的RISC-V MCU上进行高效本地训练的可行性。

Abstract: Modern IoT devices increasingly rely on machine learning solutions to process
data locally. However, the lack of graphics processing units (GPUs) or
dedicated accelerators on most platforms makes on-device training largely
infeasible, often requiring cloud-based services to perform this task. This
procedure often raises privacy-related concerns, and creates dependency on
reliable and always-on connectivity. Federated Learning (FL) is a new trend
that addresses these issues by enabling decentralized and collaborative
training directly on devices, but it requires highly efficient optimization
algorithms. L-SGD, a lightweight variant of stochastic gradient descent, has
enabled neural network training on Arm Cortex-M Microcontroller Units (MCUs).
This work extends L-SGD to RISC-V-based MCUs, an open and emerging architecture
that still lacks robust support for on-device training. L-SGD was evaluated on
both Arm and RISC-V platforms using 32-bit floating-point arithmetic,
highlighting the performance impact of the absence of Floating-Point Units
(FPUs) in RISC-V MCUs. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce an 8-bit
quantized version of L-SGD for RISC-V, which achieves nearly 4x reduction in
memory usage and a 2.2x speedup in training time, with negligible accuracy
degradation.

Motivation: 开发有效的移动GUI代理面临任务难度分布重尾和大规模环境采样效率低下的挑战。

Method: 提出MOBILERL框架，核心是难度自适应GRPO算法，包括难度自适应正向回放和失败课程过滤，以及最短路径奖励调整策略。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct和GLM-4.1V-9B-Base模型上应用，MOBILERL-9B在AndroidWorld上达到75.8%的成功率，在AndroidLab上达到46.8%的成功率。

Conclusion: MOBILERL框架能稳定强化学习训练，提高样本效率，在多样化移动应用和任务中表现出色，已被集成到AutoGLM产品中并开源。

Abstract: Building general-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) agents has become
increasingly promising with the progress in vision language models. However,
developing effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains
challenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the
inefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic
reinforcement learning framework MOBILERL to enhance GUI agents in mobile
environments. Its core component is the Difficulty-Adaptive GRPO (ADAGRPO)
algorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and
failure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties.
We introduce the shortest path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards
concerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies
jointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong
performance across diverse mobile apps and tasks. We apply MOBILERL to two open
models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Base). The resultant MOBILERL-9B
model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of success rates on both
AndroidWorld (75.8%) and AndroidLab (46.8%). The MOBILERL framework is adopted
in the AutoGLM products, and also open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨机构联邦学习面临统计异构性和经济竞争的双重挑战，组织因市场竞争可能不愿参与联合训练，现有研究对这两种因素的综合影响探索不足。

Method: CoCoGen通过学习和效用公式刻画竞争与统计异构性，将每轮训练建模为加权势博弈，并推导基于生成式AI的数据生成策略。

Result: 在Fashion-MNIST数据集上的实验表明，CoCoGen在不同异构性和竞争水平下均优于基线方法，能有效优化组织行为和社会福利。

Conclusion: CoCoGen框架成功解决了联邦学习中的合作竞争平衡问题，为异构竞争环境下的协作学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (CFL) enables organizations (e.g., hospitals or
banks) to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while
preserving data privacy by keeping data local. While prior work has primarily
addressed statistical heterogeneity across organizations, a critical challenge
arises from economic competition, where organizations may act as market rivals,
making them hesitant to participate in joint training due to potential utility
loss (i.e., reduced net benefit). Furthermore, the combined effects of
statistical heterogeneity and inter-organizational competition on
organizational behavior and system-wide social welfare remain underexplored. In
this paper, we propose CoCoGen, a coopetitive-compatible data generation
framework, leveraging generative AI (GenAI) and potential game theory to model,
analyze, and optimize collaborative learning under heterogeneous and
competitive settings. Specifically, CoCoGen characterizes competition and
statistical heterogeneity through learning performance and utility-based
formulations and models each training round as a weighted potential game. We
then derive GenAI-based data generation strategies that maximize social
welfare. Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST dataset reveal how varying
heterogeneity and competition levels affect organizational behavior and
demonstrate that CoCoGen consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: This study explores the application of supervised machine learning algorithms
to predict coffee ratings based on a combination of influential textual and
numerical attributes extracted from user reviews. Through careful data
preprocessing including text cleaning, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and
selection with SelectKBest, the study identifies key factors contributing to
coffee quality assessments. Six models (Decision Tree, KNearest Neighbors,
Multi-layer Perceptron, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost) were trained
and evaluated using optimized hyperparameters. Model performance was assessed
primarily using F1-score, Gmean, and AUC metrics. Results demonstrate that
ensemble methods (Extra Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost), as well as
Multi-layer Perceptron, consistently outperform simpler classifiers (Decision
Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors) in terms of evaluation metrics such as F1
scores, G-mean and AUC. The findings highlight the essence of rigorous feature
selection and hyperparameter tuning in building robust predictive systems for
sensory product evaluation, offering a data driven approach to complement
traditional coffee cupping by expertise of trained professionals.

Motivation: 医疗系统面临有限护理资源的高效分配压力，需要考虑技能异质性、患者病情、员工疲劳度和护理连续性等多重因素，传统优化和启发式方法难以有效处理这些动态多约束环境。

Method: 提出NurseSchedRL框架，使用近端策略优化（PPO）结合可行性掩码，集成结构化状态编码、约束动作掩码以及基于注意力的技能、疲劳和地理上下文表示。

Result: 在真实护士和患者数据的模拟中，NurseSchedRL相比基线启发式和无约束RL方法，实现了更高的排班效率、更好的技能与患者需求匹配度以及更低的疲劳度。

Conclusion: 结果表明强化学习在复杂高风险医疗人力管理决策支持中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Healthcare systems face increasing pressure to allocate limited nursing
resources efficiently while accounting for skill heterogeneity, patient acuity,
staff fatigue, and continuity of care. Traditional optimization and heuristic
scheduling methods struggle to capture these dynamic, multi-constraint
environments. I propose NurseSchedRL, a reinforcement learning framework for
nurse-patient assignment that integrates structured state encoding, constrained
action masking, and attention-based representations of skills, fatigue, and
geographical context. NurseSchedRL uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with
feasibility masks to ensure assignments respect real-world constraints, while
dynamically adapting to patient arrivals and varying nurse availability. In
simulation with realistic nurse and patient data, NurseSchedRL achieves
improved scheduling efficiency, better alignment of skills to patient needs,
and reduced fatigue compared to baseline heuristic and unconstrained RL
approaches. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for
decision support in complex, high-stakes healthcare workforce management.

Motivation: 随着电动汽车基础设施的快速发展，保护基于物联网的充电站免受网络威胁变得至关重要。集中式入侵检测系统存在隐私问题，而联邦学习是一种有前景的替代方案，但现有评估忽略了系统异构性和非IID数据等实际挑战。

Method: 使用FedAvg和FedAvgM两种广泛研究的优化方法，在系统异构性和非IID数据条件下进行实验，评估联邦学习在电动汽车充电站异常检测中的性能。

Result: 在IID设置下，FedAvg使用相同神经网络时性能优于集中式模型。但在非IID数据和系统异构性条件下性能下降。FedAvgM在异构设置下始终优于FedAvg，表现出更好的收敛性和更高的异常检测准确率。

Conclusion: 联邦学习能够在不显著损失性能的情况下处理物联网电动汽车充电站的异构性，FedAvgM是构建鲁棒、隐私保护的电动汽车充电站安全的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized training framework widely used in
IoT ecosystems that preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, making it
ideal for IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems with sensing and communication
like Smart Grids (SGs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), and Electric
Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS). With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle
infrastructure, securing these IoT-based charging stations against cyber
threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a
promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook
practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address
these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of
federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system
and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization
approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID
settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the
same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system
heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous
settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our
results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without
significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust,
privacy-preserving EVCS security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全研究主要关注评估LLM输出或特定安全任务，无法应对更广泛的未定义风险。SAE虽然有助于解释模型行为，但之前的研究未能将特征与细粒度的安全概念联系起来，无法充分解决安全关键行为。

Method: 提出Safe-SAIL框架，系统识别具有最佳概念特定可解释性的SAE，解释安全相关神经元，并引入高效策略来扩展解释过程。

Result: 将发布包含SAE检查点和人类可读神经元解释的全面工具包，支持对安全风险的实证分析。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解释SAE特征来促进LLM安全研究，有助于更深入地理解模型的安全相关行为机制。

Abstract: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world
applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research
focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their
ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)
facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining
single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever,
prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained
safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical
behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu-
lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set
of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors,
yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for
generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of
detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a
framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic
understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE
with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons,
and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process.
We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and
human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of
safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.

Motivation: 机器学习代理模型在物理可靠性分析中广泛应用，但模型近似误差引入的认知不确定性会与模型输入的偶然不确定性耦合，影响可靠性预测的准确性

Method: 使用Gauss-Hermite积分方法解耦嵌套不确定性，在一阶和二阶可靠性方法下评估偶然不确定性条件下的失效概率，然后整合认知不确定性的实现概率

Result: 三个示例表明，该方法在保持计算效率的同时，比忽略模型不确定性的传统方法产生更可信的预测结果

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理机器学习代理模型中的不确定性耦合问题，为可靠性分析提供更准确的预测

Abstract: Machine learning surrogates are increasingly employed to replace expensive
computational models for physics-based reliability analysis. However, their use
introduces epistemic uncertainty from model approximation errors, which couples
with aleatory uncertainty in model inputs, potentially compromising the
accuracy of reliability predictions. This study proposes a Gauss-Hermite
quadrature approach to decouple these nested uncertainties and enable more
accurate reliability analysis. The method evaluates conditional failure
probabilities under aleatory uncertainty using First and Second Order
Reliability Methods and then integrates these probabilities across realizations
of epistemic uncertainty. Three examples demonstrate that the proposed approach
maintains computational efficiency while yielding more trustworthy predictions
than traditional methods that ignore model uncertainty.

Result: 实验结果表明，与LSTM、GRU以及STL-LSTM组合模型相比，STL-GRU模型在工作日（除周五外）、周五和休息日的预测精度均有显著提升，MAPE分别降低了至少2.3、1.36和6.42个百分点。

Conclusion: STL-GRU组合预测模型能够有效提高地铁换乘客流预测的准确性，为地铁智能运营决策提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: In the metro intelligent transportation system, accurate transfer passenger
flow prediction is a key link in optimizing operation plans and improving
transportation efficiency. To further improve the theory of metro internal
transfer passenger flow prediction and provide more reliable support for
intelligent operation decisions, this paper innovatively proposes a metro
transfer passenger flow prediction model that integrates the Seasonal and Trend
decomposition using Loess (STL) method and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).In
practical application, the model first relies on the deep learning library
Keras to complete the construction and training of the GRU model, laying the
foundation for subsequent prediction; then preprocesses the original metro card
swiping data, uses the graph-based depth-first search algorithm to identify
passengers' travel paths, and further constructs the transfer passenger flow
time series; subsequently adopts the STL time series decomposition algorithm to
decompose the constructed transfer passenger flow time series into trend
component, periodic component and residual component, and uses the 3{\sigma}
principle to eliminate and fill the outliers in the residual component, and
finally completes the transfer passenger flow prediction.Taking the transfer
passenger flow data of a certain metro station as the research sample, the
validity of the model is verified. The results show that compared with Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the combined model of
STL time series decomposition method and Long Short-Term Memory (STL-LSTM), the
STL-GRU combined prediction model significantly improves the prediction
accuracy of transfer passenger flow on weekdays (excluding Fridays), Fridays
and rest days, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the prediction
results reduced by at least 2.3, 1.36 and 6.42 percentage points respectively.

TL;DR: 论文显示，基于Transformer的机器学习应用在解决物理问题时，其权重矩阵呈现随机性特征，与物理问题的数学结构无直接关联，表明机器学习与科学方法可能是两种互补的知识获取途径，但严格的解释性难以实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨机器学习（特别是Transformer模型）在解决物理问题时的权重特征，以及这些特征与物理问题数学结构之间的关系，旨在理解机器学习与科学方法在知识获取上的差异与互补性。

Method: 方法是通过分析Transformer模型在解决两个代表性物理应用中的权重矩阵，观察其随机性特征，并与物理问题的数学结构进行对比。

Result: 结果显示，权重矩阵呈现随机性，与物理问题的数学结构无直接可识别关联，表明机器学习可能通过不同于科学方法的路径获取知识。

Conclusion: 结论是机器学习与科学方法可能是互补的知识获取途径，但严格的解释性（如网络参数与物理结构的直接对应）难以实现，并警示在缺乏洞察力的情况下获取知识的风险。

Abstract: It is shown that the weight matrices of transformer-based machine learning
applications to the solution of two representative physical applications show a
random-like character which bears no directly recognizable link to the physical
and mathematical structure of the physical problem under study. This suggests
that machine learning and the scientific method may represent two distinct and
potentially complementary paths to knowledge, even though a strict notion of
explainability in terms of direct correspondence between network parameters and
physical structures may remain out of reach. It is also observed that drawing a
parallel between transformer operation and (generalized) path-integration
techniques may account for the random-like nature of the weights, but still
does not resolve the tension with explainability. We conclude with some general
comments on the hazards of gleaning knowledge without the benefit of Insight.

TL;DR: MoE-CL是一个参数高效的对抗性专家混合框架，用于工业规模的大语言模型持续指令调优，通过双专家设计和对抗学习来解决灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实工业环境中，大语言模型需要持续学习以适应多样化和不断变化的任务，但现有的持续学习方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，即训练新任务会降低对早期任务的性能。

Method: MoE-CL采用双专家设计：每个任务专用的LoRA专家通过参数独立性保留任务特定知识，共享LoRA专家实现跨任务迁移。通过集成任务感知判别器的GAN对抗学习，确保共享专家只传递任务相关信息。

Result: 在公开MTL5基准和工业Tencent3基准上的实验验证了MoE-CL的有效性。在腾讯视频平台的内容合规审查A/B测试中，MoE-CL将人工审核成本降低了15.3%。

Conclusion: MoE-CL在大规模工业部署中具有实用性，能够实现持续适应和稳定迁移，支持大语言模型的自进化。

Abstract: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn
continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring
self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However,
existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter
isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks
degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and
weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial
mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual
instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated
LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter
independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable
cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the
shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The
discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned
information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the
shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the
discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing
knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting
self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an
industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for
continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance
review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by
15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale
industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are
critical.

Motivation: 梯度跟踪技术虽然能提高分布式优化的收敛速度，但存在固有的隐私泄露风险，需要保护智能体在优化过程中的私有信息免受潜在攻击者的侵害。

Method: 提出加权梯度跟踪分布式隐私保护算法，通过衰减权重因子消除梯度跟踪中的隐私泄露风险，并在时变异构步长条件下分析算法收敛性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the privacy-preserving distributed optimization
problem, aiming to protect agents' private information from potential attackers
during the optimization process. Gradient tracking, an advanced technique for
improving the convergence rate in distributed optimization, has been applied to
most first-order algorithms in recent years. We first reveal the inherent
privacy leakage risk associated with gradient tracking. Building upon this
insight, we propose a weighted gradient tracking distributed privacy-preserving
algorithm, eliminating the privacy leakage risk in gradient tracking using
decaying weight factors. Then, we characterize the convergence of the proposed
algorithm under time-varying heterogeneous step sizes. We prove the proposed
algorithm converges precisely to the optimal solution under mild assumptions.
Finally, numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness through a
classical distributed estimation problem and the distributed training of a
convolutional neural network.

Motivation: 多元时间序列预测中，序列间的相关性对于准确性至关重要，但这些关系在不同时间尺度上表现出复杂的动态特性。现有方法在建模多尺度依赖关系和捕捉其复杂演化特性方面存在局限。

Method: SDGF模型采用双路径图结构学习方法：使用基于先验知识的静态图锚定长期稳定依赖关系，同时利用多级小波分解提取多尺度特征构建自适应学习的动态图。设计了注意力门控模块智能融合这两种互补信息，并使用多核扩张卷积网络加深对时序模式的理解。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的真实世界基准数据集上的综合实验证明了所提出模型的有效性。

Conclusion: SDGF模型通过静态-动态图融合机制成功捕捉了多尺度序列间相关性，为多元时间序列预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Inter-series correlations are crucial for accurate multivariate time series
forecasting, yet these relationships often exhibit complex dynamics across
different temporal scales. Existing methods are limited in modeling these
multi-scale dependencies and struggle to capture their intricate and evolving
nature. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Static-Dynamic
Graph Fusion network (SDGF), whose core lies in capturing multi-scale
inter-series correlations through a dual-path graph structure learning
approach. Specifically, the model utilizes a static graph based on prior
knowledge to anchor long-term, stable dependencies, while concurrently
employing Multi-level Wavelet Decomposition to extract multi-scale features for
constructing an adaptively learned dynamic graph to capture associations at
different scales. We design an attention-gated module to fuse these two
complementary sources of information intelligently, and a multi-kernel dilated
convolutional network is then used to deepen the understanding of temporal
patterns. Comprehensive experiments on multiple widely used real-world
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various

LLMs and an exploration of potential future trends. We then analyze how various
structural choices impact performance across benchmarks and further corroborate
our findings using mechanistic interpretability techniques. By providing
data-driven insights into LLM optimization, our work aims to guide the targeted

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为LoRALib的统一基准，用于标准化和比较不同的LoRA-MoE方法，通过大规模实验发现LoRAMoE性能最佳，且优先选择与目标任务相关的LoRA模块能进一步提升MoE性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA-MoE方法在模型、数据集、超参数和评估方法上缺乏统一标准，难以进行公平比较。

Method: 将40个下游任务的数据集标准化为统一格式，使用相同超参数微调获得680个LoRA模块，基于此LoRA库对3种代表性LoRA-MoE方法和不同LoRA选择机制进行大规模实验。

Result: 大量实验表明LoRAMoE表现最佳，优先选择与目标任务相关的LoRA模块能进一步提升MoE性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现将为未来工作提供启发，数据集和LoRA库已开源。

Abstract: As a parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) can save significant costs in storage and computing, but its strong
adaptability to a single task is often accompanied by insufficient cross-task
generalization capabilities. To improve this, existing work combines LoRA with
mixture-of-experts (MoE) to enhance the model's adaptability through expert
modules and routing mechanisms. However, existing LoRA-MoE methods lack unified
standards in models, datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation methods, making
it difficult to conduct fair comparisons between different methods. To this
end, we proposed a unified benchmark named LoRALib. Specifically, we
standardized datasets from $40$ downstream tasks into a unified format,
fine-tuned them using the same hyperparameters and obtained $680$ LoRA modules
across $17$ model architectures. Based on this LoRA library, we conduct
large-scale experiments on $3$ representative LoRA-MoE methods and different
LoRA selection mechanisms using the open-sourced testing tool OpenCompass.
Extensive experiments show that LoRAMoE performs best, and that prioritizing
LoRAs relevant to the target task can further improve the performance of MoE.
We hope these findings will inspire future work. Our datasets and LoRA library
are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/YaoLuzjut/LoRAOcean_dataset

Motivation: 现有的方法通常基于专家身份进行操作，而RIPLM旨在直接在秩诱导的Plackett-Luce参数化中进行更新，以保持算法生成的分布始终属于秩诱导分布类，从而维持与秩基准的等价性。

Method: RIPLM算法通过秩诱导的Plackett-Luce镜像下降方法，直接在秩诱导的Plackett-Luce参数化中进行更新，确保算法在每个回合中生成的分布始终属于秩诱导分布类。

Result: RIPLM是第一个在休眠专家设置中既保持秩忠实性又具有方差自适应性的算法。

Conclusion: RIPLM算法通过直接在秩诱导的Plackett-Luce参数化中进行更新，成功实现了在休眠专家设置中的秩忠实性和方差自适应性，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm, \emph{Rank-Induced Plackett--Luce Mirror
Descent (RIPLM)}, which leverages the structural equivalence between the
\emph{rank benchmark} and the \emph{distributional benchmark} established in
\citet{BergamOzcanHsu2022}. Unlike prior approaches that operate on expert
identities, RIPLM updates directly in the \emph{rank-induced Plackett--Luce
(PL)} parameterization. This ensures that the algorithm's played distributions
remain within the class of rank-induced distributions at every round,
preserving the equivalence with the rank benchmark. To our knowledge, RIPLM is
the first algorithm that is both (i) \emph{rank-faithful} and (ii)
\emph{variance-adaptive} in the sleeping experts setting.

TL;DR: 本文比较了基于规则的分类器FOLD-SE与FOLD-R++在二分类任务中的表现，以及FOLD-SE与XGBoost在多分类任务中的性能。研究发现FOLD-SE在保持可解释性的同时，性能损失很小，是平衡准确性和可解释性的可行方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对兼具准确性、效率和可解释性的机器学习模型需求增长，需要研究如何平衡准确性和可解释性之间的权衡。传统神经网络虽然准确率高但缺乏透明度，因此需要开发新的基于规则的算法。

Method: 使用FOLD-SE和FOLD-R++两种基于规则的分类器进行二分类比较，同时将FOLD-SE与XGBoost在多分类任务中进行对比。主要评估指标包括准确率、F1分数和处理时间。

Result: FOLD-SE在二分类中比FOLD-R++提供更少的规则，仅损失少量准确性和处理效率；在多分类中比XGBoost更精确高效，同时生成可理解的规则集。

Conclusion: FOLD-SE能够有效弥合可解释性和性能之间的差距，是各种分类任务中黑盒模型的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Recently, the demand for Machine Learning (ML) models that can balance
accuracy, efficiency, and interpreability has grown significantly.
Traditionally, there has been a tradeoff between accuracy and explainability in
predictive models, with models such as Neural Networks achieving high accuracy
on complex datasets while sacrificing internal transparency. As such, new
rule-based algorithms such as FOLD-SE have been developed that provide tangible
justification for predictions in the form of interpretable rule sets. The
primary objective of this study was to compare FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++, both
rule-based classifiers, in binary classification and evaluate how FOLD-SE
performs against XGBoost, a widely used ensemble classifier, when applied to
multi-category classification. We hypothesized that because FOLD-SE can
generate a condensed rule set in a more explainable manner, it would lose
upwards of an average of 3 percent in accuracy and F1 score when compared with
XGBoost and FOLD-R++ in multiclass and binary classification, respectively. The
research used data collections for classification, with accuracy, F1 scores,
and processing time as the primary performance measures. Outcomes show that
FOLD-SE is superior to FOLD-R++ in terms of binary classification by offering
fewer rules but losing a minor percentage of accuracy and efficiency in
processing time; in tasks that involve multi-category classifications, FOLD-SE
is more precise and far more efficient compared to XGBoost, in addition to
generating a comprehensible rule set. The results point out that FOLD-SE is a
better choice for both binary tasks and classifications with multiple
categories. Therefore, these results demonstrate that rule-based approaches
like FOLD-SE can bridge the gap between explainability and performance,
highlighting their potential as viable alternatives to black-box models in
diverse classification tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为代谢性疾病的早期检测和靶向干预提供了可解释且可扩展的解决方案，推动了精准医学的发展，特别适用于高风险人群的个性化治疗。

Abstract: Metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), represent
a significant global health burden, disproportionately impacting genetically
predisposed populations such as the Pima Indians (a Native American tribe from
south central Arizona). This study introduces a novel machine learning (ML)
framework that integrates predictive modeling with gene-agnostic pathway
mapping to identify high-risk individuals and uncover potential therapeutic
targets. Using the Pima Indian dataset, logistic regression and t-tests were
applied to identify key predictors of T2DM, yielding an overall model accuracy
of 78.43%. To bridge predictive analytics with biological relevance, we
developed a pathway mapping strategy that links identified predictors to
critical signaling networks, including insulin signaling, AMPK, and PPAR
pathways. This approach provides mechanistic insights without requiring direct
molecular data. Building upon these connections, we propose therapeutic
strategies such as dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, AMPK activators, SIRT1
modulators, and phytochemical, further validated through pathway enrichment
analyses. Overall, this framework advances precision medicine by offering
interpretable and scalable solutions for early detection and targeted
intervention in metabolic disorders. The key contributions of this work are:
(1) development of an ML framework combining logistic regression and principal
component analysis (PCA) for T2DM risk prediction; (2) introduction of a
gene-agnostic pathway mapping approach to generate mechanistic insights; and
(3) identification of novel therapeutic strategies tailored for high-risk
populations.

Abstract: Reconstructing individual patient data (IPD) from Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots
provides valuable insights for evidence synthesis in clinical research.
However, existing approaches often rely on manual digitization, which is
error-prone and lacks scalability. To address these limitations, we develop
KM-GPT, the first fully automated, AI-powered pipeline for reconstructing IPD
directly from KM plots with high accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility.
KM-GPT integrates advanced image preprocessing, multi-modal reasoning powered
by GPT-5, and iterative reconstruction algorithms to generate high-quality IPD
without manual input or intervention. Its hybrid reasoning architecture
automates the conversion of unstructured information into structured data flows
and validates data extraction from complex KM plots. To improve accessibility,
KM-GPT is equipped with a user-friendly web interface and an integrated AI
assistant, enabling researchers to reconstruct IPD without requiring
programming expertise. KM-GPT was rigorously evaluated on synthetic and
real-world datasets, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy. To
illustrate its utility, we applied KM-GPT to a meta-analysis of gastric cancer
immunotherapy trials, reconstructing IPD to facilitate evidence synthesis and
biomarker-based subgroup analyses. By automating traditionally manual processes
and providing a scalable, web-based solution, KM-GPT transforms clinical
research by leveraging reconstructed IPD to enable more informed downstream
analyses, supporting evidence-based decision-making.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data abounds in domain like traffic and environmental
monitoring. However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor
malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued
efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently
diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including
spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and
utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in
diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation
in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy
data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive
Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel
spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model.
Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model
for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional
information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We
also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated
attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms
existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation
error.

Motivation: 传统早期预警系统（如SOFA或MEWS）局限于单一结果预测，无法捕捉临床恶化的多维度特征。ICU患者常出现复杂、重叠的生理恶化迹象，需要及时升级护理。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据库中85,242例ICU住院数据，基于前24小时的生命体征汇总、实验室值和静态人口统计学特征，训练多标签分类模型预测24-72小时内发生的CETs。CETs通过基于规则的临床标准定义。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在不需复杂时间序列建模或自然语言处理的情况下，实现早期、可解释临床警报的实际潜力。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients often present with complex, overlapping
signs of physiological deterioration that require timely escalation of care.
Traditional early warning systems, such as SOFA or MEWS, are limited by their
focus on single outcomes and fail to capture the multi-dimensional nature of
clinical decline. This study proposes a multi-label classification framework to
predict Care Escalation Triggers (CETs), including respiratory failure,
hemodynamic instability, renal compromise, and neurological deterioration,
using the first 24 hours of ICU data. Using the MIMIC-IV database, CETs are
defined through rule-based criteria applied to data from hours 24 to 72 (for
example, oxygen saturation below 90, mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg,
creatinine increase greater than 0.3 mg/dL, or a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale
score greater than 2). Features are extracted from the first 24 hours and
include vital sign aggregates, laboratory values, and static demographics. We
train and evaluate multiple classification models on a cohort of 85,242 ICU
stays (80 percent training: 68,193; 20 percent testing: 17,049). Evaluation
metrics include per-label precision, recall, F1-score, and Hamming loss.
XGBoost, the best performing model, achieves F1-scores of 0.66 for respiratory,
0.72 for hemodynamic, 0.76 for renal, and 0.62 for neurologic deterioration,
outperforming baseline models. Feature analysis shows that clinically relevant
parameters such as respiratory rate, blood pressure, and creatinine are the
most influential predictors, consistent with the clinical definitions of the
CETs. The proposed framework demonstrates practical potential for early,
interpretable clinical alerts without requiring complex time-series modeling or
natural language processing.

*Xinyu Mu,Hui Dou,Furao Shen,Jian Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConceptFlow是一个基于概念的CNN可解释性框架，通过追踪概念在层间的传播来模拟模型的内部"思考路径"，包含概念注意力和概念路径两个关键组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了单个过滤器的语义角色和概念在层间的动态传播，需要更结构化的模型内部推理视图。

Method: 提出ConceptFlow框架，包括：(i)概念注意力-将每个过滤器与相关高级概念关联；(ii)概念路径-通过概念转移矩阵量化概念在过滤器间的传播和转换。

Result: 实验结果表明ConceptFlow能产生语义上有意义的模型推理洞察，验证了概念注意力和概念路径在解释决策行为方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过建模层次化概念路径，ConceptFlow提供了对CNN内部逻辑的更深层理解，支持生成更忠实和人类对齐的解释。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretability for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aims
to align internal model representations with high-level semantic concepts, but
existing approaches largely overlook the semantic roles of individual filters
and the dynamic propagation of concepts across layers. To address these
limitations, we propose ConceptFlow, a concept-based interpretability framework
that simulates the internal "thinking path" of a model by tracing how concepts
emerge and evolve across layers. ConceptFlow comprises two key components: (i)
concept attentions, which associate each filter with relevant high-level
concepts to enable localized semantic interpretation, and (ii) conceptual
pathways, derived from a concept transition matrix that quantifies how concepts
propagate and transform between filters. Together, these components offer a
unified and structured view of internal model reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that ConceptFlow yields semantically meaningful insights into model
reasoning, validating the effectiveness of concept attentions and conceptual
pathways in explaining decision behavior. By modeling hierarchical conceptual
pathways, ConceptFlow provides deeper insight into the internal logic of CNNs
and supports the generation of more faithful and human-aligned explanations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏表示的训练高效框架STS，通过视觉令牌压缩器和层动态跳过器来提升多模态大语言模型的训练效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型训练效率低下，主要由于多模态数据引入的长输入序列和层间计算利用率低

Method: STS框架包含两个关键组件：视觉令牌压缩器（减少视觉令牌信息负载）和层动态跳过器（在前后向传播中动态跳过语言模型的不必要层）

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中广泛评估，证明了其有效性和效率

Conclusion: 该稀疏训练方案适用于多种MLLM架构，能够显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance across a variety of domains. However, training MLLMs is often
inefficient due to the significantly longer input sequences introduced by
multimodal data and the low utilization of inter-layer computations. To address
this challenge, we shift the focus to the training process itself and propose a
novel training-efficient framework based on sparse representations, termed the
Sparse Training Scheme (STS). This scheme consists of two key components: the
Visual Token Compressor, which reduces the information load by compressing
visual tokens, and the Layer Dynamic Skipper, which mitigates the computational
overhead by dynamically skipping unnecessary layers in the language model
during both forward and backward passes. Our approach is broadly applicable to
diverse MLLM architectures and has been extensively evaluated on multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经架构搜索中耗时性能评估的问题，现有神经预测器由于难以捕捉架构间复杂关系而泛化能力差

Method: 包含全局编码方案（捕捉宏观结构信息）和共享超网络（增强架构间模式研究），使用动态自适应多任务损失确保训练稳定性

Result: 在5个代表性搜索空间（包括ViTs）上取得优异结果，CIFAR-10上97.60% top-1准确率，ImageNet上82.4% top-1准确率，样本使用量减少至少5倍

Conclusion: HyperNAS在少样本场景下表现出显著优势，为神经架构搜索提供了高效的性能预测解决方案

Abstract: Time-intensive performance evaluations significantly impede progress in
Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To address this, neural predictors leverage
surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance
predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor
generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships
among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural
predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS
consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared
hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the
comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves
as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture
patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive
multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front.
Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs,
demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For
instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1
accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least
5.0$\times$ fewer samples.

TL;DR: WLFM是一个用于测井解释的基础模型，通过三阶段训练（标记化、自监督预训练、多任务适应）在1200口井的多曲线测井数据上预训练，在孔隙度估计和岩性分类任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测井解释对于地下表征至关重要，但面临工具响应异质性、噪声信号和标签有限等挑战。

Method: WLFM采用三阶段方法：1）将测井片段标记化为地质标记；2）使用掩码标记建模和地层感知对比学习进行自监督预训练；3）通过少样本微调进行多任务适应。

Result: WLFM在孔隙度估计上达到0.0041 MSE，岩性分类准确率74.13%；微调后进一步提升至0.0038 MSE和78.10%准确率。模型表现出层感知能力，学习可重用的地质词汇表。

Conclusion: WLFM为地质AI提供了一个可扩展、可解释和可迁移的骨干网络，具有整合测井、地震和文本数据的潜力。

Abstract: Well-log interpretation is fundamental for subsurface characterization but
remains challenged by heterogeneous tool responses, noisy signals, and limited
labels. We propose WLFM, a foundation model pretrained on multi-curve logs from
1200 wells, comprising three stages: tokenization of log patches into
geological tokens, self-supervised pretraining with masked-token modeling and
stratigraphy-aware contrastive learning, and multi-task adaptation with
few-shot fine-tuning. WLFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving 0.0041 MSE in porosity estimation and 74.13\% accuracy in lithology
classification, while WLFM-Finetune further improves to 0.0038 MSE and 78.10\%
accuracy. Beyond predictive accuracy, WLFM exhibits emergent layer-awareness,
learns a reusable geological vocabulary, and reconstructs masked curves with
reasonable fidelity, though systematic offsets are observed in shallow and
ultra-deep intervals. Although boundary detection is not explicitly evaluated
here, clustering analyses suggest strong potential for future extension. These
results establish WLFM as a scalable, interpretable, and transferable backbone
for geological AI, with implications for multi-modal integration of logs,
seismic, and textual data.

Conclusion: 该方法将生成、评分和多目标优化统一在单一流程中，能够快速产生多样、强效的候选物，为肽类抗生素提供了可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths
annually by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Here we
present ApexAmphion, a deep-learning framework for de novo design of
antibiotics that couples a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with
reinforcement learning. The model is first fine-tuned on curated peptide data
to capture antimicrobial sequence regularities, then optimised with proximal
policy optimization against a composite reward that combines predictions from a
learned minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classifier with differentiable
physicochemical objectives. In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed
low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit
rate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial
activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules
killed bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. By
unifying generation, scoring and multi-objective optimization with deep
reinforcement learning in a single pipeline, our approach rapidly produces
diverse, potent candidates, offering a scalable route to peptide antibiotics
and a platform for iterative steering toward potency and developability within
hours.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and

efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible
and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B
parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We
introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and
training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact
encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document
knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid
reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long

For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU
memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的激活函数（如ReLU、tanh、sigmoid）是经验验证的静态函数，但通过优化激活函数的形状，可以为神经元分配更优化的激活函数，从而训练出更参数高效和准确的模型。

Method: 使用参数化线性B样条激活函数，提出并比较9种训练方法来探索神经网络中的双重优化动态。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比传统ReLU模型，在FNN中实现了高达94%的误差率降低，在CNN中实现了51%的误差率降低。

Conclusion: 通过优化激活函数形状可以显著提高模型性能，但需要付出额外的开发、训练复杂度以及模型延迟的代价。

Abstract: Activation functions in neural networks are typically selected from a set of
empirically validated, commonly used static functions such as ReLU, tanh, or
sigmoid. However, by optimizing the shapes of a network's activation functions,
we can train models that are more parameter-efficient and accurate by assigning
more optimal activations to the neurons. In this paper, I present and compare 9
training methodologies to explore dual-optimization dynamics in neural networks
with parameterized linear B-spline activation functions. The experiments
realize up to 94% lower end model error rates in FNNs and 51% lower rates in
CNNs compared to traditional ReLU-based models. These gains come at the cost of
additional development and training complexity as well as end model latency.

TL;DR: 本文研究最后一公里配送问题，结合卡车和无人机进行配送，并考虑电池管理约束。提出了一种混合强化学习方法，将ALNS卡车路径规划与基于注意力机制的无人机调度策略相结合，在50个节点的实例上取得了比传统方法更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决最后一公里配送中卡车和无人机协同工作的优化问题，特别是在考虑无人机电池续航、充电时间等实际约束条件下，如何最小化总完成时间。

Method: 采用混合强化学习方法：使用ALNS算法规划卡车路径（包含2/3-opt和Or-opt优化），同时使用基于指针/注意力机制的小型策略来调度无人机任务。策略通过硬可行性掩码确保无人机续航和充电约束，并使用精确的时间线模拟器计算真实的总完成时间。

Result: 在N=50个节点的欧几里得实例上，该方法平均完成时间为5.203±0.093，相比ALNS的5.349±0.038和NN的5.208±0.124，平均比ALNS提升2.73%，与NN相差仅0.10%。学习到的调度器在平衡卡车等待时间和无人机飞行时间方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的混合强化学习方法在卡车-无人机协同配送问题上表现优于传统启发式算法，能够有效平衡各种约束条件并最小化总完成时间。方法提供了可配置的实现和可视化工具，支持结果复现。

Abstract: We study last-mile delivery with one truck and one drone under explicit
battery management: the drone flies at twice the truck speed; each sortie must
satisfy an endurance budget; after every delivery the drone recharges on the
truck before the next launch. We introduce a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL)
solver that couples an ALNS-based truck tour (with 2/3-opt and Or-opt) with a
small pointer/attention policy that schedules drone sorties. The policy decodes
launch--serve--rendezvous triplets with hard feasibility masks for endurance
and post-delivery recharge; a fast, exact timeline simulator enforces
launch/recovery handling and computes the true makespan used by masked
greedy/beam decoding. On Euclidean instances with $N{=}50$, $E{=}0.7$, and
$R{=}0.1$, the method achieves an average makespan of \textbf{5.203}$\pm$0.093,
versus \textbf{5.349}$\pm$0.038 for ALNS and \textbf{5.208}$\pm$0.124 for NN --
i.e., \textbf{2.73\%} better than ALNS on average and within \textbf{0.10\%} of
NN. Per-seed, the RL scheduler never underperforms ALNS on the same instance
and ties or beats NN on two of three seeds. A decomposition of the makespan
shows the expected truck--wait trade-off across heuristics; the learned
scheduler balances both to minimize the total completion time. We provide a
config-first implementation with plotting and significance-test utilities to
support replication.

Conclusion: 这种掩码方法为未来学习特定模式提供了思路，可轻松高效地与其他训练方法结合并应用于各种扩散大语言模型。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a new architecture
following auto regressive models. Their denoising process offers a powerful
generative advantage, but they present significant challenges in learning and
understanding numerically sensitive mathematical and order-sensitive logical
tasks. Current training methods, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and
reinforcement learning, focus primarily on improving general knowledge
retention and reasoning abilities, but lack a comprehensive understanding of
mathematical and logical patterns. We propose DSFT, a simple yet effective
Diffusion SFT strategy, by adjusting the masking strategy and loss function,
guiding models to understand mathematical and logical patterns. This strategy
can be flexibly combined with pre-training, reinforcement learning, and other
training methods. Validated on models such as LLaDA and Dream series, we prove
that DSFT on small-scale data can achieve improvements of 5-10% and
approximately 2% on mathematical and logical problems, respectively. This
inspiring masking approach offers insights for future learning of specific
patterns, which can be easily and efficiently combined with other training
methods and applied to various dLLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile communication technologies, future
mobile networks will offer vast services and resources for commuting,
production, daily life, and entertainment. Accurate and efficient forecasting
of mobile data (e.g., cell traffic, user behavior, channel quality) helps
operators monitor network state changes, orchestrate wireless resources, and
schedule infrastructure and users, thereby improving supply efficiency and
service quality. However, current forecasting paradigms rely on customized
designs with tailored models for exclusive data types. Such approaches increase
complexity and deployment costs under large-scale, heterogeneous networks
involving base stations, users, and channels. In this paper, we design a
foundation model for mobile data forecasting, MobiGPT, with a unified structure
capable of forecasting three data types: base station traffic, user app usage,
and channel quality. We propose a soft-prompt learning method to help the model
understand features of different data types, and introduce a temporal masking
mechanism to guide the model through three forecasting tasks: short-term
prediction, long-term prediction, and distribution generation, supporting
diverse optimization scenarios. Evaluations on real-world datasets with over
100,000 samples show that MobiGPT achieves accurate multi-type forecasting.
Compared to existing models, it improves forecasting accuracy by 27.37%,
20.08%, and 7.27%, reflecting strong generalization. Moreover, MobiGPT exhibits
superior zero/few-shot performance in unseen scenarios, with over 21.51%
improvement, validating its strong transferability as a foundation model.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型无法将高精度数值计算作为内在可解释能力集成，而多智能体方法存在通信开销大、多模态能力效率低和可扩展性有限的问题。

Method: 提出PiMoE架构，通过分别训练专家、文本到计算模块和路由器，在推理时路由器在token级别指导计算和推理，实现单链思维中的迭代交替。

Result: 在两个推理-计算任务上的评估显示，PiMoE不仅比直接微调LLM精度更高，而且在响应延迟、token使用和GPU能耗方面相比主流多智能体方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: PiMoE为下一代科学或工业智能系统提供了高效、可解释和可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Complex systems typically rely on high-precision numerical computation to
support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot yet
incorporate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with
existing architectures. Mainstream multi-agent approaches can leverage external
experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from
inefficient multimodal emergent capability and limited scalability. To this
end, we propose PiMoE (Physically-isolated Mixture of Experts), a training and
inference architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of
the workflow paradigm of tool invocation, PiMoE endogenously integrates
computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training
experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router
directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling
iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiMoE on
two reasoning-computation tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent
system approaches. Results show that the PiMoE architecture achieves not only
higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements
in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with
mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiMoE offers an efficient, interpretable,
and scalable paradigm for next-generation scientific or industrial intelligent
systems.

TL;DR: FedIA框架通过投影优先策略解决联邦图学习中域偏移导致的梯度噪声问题，在聚合前对客户端更新进行去噪，实现更稳定高效的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习在域偏移场景下（如Twitch Gamers和多语言Wikipedia网络）会导致客户端模型表示不兼容，传统聚合方法不稳定且效果差。研究发现问题根源是梯度信号中的噪声，而非权重分配方案。

Method: 提出FedIA框架，采用投影优先策略：1）服务端top-ρ掩码保留约5%最具信息量的梯度坐标；2）轻量级影响力正则化动量权重抑制异常客户端。该框架无需额外上行流量，服务器内存开销可忽略。

Result: 在同构（Twitch Gamers）和异构（Wikipedia）图数据上，FedIA相比9个强基线方法实现了更平滑稳定的收敛和更高的最终准确率。收敛分析表明动态投影保持了最优的O(σ²/√T)收敛速率。

Conclusion: FedIA通过重要性感知的投影优先策略有效解决了联邦图学习中的域偏移问题，提供了一种高效可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) under domain skew -- as observed on platforms
such as \emph{Twitch Gamers} and multilingual \emph{Wikipedia} networks --
drives client models toward incompatible representations, rendering naive
aggregation both unstable and ineffective. We find that the culprit is not the
weighting scheme but the \emph{noisy gradient signal}: empirical analysis of
baseline methods suggests that a vast majority of gradient dimensions can be
dominated by domain-specific variance. We therefore shift focus from
"aggregation-first" to a \emph{projection-first} strategy that denoises client
updates \emph{before} they are combined. The proposed FedIA framework realises
this \underline{I}mportance-\underline{A}ware idea through a two-stage,
plug-and-play pipeline: (i) a server-side top-$\rho$ mask keeps only the most
informative about 5% of coordinates, and (ii) a lightweight
influence-regularised momentum weight suppresses outlier clients. FedIA adds
\emph{no extra uplink traffic and only negligible server memory}, making it
readily deployable. On both homogeneous (Twitch Gamers) and heterogeneous
(Wikipedia) graphs, it yields smoother, more stable convergence and higher
final accuracy than nine strong baselines. A convergence sketch further shows
that dynamic projection maintains the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ rate.

Motivation: 现有PTQ方法存在局限性：RTN方法无法处理LLM权重的高斯分布特性，码本方法虽然考虑了分布但存在内存访问模式问题导致推理速度下降。

Method: 提出SBVR方法，将权重值映射到非均匀表示点，其分布遵循LLM权重的实际高斯分布；设计定制CUDA内核，支持在SBVR格式下直接进行矩阵向量乘法而无需解压缩。

Result: 在各种模型上的评估显示，SBVR在4位量化下实现了最先进的困惑度和准确度基准性能，相比朴素FP16模型获得2.21-3.04倍的端到端token生成加速。

Conclusion: SBVR方法成功克服了现有量化方法的局限性，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了推理速度，为大语言模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous Post-Training
Quantization (PTQ) strategies have been proposed to alleviate deployment
barriers created by their enormous parameter counts. Quantization achieves
compression by limiting the number of representable points in the data.
Therefore, the key to achieving efficient quantization is selecting the optimal
combination of representation points, or codes, for the given data. Existing
PTQ solutions adopt two major approaches to this problem: Round-To-Nearest
(RTN)-based methods and codebook-based methods. RTN-based methods map LLM
weights onto uniformly distributed integer grids, failing to account for the
Gaussian-like weight distribution of LLM weights. Codebook-based methods
mitigate this issue by constructing distribution-aware codebooks; however, they
suffer from random and strided memory access patterns, resulting in degraded
inference speed that is exacerbated by the limited size of GPU L1 cache. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM quantization method, SBVR
(Summation of BitVector Representation), that enables Gaussian-like code
representation in a hardware-friendly manner for fast inference. SBVR maps
weight values to non-uniform representation points whose distribution follows
the actual distribution of LLM weights, enabling more accurate compression.
Additionally, we design a custom CUDA kernel that allows matrix-vector
multiplication directly in the SBVR format without decompression, thereby
enabling high-performance execution of SBVR-compressed models. Our evaluations
of SBVR on various models demonstrate state-of-the-art perplexity and accuracy
benchmark performance while delivering a 2.21x- 3.04x end-to-end
token-generation speedup over naive FP16 models in the 4-bit quantization
regime.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个大规模基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在地理空间路线认知方面的能力，发现LLMs在路线反转任务中存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够通过自然语言理解地理空间信息，但大语言模型的地理空间认知能力尚未得到充分探索。先前研究受限于不可量化的指标、有限的评估数据集和不清晰的研究层次。

Method: 创建了包含全球12个大都市36000条路线的大规模评估数据集；开发了PathBuilder工具，用于自然语言指令与导航路线之间的双向转换；提出了新的评估框架和指标来评估11个SOTA LLMs的路线反转能力。

Result: 基准测试显示LLMs在路线反转任务中存在明显局限：大多数反转路线既没有返回起点，也不接近最优路线。LLMs还面临路线生成鲁棒性低和对错误答案置信度高的问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在地理空间路线认知方面存在显著挑战，需要进一步改进模型的地理空间理解能力。该研究为评估和提升LLMs的地理空间认知提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while
the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by
non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research
hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a
large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises
worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural
language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap
between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new
evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art
(SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs
exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the
starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face
challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for
their incorrect answers. Code\ \&\ Data available here:

*Yu Ti Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态思维链（MCoT）框架，用于解决对话式导航中的自我中心到非自我中心的空间方向推理问题，在传统中文环境中实现了高精度的方向识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内或复杂设施中GPS信号弱、详细地图不可用时，对话代理需要将自我中心表达（如"在我右边"）转换为非自我中心方向（东南西北）的挑战。

Method: 提出多模态思维链框架，整合ASR转录语音和地标坐标，通过三步推理过程：提取空间关系、坐标映射到绝对方向、推断用户朝向，并在Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat模型上采用课程学习策略。

Result: MCoT在干净转录本上达到100%方向准确率，在ASR转录本上达到98.1%，显著优于单模态和非结构化基线，且在噪声对话条件下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结构化MCoT空间推理为可解释且资源高效的具身导航提供了一条可行路径，在多语言代码切换和领域迁移等挑战下保持高准确性。

Abstract: Conversational agents must translate egocentric utterances (e.g., "on my
right") into allocentric orientations (N/E/S/W). This challenge is particularly
critical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and
detailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has
advanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal
spatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational
Orientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese
conversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing
egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed
scenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which
integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a
structured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)
mapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.
A curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on
Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of
resource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%
orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,
substantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover,
MCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including
ASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also
maintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic
variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight
the potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward
interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.

Conclusion: 该方法为高效有效的任务向量组合建立了新标准，提高了变分框架的稳定性、可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Task vectors capture how a model changes during fine-tuning by recording the
difference between pre-trained and task-specific weights. The composition of
task vectors, a key operator in task arithmetic, enables models to integrate
knowledge from multiple tasks without incurring additional inference costs. In
this paper, we propose variational task vector composition, where composition
coefficients are taken as latent variables and estimated in a Bayesian
inference framework. Unlike previous methods that operate at the task level,
our framework focuses on sample-specific composition. Motivated by the
observation of structural redundancy in task vectors, we introduce a
Spike-and-Slab prior that promotes sparsity and preserves only the most
informative components. To further address the high variance and sampling
inefficiency in sparse, high-dimensional spaces, we develop a gated sampling
mechanism that constructs a controllable posterior by filtering the composition
coefficients based on both uncertainty and importance. This yields a more
stable and interpretable variational framework by deterministically selecting
reliable task components, reducing sampling variance while improving
transparency and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets by
selectively leveraging the most reliable and informative components in task
vectors. These findings highlight the practical value of our approach,
establishing a new standard for efficient and effective task vector
composition.

TL;DR: FastMTP是一种通过将多令牌预测训练与其推理模式对齐来提高多步草稿质量的方法，显著提升推测解码性能，实现LLM推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，自回归生成的顺序性造成了吞吐量瓶颈，限制了实际部署。多令牌预测在训练效率和性能方面表现出色，但其推理加速潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过位置共享权重在自蒸馏数据上微调单个MTP头，使其能够捕获连续未来令牌的依赖关系；集成语言感知动态词汇压缩到MTP头，减少草稿过程的计算开销。

Result: 在七个不同基准测试中，FastMTP相比标准下一个令牌预测实现了平均2.03倍加速，输出质量无损，性能优于普通MTP 82%。

Conclusion: FastMTP仅需轻量级训练，可无缝集成到现有推理框架中，为加速LLM推理提供了实用且快速部署的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, the sequential
nature of autoregressive generation creates a fundamental throughput bottleneck
that limits the practical deployment. While Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has
demonstrated remarkable benefits for model training efficiency and performance,
its inherent potential for inference acceleration remains largely unexplored.
This paper introduces FastMTP, a simple yet effective method that improves
multi-step draft quality by aligning MTP training with its inference pattern,
significantly enhancing speculative decoding performance. Our approach
fine-tunes a single MTP head with position-shared weights on self-distilled
data, enabling it to capture dependencies among consecutive future tokens and
maintain high acceptance rates across multiple recursive draft steps. By
integrating language-aware dynamic vocabulary compression into the MTP head, we
further reduce computational overhead in the drafting process. Experimental
results across seven diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FastMTP achieves an
average of 2.03x speedup compared to standard next token prediction with
lossless output quality, outperforming vanilla MTP by 82%. FastMTP requires
only lightweight training and seamlessly integrates with existing inference
frameworks, offering a practical and rapidly deployable solution for
accelerating LLM inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in distributed swarm learning (DSL) offer a promising
paradigm for edge Internet of Things. Such advancements enhance data privacy,
communication efficiency, energy saving, and model scalability. However, the
presence of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data pose
a significant challenge for multi-access edge computing, degrading learning
performance and diverging training behavior of vanilla DSL. Further, there
still lacks theoretical guidance on how data heterogeneity affects model
training accuracy, which requires thorough investigation. To fill the gap, this
paper first study the data heterogeneity by measuring the impact of non-i.i.d.
datasets under the DSL framework. This then motivates a new multi-worker
selection design for DSL, termed M-DSL algorithm, which works effectively with
distributed heterogeneous data. A new non-i.i.d. degree metric is introduced
and defined in this work to formulate the statistical difference among local
datasets, which builds a connection between the measure of data heterogeneity
and the evaluation of DSL performance. In this way, our M-DSL guides effective
selection of multiple works who make prominent contributions for global model
updates. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence behavior of
our M-DSL, followed by extensive experiments on different heterogeneous
datasets and non-i.i.d. data settings. Numerical results verify performance
improvement and network intelligence enhancement provided by our M-DSL beyond
the benchmarks.

Conclusion: GnnXemplar提供了一种有效的全局解释方法，能够处理大规模图数据中的复杂交互，并生成人类可理解的解释规则。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification, yet
their opaque decision-making limits trust and adoption. While local
explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation
methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped.
Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach
that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is
rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex
structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global
explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar
identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and
explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their
neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem
over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy
approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt
strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse
benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in
fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study
with 60 participants.

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据集上的实验表明，GETAD相比现有方法取得了持续改进，特别是在检测道路约束环境中的细微异常方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 将图结构和上下文语义纳入轨迹建模能够实现更精确和上下文感知的异常检测，证明了图增强方法在轨迹异常检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and
unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent
transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention.
  Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and
its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations,
with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level
abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space,
neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying
movement network, e.g., road or transit networks.
  The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework
tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical
travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network
to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and
transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings
that reflect the spatial layout of the road network.
  A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a
multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised
link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations.
  To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence
Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that
emphasizes high-confidence deviations.
  Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD
achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in
detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results
highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual
semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware
anomaly detection.

Motivation: 现代强化学习智能体通常通过更新网络参数来适应任务，但研究发现某些预训练后的智能体能够在参数固定的情况下，仅通过情境输入解决新的分布外任务。本文旨在解释为什么标准RL预训练算法能够产生支持这种情境强化学习能力的参数。

Method: 通过理论分析的方法，研究Transformer在策略评估预训练中的数学性质，证明预训练损失的全局最小值能够实现情境时序差分学习。

Result: 理论证明表明，当Transformer预训练用于策略评估时，确实存在能够支持情境时序差分学习的预训练损失全局最小值。

Conclusion: 研究为"支持情境强化学习的参数是预训练损失的最小值"这一假设提供了初步支持，揭示了预训练损失最小化与情境学习能力之间的理论联系。

Abstract: Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by
updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task.
Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of
new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on
some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making
parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional
input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new
task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context
increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically
called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network
enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the
pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this
paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network
parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL
are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for
this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a
Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers
of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.

Abstract: We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR)

addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss
of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces
complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with
rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction
from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our
reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains
both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving
competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while
providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates
feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete
sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for
interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery
are essential.

Conclusion: KANDI为解决医疗健康领域离线强化学习的关键挑战提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于老年人活动促进干预策略。

Abstract: Utilizing offline reinforcement learning (RL) with real-world clinical data
is getting increasing attention in AI for healthcare. However, implementation
poses significant challenges. Defining direct rewards is difficult, and inverse
RL (IRL) struggles to infer accurate reward functions from expert behavior in
complex environments. Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned
policies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address
challenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older
adults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we
introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function
approximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by
learning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults
(experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework
provide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline
RL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm
clinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study,
emphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to
promote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore
KANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare
applications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion
intervention strategies in healthcare.

Abstract: The simulation of complex physical systems using a discretized mesh is a
cornerstone of applied mechanics, but traditional numerical solvers are often
computationally prohibitive for many-query tasks. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their
standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued
by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce
MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs
with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of
challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional
elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in
long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial
computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful
and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate
the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种AI驱动的框架，用于为线性系统推荐MCMC预条件器参数，通过图神经网络预测预条件效果，并使用贝叶斯采集函数优化参数选择，相比传统方法节省50%搜索预算并减少10%收敛迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型稀疏线性系统在科学工程中普遍存在，Krylov子空间求解器是标准解法，但对于病态矩阵收敛缓慢，需要预条件器。MCMC矩阵求逆可生成预条件器，但其参数优化依赖手动或网格搜索，成本高昂。

Method: 使用图神经网络构建代理模型，从矩阵A和MCMC参数预测预条件加速效果；采用贝叶斯采集函数选择最可能最小化迭代次数的参数集。

Result: 在未见过的病态系统上，该框架用传统方法50%的搜索预算实现了更好的预条件效果，收敛迭代次数减少约10%。

Conclusion: 该研究为将MCMC预条件器集成到大规模系统提供了一条可行路径，展示了AI驱动参数优化的有效性。

Abstract: Large, sparse linear systems are pervasive in modern science and engineering,
and Krylov subspace solvers are an established means of solving them. Yet
convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments
usually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix
inversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations,
but its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices;
manual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending
MCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts
preconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition
function then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On
a previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better
preconditioning with 50\% of the search budget of conventional methods,
yielding about a 10\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results
suggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale
systems.

TL;DR: GluMind是一个基于Transformer的多模态框架，用于持续和长期血糖预测，通过交叉注意力和多尺度注意力机制整合生理和行为信号，并采用知识保留技术防止灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决血糖预测中不同采样率信号的整合挑战，以及长期时间依赖性的捕捉问题，同时应对持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 设计并行工作的交叉注意力和多尺度注意力机制，交叉注意力整合血糖数据与其他生理行为信号，多尺度注意力捕捉长期时间依赖性，并加入知识保留模块。

Result: 在AIREADI数据集上评估，GluMind在RMSE和MAE指标上分别比现有最优模型提升约15%和9%，表现出稳定的性能和适应性。

Conclusion: GluMind框架在持续血糖预测任务中表现出色，有效解决了多模态信号整合和长期依赖性建模的挑战。

Abstract: This paper proposes GluMind, a transformer-based multimodal framework
designed for continual and long-term blood glucose forecasting. GluMind devises
two attention mechanisms, including cross-attention and multi-scale attention,
which operate in parallel and deliver accurate predictive performance.
Cross-attention effectively integrates blood glucose data with other
physiological and behavioral signals such as activity, stress, and heart rate,
addressing challenges associated with varying sampling rates and their adverse
impacts on robust prediction. Moreover, the multi-scale attention mechanism
captures long-range temporal dependencies. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
GluMind incorporates a knowledge retention technique into the transformer-based
forecasting model. The knowledge retention module not only enhances the model's
ability to retain prior knowledge but also boosts its overall forecasting
performance. We evaluate GluMind on the recently released AIREADI dataset,
which contains behavioral and physiological data collected from healthy people,
individuals with prediabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes. We examine the
performance stability and adaptability of GluMind in learning continuously as
new patient cohorts are introduced. Experimental results show that GluMind
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting models, achieving
approximately 15% and 9% improvements in root mean squared error (RMSE) and
mean absolute error (MAE), respectively.

TL;DR: PGPCA是一种新的降维算法，将PPCA推广到非线性流形，通过结合几何坐标系统来更好地描述分布在非线性流形周围的数据分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PPCA及其扩展主要基于线性模型，只能描述欧几里得坐标系中的数据。但在神经科学等应用中，数据可能分布在非线性流形周围而非欧几里得空间中。

Method: 开发了PGPCA算法，明确结合从数据中拟合的非线性流形知识，推导出几何坐标系统来捕捉数据与流形的偏差和噪声，并提出了数据驱动的EM算法来学习模型参数。

Result: 在模拟和脑数据分析中，PGPCA能有效建模各种给定流形周围的数据分布，且在此类数据上优于PPCA。PGPCA还提供了测试几何坐标系统是否比欧几里得系统更好地描述数据的能力。

Conclusion: PGPCA通过结合非线性流形几何，增强了高维数据分析中降维的有效性，特别适用于具有噪声且分布在非线性流形周围的数据。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science
including neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a
prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic
approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection
between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its
extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in
a Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data
may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than
lying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal
Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction
algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear
manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition
to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be
derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold
and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA
model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data
distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations
and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data
distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data.
Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric
coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally,
PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both
around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for
enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of
high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear
manifold.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出离散时间扩散过程作为连续时间扩散模型的替代方案，解决了训练与推理条件不匹配的问题，并提出了多种噪声变体（加性高斯噪声、乘性高斯噪声、模糊噪声等）。实验表明离散时间过程在语音质量上可与连续模型相媲美，但具有更高效和一致的训练推理机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续时间扩散模型存在训练与推理条件不匹配的问题（连续训练但离散采样），且通常局限于加性高斯噪声。离散时间过程可以避免这些限制，减少推理步数，并保持训练/推理条件的一致性。

Method: 探索了扩散式的离散时间过程，提出了新的变体：加性高斯噪声、乘性高斯噪声、模糊噪声以及模糊与高斯噪声的混合。这些过程在离散时间框架下运行，确保训练和推理条件完全一致。

Result: 实验结果显示，离散时间过程在主观和客观语音质量评估中与流行的连续时间模型相当，同时提供了更高效和一致的训练与推理方案。

Conclusion: 离散时间扩散过程是连续时间扩散模型的有效替代方案，不仅保持了语音生成质量，还解决了连续模型的关键限制，实现了更优的训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These
models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient
training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising,
which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to
the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions.
Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not
have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and
are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores
some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants.
These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative
Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises.
The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable
subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous
counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维嵌入向量在表示非结构化数据和语义搜索中广泛应用，但其大尺寸导致存储和检索成本高昂，需要高效的压缩技术。

Method: 使用新型的简约且计算高效的非线性方法构建非均匀向量量化器，每个索引向量都单独学习其量化器。

Result: 实验结果显示NVQ在最小计算成本下相比现有技术具有更高的准确性。

Conclusion: NVQ在高保真度场景下提供了计算和空间效率优越的向量压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Embedding vectors are widely used for representing unstructured data and
searching through it for semantically similar items. However, the large size of
these vectors, due to their high-dimensionality, creates problems for modern
vector search techniques: retrieving large vectors from memory/storage is
expensive and their footprint is costly. In this work, we present NVQ
(non-uniform vector quantization), a new vector compression technique that is
computationally and spatially efficient in the high-fidelity regime. The core
in NVQ is to use novel parsimonious and computationally efficient
nonlinearities for building non-uniform vector quantizers. Critically, these
quantizers are \emph{individually} learned for each indexed vector. Our
experimental results show that NVQ exhibits improved accuracy compared to the
state of the art with a minimal computational cost.

TL;DR: SimpleFold是首个基于流匹配的蛋白质折叠模型，仅使用通用Transformer模块，挑战了传统依赖复杂领域特定架构的设计理念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统蛋白质折叠模型通常需要整合复杂的领域知识和专用架构模块，作者质疑这些设计是否必要，希望探索仅使用通用架构能否达到竞争性性能。

Method: 使用标准Transformer块配合自适应层，通过生成流匹配目标和额外结构项进行训练，模型规模达30亿参数，在约900万个蒸馏蛋白质结构和实验PDB数据上训练。

Result: 在标准折叠基准测试中，SimpleFold-3B达到与最先进基线竞争的性能，在集合预测方面表现优异，且在消费级硬件上部署和推理效率高。

Conclusion: SimpleFold挑战了蛋白质折叠中对复杂领域特定架构的依赖，为未来进展开辟了替代设计空间。

Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a
combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and
training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across
different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these
architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In
this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein
folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein
folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving
triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training
objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs
standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a
generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale
SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein
structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks,
SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble
prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic
reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold
shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware.
SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures
designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future
progress.

Motivation: 量子系统在高维希尔伯特空间中的演化使得传统数值方法计算成本高昂，现有神经网络架构需要大量训练数据且存在虚假振荡问题，影响物理可解释性。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov Arnold Networks（KANs）结合物理信息损失函数（强制执行Ehrenfest定理），并引入Chain of KANs架构直接嵌入时间因果性。

Result: 该方法仅需200个样本（传统Temporal Convolution Networks需要3,700个），准确率显著提升，仅需传统方法5.4%的训练数据。

Conclusion: 物理信息KANs相比传统黑盒模型具有明显优势，在保持数学严谨性和物理一致性的同时大幅降低数据需求，为量子动力学建模提供了有前景的新途径。

Abstract: The prediction of quantum dynamical responses lies at the heart of modern
physics. Yet, modeling these time-dependent behaviors remains a formidable
challenge because quantum systems evolve in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
often rendering traditional numerical methods computationally prohibitive.
While large language models have achieved remarkable success in sequential
prediction, quantum dynamics presents a fundamentally different challenge:
forecasting the entire temporal evolution of quantum systems rather than merely
the next element in a sequence. Existing neural architectures such as recurrent
and convolutional networks often require vast training datasets and suffer from
spurious oscillations that compromise physical interpretability. In this work,
we introduce a fundamentally new approach: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs)
augmented with physics-informed loss functions that enforce the Ehrenfest
theorems. Our method achieves superior accuracy with significantly less
training data: it requires only 5.4 percent of the samples (200) compared to
Temporal Convolution Networks (3,700). We further introduce the Chain of KANs,
a novel architecture that embeds temporal causality directly into the model
design, making it particularly well-suited for time series modeling. Our
results demonstrate that physics-informed KANs offer a compelling advantage
over conventional black-box models, maintaining both mathematical rigor and
physical consistency while dramatically reducing data requirements.

Motivation: 由于隐私和保密问题，金融机构缺乏用于训练AML模型的真实数据。虽然合成数据可以解决隐私问题，但纯合成数据集在训练AML模型时存在挑战。

Method: 提出使用混合数据集方法，将合成数据与公开可用的真实世界特征相结合，以增强数据集的实用性。

Result: 混合数据集不仅能够保护隐私，还能显著提高AML模型的效用，为金融机构提供实用的解决方案。

Conclusion: 混合数据集方法为金融机构增强AML系统提供了一条可行的途径，平衡了数据隐私和模型性能的需求。

Abstract: Money laundering is a critical global issue for financial institutions.
Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN),
can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for
developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy
and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the
statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality
has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely
synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes
the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by
incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features.
These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but
also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial
institutions to enhance AML systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APRIL是一种新的强化学习训练方法，通过主动部分rollout策略解决长尾响应分布导致的GPU空闲问题，提高训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL训练中，rollout生成占总运行时间的90%以上，且长尾响应分布导致GPU空闲和利用率低下，限制了模型的可扩展性。

Method: APRIL在rollout阶段超额配置请求，一旦达到目标响应数量就终止，并将未完成的响应回收用于后续步骤的继续生成。

Result: 实验显示APRIL将rollout吞吐量最多提升44%，加速收敛速度，并在多个任务上实现最多8%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: APRIL统一了系统级和算法级考虑，可提高RL训练效率，且与框架和硬件无关，已在slime RL框架中集成。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale
pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o
series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale
RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the
community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most
of these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation
and training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains
computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%
of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the
long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy
responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model
and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits
scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in
Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the
rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the
target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for
continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are
discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that
APRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL
algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8%
higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and
hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and
deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies
system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of
advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL
systems.

*Mingqian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为反向互补一致性正则化（RCCR）的简单且模型无关的微调目标，通过惩罚模型对DNA序列及其反向互补序列预测之间的差异，来提高DNA语言模型的对称性鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA序列的反向互补序列通常具有相同的生物学意义，但现有的DNA语言模型往往无法捕捉这种对称性，导致对序列及其反向互补序列的预测不一致，这降低了模型的可靠性。

Method: RCCR是一种微调目标，直接惩罚模型对序列预测与其反向互补序列对齐预测之间的差异。该方法在三个不同骨干网络（Nucleotide Transformer、HyenaDNA、DNABERT-2）上进行了评估，涵盖了序列分类、标量回归和轮廓预测等多种基因组任务。

Result: 实验表明，RCCR显著提高了反向互补鲁棒性，大幅减少了预测翻转和错误，同时与基线方法（如反向互补数据增强和测试时平均）相比，保持或提高了任务准确性。

Conclusion: 通过将关键的生物学先验直接整合到学习过程中，RCCR为不同的生物学任务提供了一种单一、内在鲁棒且计算高效的模型微调方法。

Abstract: A fundamental property of DNA is that the reverse complement (RC) of a
sequence often carries identical biological meaning. However, state-of-the-art
DNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing
inconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which
undermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement
Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning
objective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction
on a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate
RCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA,
DNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification,
scalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR
substantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips
and errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to
baselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating
a key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a
single, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning
recipe for diverse biology tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出Symphony-MoE框架，通过融合多个异构预训练模型的专家来构建高性能MoE模型，解决传统upcycling方法专家多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型通过复制单个预训练密集模型的FFN层来构建专家，但这种方法限制了专家多样性。本文旨在利用多个异构预训练模型来构建更具多样性的MoE模型。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）通过层感知融合策略构建共享骨干网络，并使用基于激活的功能对齐来缓解参数错位；2）进行轻量级路由器训练来协调整个架构。

Result: 实验表明，该方法成功整合了来自异构源的专家，在多领域任务和分布外泛化方面显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: Symphony-MoE框架能够有效整合异构预训练模型，构建出性能优越的MoE模型，为解决专家多样性问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable performance by activating
large parameter sets sparsely, minimizing computational overhead. To circumvent
the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs
upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its
feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert
diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This
paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using
experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained
models (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact
that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter
space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To
overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to
harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we
establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared
backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter
misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment.
Subsequently, a single lightweight stage of router training coordinates the
entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully
integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that
significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution
generalization.

Abstract: The meta-task of obtaining and aligning representations through contrastive
pretraining is steadily gaining importance since its introduction in CLIP and
ALIGN. In this paper we theoretically explain the advantages of synchronizing
with trainable inverse temperature and bias under the sigmoid loss, as
implemented in the recent SigLIP and SigLIP2 models of Google DeepMind.
Temperature and bias can drive the loss function to zero for a rich class of
configurations that we call $(\mathsf{m},
\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations. $(\mathsf{m},
\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations are a novel combinatorial object
related to spherical codes and are parametrized by a margin $\mathsf{m}$ and
relative bias $\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}}$. We use our characterization of
constellations to theoretically justify the success of SigLIP on retrieval, to
explain the modality gap present in SigLIP, and to identify the necessary
dimension for producing high-quality representations. Finally, we propose a
reparameterization of the sigmoid loss with explicit relative bias, which
improves training dynamics in experiments with synthetic data.

Abstract: Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multiple
etiologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal
dementia, and vascular dementia. Its clinical and biological heterogeneity
makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain
connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of
interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks
(XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based
learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant
biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent
insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review
dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and
multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for
dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models
in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited
generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open
problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically
meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.

Result: ITT在多孔材料的吸附、传输和稳定性性能预测方面达到了最先进的准确性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构和化学多样性多孔材料的学习引导发现提供了原则性和可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Porous materials exhibit vast structural diversity and support critical
applications in gas storage, separations, and catalysis. However, predictive
modeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property
relationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical
environments and global pore-network topology. These complexities, combined
with sparse and unevenly distributed labeled data, hinder generalization across
material families. We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a
unified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to
capture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels,
including structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization.
ITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and
relational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them
through a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning
across scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised
pretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised
fine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable
predictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties. This framework
provides a principled and scalable path for learning-guided discovery in
structurally and chemically diverse porous materials.

*Mingchun Sun,Rongqiang Zhao,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DS-Diffusion模型，解决现有时间序列生成扩散模型需要重新训练引入条件指导、生成数据与真实数据存在分布偏差以及推理过程不可解释的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在时间序列生成中存在三个主要问题：需要重新训练整个框架来引入特定条件指导；生成数据与真实数据存在分布偏差；扩散模型和潜在空间的复杂性导致推理过程不可解释。

Method: 提出了数据风格引导的扩散模型（DS-Diffusion），包括基于风格引导核的扩散框架来避免特定条件的重新训练，以及基于时间信息的分层去噪机制（THD）来减少分布偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明，与最先进的ImagenTime模型相比，预测分数和判别分数分别降低了5.56%和61.55%，生成数据与真实数据的分布偏差进一步减小，推理过程更加可解释。

Conclusion: DS-Diffusion模型通过消除重新训练扩散模型的需求，增强了模型对特定条件的灵活性和适应性，同时提高了生成质量、减少了分布偏差并改善了可解释性。

Abstract: Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation
tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require
retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance.
There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated
data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream
tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces
leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we
propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the
DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed
to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based
hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the
distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore,
the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they
originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets
to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the
state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the
discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The
distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further
reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by
eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and
adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.

TL;DR: REBACT方法通过在行动前增加反思步骤，显著提升LLM在交互决策任务中的性能，在多个环境中实现成功率的显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM决策方法存在错误累积问题且缺乏有效的自我纠正机制，需要一种能够即时纠错并适应环境反馈的方法

Method: 提出"Reflect before Act"(REBACT)方法，在采取下一个行动之前引入关键的反思步骤，实现即时错误纠正

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和TextCraft三个环境中，REBACT显著超越基线方法，成功率分别提升6.72%(达98.51%)、24%(达61%)和0.5%(达99.5%)

Conclusion: REBACT仅需少量修改步骤即可实现性能提升，证明了其计算效率，为LLM交互决策提供了有效的自我纠正机制

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interactive decision-making tasks, but existing methods often struggle with
error accumulation and lack robust self-correction mechanisms. We introduce
"Reflect before Act" (REBACT), a novel approach that enhances LLM-based
decision-making by introducing a critical reflect step prior to taking the next
action. This approach allows for immediate error correction, ensuring smooth
action path and adaptibity to environment feedback. We evaluate REBACT on three
diverse interactive environments: ALFWorld, WebShop, and TextCraft. Our results
demonstrate that REBACT significantly outperforms strong baselines, improving
success rates by up to 24% on WebShop (achieving 61%), 6.72% on ALFWorld
(achieving 98.51%), and 0.5% on TextCraft (achieving 99.5%) using
Claude3.5-sonnet as the underlying LLM. Further analysis reveals that REBACT's
performance improvements are achieved with only a few modification steps,
demonstrating its computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出Flow Marching算法，将神经算子学习与流匹配相结合，构建生成式PDE基础模型，通过联合采样噪声水平和物理时间步长，学习统一速度场以减少长期滚动漂移并实现不确定性感知的集合生成。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要依赖确定性Transformer架构，缺乏生成灵活性，无法满足科学和工程应用中对不确定性建模的需求。

Method: 提出Flow Marching算法、Physics-Pretrained VAE（P2VAE）和Flow Marching Transformer（FMT），构建生成式PDE基础模型，在12个PDE家族的250万条轨迹上进行大规模预训练。

Result: 模型在未见过的Kolmogorov湍流上表现出良好的少样本适应能力，长期滚动稳定性优于确定性模型，并能提供不确定性分层的集合结果，计算效率比完整视频扩散模型提高15倍。

Conclusion: 生成式PDE基础模型对于现实世界应用具有重要意义，能够提供不确定性感知的预测和更稳定的长期模拟。

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale collections of PDE-governed spatiotemporal
trajectories has recently shown promise for building generalizable models of
dynamical systems. Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on
deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for
many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an
algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by
an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a
generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise
level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a
unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean
successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling uncertainty-aware
ensemble generations. Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a
Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states
into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT)
that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids,
achieving up to 15x greater computational efficiency than full-length video
diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially
reduced cost. We curate a corpus of ~2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE
families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream
evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot
adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic
counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting
the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperAdapt是一种参数高效微调方法，通过行列缩放对角矩阵来适配预训练权重矩阵，仅需n+m个可训练参数就能实现高秩更新，显著减少参数数量同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在多样化任务上表现出色，但适应专业应用通常需要微调，这种方法内存和计算成本高。参数高效微调方法通过仅更新少量权重来缓解这个问题。

Method: HyperAdapt通过应用行列缩放对角矩阵来适配预训练权重矩阵，仅需n+m个可训练参数就能为n×m矩阵实现高秩更新。理论分析建立了更新秩的上界。

Result: 在GLUE、算术推理和常识推理基准测试中，使用高达140亿参数的模型进行实验，HyperAdapt匹配或接近完全微调和最先进PEFT方法的性能，同时使用数量级更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: HyperAdapt是一种高效的参数微调方法，能够在显著减少参数数量的情况下保持模型性能，为大规模模型的高效适配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models excel across diverse tasks, but adapting them to
specialized applications often requires fine-tuning, an approach that is memory
and compute-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate
this by updating only a small subset of weights. In this paper, we introduce
HyperAdapt, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that significantly reduces
the number of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods like
LoRA. Specifically, HyperAdapt adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by applying
row- and column-wise scaling through diagonal matrices, thereby inducing a
high-rank update while requiring only $n+m$ trainable parameters for an $n
\times m$ matrix. Theoretically, we establish an upper bound on the rank of
HyperAdapt's updates, and empirically, we confirm that it consistently induces
high-rank transformations across model layers. Experiments on GLUE, arithmetic
reasoning, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks with models up to 14B
parameters demonstrate that HyperAdapt matches or nearly matches the
performance of full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art PEFT methods while using
orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为子空间聚类的新框架，用于基于列空间对高矩阵集合进行聚类，通过块项分解构建三阶张量来联合估计聚类成员关系和部分共享子空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统子空间聚类方法假设向量化数据，但实际应用中数据样本通常以矩阵形式存在，需要直接对矩阵数据进行子空间聚类。

Method: 基于块项分解构建三阶张量，联合估计聚类成员关系和部分共享子空间，并提出了可扩展的优化算法。

Result: 在真实高光谱成像数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有子空间聚类技术具有更高的聚类准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在高噪声和干扰条件下。

Conclusion: 该框架在高维应用中具有重要潜力，能够有效处理超越单个数据向量的结构信息。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices
based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of
Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume
vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix
and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish
conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation
Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general
setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a
third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint
estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide
the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable
optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world
hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and
interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These
results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging
high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data
vectors.

chemistry often fail to generalize to agrochemicals, underscoring the need for
domain-specific models and benchmarks. Future work will focus on developing a
comprehensive benchmarking suite and designing ML models tailored to the unique
challenges of pesticide discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了广义双模拟度量（GBSM），用于衡量不同马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）之间的状态相似性，解决了传统BSM在多MDP场景下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统双模拟度量（BSM）在单个MDP内有效，但在多MDP场景（如策略迁移）中应用受限，缺乏对数学性质的严格分析限制了理论发展。

Method: 通过形式化定义GBSM，并严格证明其三个基本性质：对称性、MDP间三角不等式和相同状态空间上的距离界限。

Result: GBSM在策略迁移、状态聚合和基于采样的估计方面获得了比标准BSM更严格的理论界限，并提供了闭式样本复杂度估计。

Conclusion: GBSM为多MDP场景提供了理论基础，数值结果验证了其有效性，改进了现有基于BSM的渐近结果。

Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state
similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states
closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been
successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state
representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP
scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has
attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis
of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In
this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM)
between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental
properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance
bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically
analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in
MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived
from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample
complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on
BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to e-commerce payment fraud detection by
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). By
framing transaction risk as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP), RL
optimizes risk detection across multiple payment stages. Crafting effective
reward functions, essential for RL model success, typically requires
significant human expertise due to the complexity and variability in design.
LLMs, with their advanced reasoning and coding capabilities, are well-suited to
refine these functions, offering improvements over traditional methods. Our
approach leverages LLMs to iteratively enhance reward functions, achieving
better fraud detection accuracy and demonstrating zero-shot capability.
Experiments with real-world data confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and
resilience of our LLM-enhanced RL framework through long-term evaluations,
underscoring the potential of LLMs in advancing industrial RL applications.

Motivation: 传统CNN在处理具有周期性结构的数据时存在局限性，需要开发能够更好地处理高维内在维度脊结构问题的架构。

Method: 设计周期性CNN架构，在卷积层中引入周期性边界条件，并建立严格的近似定理来证明其表达能力。

Result: 理论证明周期性CNN能够近似d-1维脊函数，而低维脊设置无法实现这种近似，确立了周期性CNN表达能力的精确特征。

Conclusion: 周期性CNN不仅扩展了CNN近似理论的数学基础，还为图像分析、物理信息学习和材料科学等领域的实际问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel convolutional neural network architecture, termed the
\emph{periodic CNN}, which incorporates periodic boundary conditions into the
convolutional layers. Our main theoretical contribution is a rigorous
approximation theorem: periodic CNNs can approximate ridge functions depending
on $d-1$ linear variables in a $d$-dimensional input space, while such
approximation is impossible in lower-dimensional ridge settings ($d-2$ or fewer
variables). This result establishes a sharp characterization of the expressive
power of periodic CNNs. Beyond the theory, our findings suggest that periodic
CNNs are particularly well-suited for problems where data naturally admits a
ridge-like structure of high intrinsic dimension, such as image analysis on
wrapped domains, physics-informed learning, and materials science. The work
thus both expands the mathematical foundation of CNN approximation theory and
highlights a class of architectures with surprising and practically relevant
approximation capabilities.

Conclusion: MOMEMTO通过内存模块有效缓解了时间序列异常检测中的过度泛化问题，实现了多数据集联合训练的高效异常检测，为时间序列基础模型在异常检测任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time
series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability
increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen
anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by
incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns.
Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to
be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection,
enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The
memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from
multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across
multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes
memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes
them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We
evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on
AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the
performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.

Method: 通过理论分析和数值模拟，研究对角线性网络的完整训练轨迹。在lasso路径单调性假设下建立精确联系，在一般情况下展示近似联系。

Result: 研究发现对角线性网络的训练轨迹与lasso正则化路径密切相关，训练时间相当于逆正则化参数。在单调性条件下这种联系是精确的。

Conclusion: 对角线性网络的训练过程可以理解为沿着lasso正则化路径的演化，这为理解神经网络隐式正则化提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Diagonal linear networks are neural networks with linear activation and
diagonal weight matrices. Their theoretical interest is that their implicit
regularization can be rigorously analyzed: from a small initialization, the
training of diagonal linear networks converges to the linear predictor with
minimal 1-norm among minimizers of the training loss. In this paper, we deepen
this analysis showing that the full training trajectory of diagonal linear
networks is closely related to the lasso regularization path. In this
connection, the training time plays the role of an inverse regularization
parameter. Both rigorous results and simulations are provided to illustrate
this conclusion. Under a monotonicity assumption on the lasso regularization
path, the connection is exact while in the general case, we show an approximate
connection.

Motivation: 现有的图聚类方法（如谱聚类、对称非负矩阵分解等）为了数值可行性过度松弛了内在的约束条件，这可能限制了它们的聚类效果。

Method: 提出LoRD模型仅放松正交约束，并引入块对角正则化得到B-LoRD。通过引入类别概率参数将非凸的双随机约束转化为线性凸约束，并设计了全局收敛的投影梯度下降算法。

Result: 理论分析证明了正交性与块对角性在双随机约束下的等价性，以及模型的梯度Lipschitz连续性。大量实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LoRD和B-LoRD通过更合理的约束松弛策略和块对角正则化，显著提升了图聚类的性能，为相关领域提供了新的理论见解和实用工具。

Abstract: The well-known graph-based clustering methods, including spectral clustering,
symmetric non-negative matrix factorization, and doubly stochastic
normalization, can be viewed as relaxations of the kernel $k$-means approach.
However, we posit that these methods excessively relax their inherent low-rank,
nonnegative, doubly stochastic, and orthonormal constraints to ensure numerical
feasibility, potentially limiting their clustering efficacy. In this paper,
guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose \textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank
\textbf{D}oubly stochastic clustering (\textbf{LoRD}), a model that only
relaxes the orthonormal constraint to derive a probabilistic clustering
results. Furthermore, we theoretically establish the equivalence between
orthogonality and block diagonality under the doubly stochastic constraint. By
integrating \textbf{B}lock diagonal regularization into LoRD, expressed as the
maximization of the Frobenius norm, we propose \textbf{B-LoRD}, which further
enhances the clustering performance. To ensure numerical solvability, we
transform the non-convex doubly stochastic constraint into a linear convex
constraint through the introduction of a class probability parameter. We
further theoretically demonstrate the gradient Lipschitz continuity of our LoRD
and B-LoRD enables the proposal of a globally convergent projected gradient
descent algorithm for their optimization. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approaches. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Shared-Weights Extender和Steepest Voting Distributor方法，通过在训练过程中扩展神经网络来增加容量，同时防止新神经元变得不活跃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在训练过程中扩展神经网络是一种有前景的方法，可以在不从头训练更大模型的情况下增加容量。但新添加的神经元往往无法适应已训练的网络而变得不活跃，无法为容量增长做出贡献。

Method: 提出Shared-Weights Extender方法，通过将新神经元与现有神经元耦合来实现平滑集成；同时引入Steepest Voting Distributor，一种基于梯度的神经元分配方法，用于在深度网络扩展时跨层分配神经元。

Result: 在四个数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，该方法能有效抑制神经元不活跃现象，相比其他扩展方法和基线实现了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络扩展提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在不重新训练的情况下平滑地增加网络容量。

Abstract: Expanding neural networks during training is a promising way to augment
capacity without retraining larger models from scratch. However, newly added
neurons often fail to adjust to a trained network and become inactive,
providing no contribution to capacity growth. We propose the Shared-Weights
Extender (SWE), a novel method explicitly designed to prevent inactivity of new
neurons by coupling them with existing ones for smooth integration. In
parallel, we introduce the Steepest Voting Distributor (SVoD), a gradient-based
method for allocating neurons across layers during deep network expansion. Our
extensive benchmarking on four datasets shows that our method can effectively
suppress neuron inactivity and achieve better performance compared to other
expanding methods and baselines.

TL;DR: NGRPO算法解决了GRPO在处理同质错误响应时学习信号丢失的问题，通过优势校准和不对称裁剪机制，将同质错误转化为有效的学习信号，在数学推理任务上显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在处理全部正确或全部错误的同质响应组时存在严重缺陷，特别是对于全部错误的组，优势函数值为零导致梯度消失，丢失了宝贵的学习信号。

Method: NGRPO引入优势校准机制，在优势计算中假设存在虚拟最大奖励样本，改变组内奖励的均值和方差；同时采用不对称裁剪，放松正样本的更新幅度，严格约束负样本的更新幅度。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型上的实验表明，NGRPO在MATH500、AMC23和AIME2025等数学基准测试上显著优于PPO、GRPO、DAPO和PSR-NSR等基线方法。

Conclusion: NGRPO能够有效学习同质错误，实现数学推理能力的稳定和显著提升，验证了该算法在处理同质响应组问题上的有效性。

Abstract: RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
across various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers
from a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either
entirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these
homogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously
incorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero,
leading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To
overcome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy
Optimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust
learning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism
hypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage
calculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group
and ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no
longer zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the
update magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on
that of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure
introduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B
demonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO,
DAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and
AIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous
errors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical
reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/nangongrui-ngr/NGRPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次分析了异质性在图级学习中的影响，通过理论分析和实验验证发现，与节点级任务不同，图级任务（特别是基于motif的任务）需要混合频率动态而非频率主导机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然异质性在节点级任务中已被广泛研究，但其对图级任务的影响尚不清楚。本文旨在填补这一空白，建立图级学习中异质性的理论理解。

Method: 首先提出了图级标注方案的分类法，重点关注局部结构标注中的motif检测任务。使用基于能量的梯度流分析揭示理论洞察，并在合成数据集和真实分子属性预测数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明motif目标与全局频率主导机制存在固有错位，实验结果显示频率自适应模型优于频率主导模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了图级学习中异质性的新理论理解，并为设计有效的GNN架构提供了指导，强调需要频率自适应而非频率主导的方法。

Abstract: While heterophily has been widely studied in node-level tasks, its impact on
graph-level tasks remains unclear. We present the first analysis of heterophily
in graph-level learning, combining theoretical insights with empirical
validation. We first introduce a taxonomy of graph-level labeling schemes, and
focus on motif-based tasks within local structure labeling, which is a popular
labeling scheme. Using energy-based gradient flow analysis, we reveal a key
insight: unlike frequency-dominated regimes in node-level tasks, motif
detection requires mixed-frequency dynamics to remain flexible across multiple
spectral components. Our theory shows that motif objectives are inherently
misaligned with global frequency dominance, demanding distinct architectural
considerations. Experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled heterophily
and real-world molecular property prediction support our findings, showing that
frequency-adaptive model outperform frequency-dominated models. This work
establishes a new theoretical understanding of heterophily in graph-level
learning and offers guidance for designing effective GNN architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在联邦学习中通过动态优化后门触发器来解耦后门任务与主任务的方法，提高了后门攻击的持久性和抵抗防御的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的分布式特性暴露了新的攻击面，现有后门攻击依赖固定模式或对抗扰动作为触发器，导致后门任务与主任务紧密耦合，容易被诚实更新稀释且在联邦防御下持久性有限。

Method: 采用min-max框架动态优化后门触发器：内层最大化中毒样本与良性样本的性能差距，确保良性用户更新对后门影响最小；外层将自适应触发器注入本地模型。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言任务上的实验表明，该方法在六种防御算法下相比六种后门攻击方法具有更好的攻击性能，且易于集成到现有后门攻击技术中。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态优化触发器成功解耦了后门任务与主任务，显著提高了联邦学习环境下后门攻击的持久性和抵抗防御的能力。

Abstract: Federated learning allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a
central model without sharing their private data. However, this distributed
nature also exposes new attack surfaces. In particular, backdoor attacks allow
attackers to implant malicious behaviors into the global model while
maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. Existing attacks usually rely on
fixed patterns or adversarial perturbations as triggers, which tightly couple
the main and backdoor tasks. This coupling makes them vulnerable to dilution by
honest updates and limits their persistence under federated defenses. In this
work, we propose an approach to decouple the backdoor task from the main task
by dynamically optimizing the backdoor trigger within a min-max framework. The
inner layer maximizes the performance gap between poisoned and benign samples,
ensuring that the contributions of benign users have minimal impact on the
backdoor. The outer process injects the adaptive triggers into the local model.
We evaluate our method on both computer vision and natural language tasks, and
compare it with six backdoor attack methods under six defense algorithms.
Experimental results show that our method achieves good attack performance and
can be easily integrated into existing backdoor attack techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统NAR方法的局限性：无法构造有效解、难以处理多解问题、在NP难问题上表现不佳、以及无法应用于缺乏强算法的场景。

Method: 将算法轨迹学习问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出GNARL框架，结合模仿学习和强化学习技术，适用于广泛的图基问题。

Result: 在多个CLRS-30问题上获得高图精度，在NP难问题上性能匹配或超越更窄的NAR方法，且在没有专家算法的情况下仍可应用。

Conclusion: GNARL框架成功克服了NAR的关键限制，为算法学习提供了更通用和强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) is a paradigm that trains neural networks
to execute classic algorithms by supervised learning. Despite its successes,
important limitations remain: inability to construct valid solutions without
post-processing and to reason about multiple correct ones, poor performance on
combinatorial NP-hard problems, and inapplicability to problems for which
strong algorithms are not yet known. To address these limitations, we reframe
the problem of learning algorithm trajectories as a Markov Decision Process,
which imposes structure on the solution construction procedure and unlocks the
powerful tools of imitation and reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the
GNARL framework, encompassing the methodology to translate problem formulations
from NAR to RL and a learning architecture suitable for a wide range of
graph-based problems. We achieve very high graph accuracy results on several
CLRS-30 problems, performance matching or exceeding much narrower NAR
approaches for NP-hard problems and, remarkably, applicability even when
lacking an expert algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用置信网络（CN）作为贝叶斯网络（BN）的隐私保护替代方案，通过模糊化而非添加噪声的方式，在保护隐私的同时保持模型的有效推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着隐私问题日益严重，公开发布的贝叶斯网络模型需要保护训练数据中的敏感信息。现有的噪声添加方法虽然能提供强大的隐私保护，但会显著降低模型的效用。

Method: 将贝叶斯网络转换为置信网络，通过调整CN超参数来调节隐私保护程度，同时识别并隐藏关键学习信息以防止攻击者恢复原始BN。

Result: 数值实验证实置信网络能够在保护隐私的同时实现有意义的推理，隐私增益可以通过CN超参数进行调节。

Conclusion: 置信网络为开发隐私感知的概率图模型提供了一种原则性、实用且有效的方法，能够在隐私保护和模型效用之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable
efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective
across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The
structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly
learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes
increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive
information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize
privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine
the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals
belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection
tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this
offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the
model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the
resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of
releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks
(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After
adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the
masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful
attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve
meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key
learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from
recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical
experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN
hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical,
and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic
graphical models.

Result: 在11个基准数据集上实验表明，ζ策略在保持高精度的同时显著减少资源消耗，部分情况下甚至优于竞争对手

Conclusion: HEROS框架和ζ策略为绿色在线学习提供了有效解决方案，在预测性能和可持续性之间取得良好平衡

Abstract: Ensemble methods for stream mining necessitate managing multiple models and
updating them as data distributions evolve. Considering the calls for more
sustainability, established methods are however not sufficiently considerate of
ensemble members' computational expenses and instead overly focus on predictive
capabilities. To address these challenges and enable green online learning, we
propose heterogeneous online ensembles (HEROS). For every training step, HEROS
chooses a subset of models from a pool of models initialized with diverse
hyperparameter choices under resource constraints to train. We introduce a
Markov decision process to theoretically capture the trade-offs between
predictive performance and sustainability constraints. Based on this framework,
we present different policies for choosing which models to train on incoming
data. Most notably, we propose the novel $\zeta$-policy, which focuses on
training near-optimal models at reduced costs. Using a stochastic model, we
theoretically prove that our $\zeta$-policy achieves near optimal performance
while using fewer resources compared to the best performing policy. In our
experiments across 11 benchmark datasets, we find empiric evidence that our
$\zeta$-policy is a strong contribution to the state-of-the-art, demonstrating
highly accurate performance, in some cases even outperforming competitors, and
simultaneously being much more resource-friendly.

reflects the dependence on the number of iterations, state-action space size,
the discount factor, and the quality of exploration. In addition, we derive a
functional central limit theorem, showing that the partial-sum process
converges weakly to a Brownian motion.

Motivation: 传统脉冲神经网络虽然理论上具有高能效优势，但在实际推理过程中需要计算时间衰减函数并与突触权重相乘，这些操作消耗了大量能量。本文旨在通过利用光电设备的物理特性来消除这些昂贵的数字操作。

Method: 1. 制造定制氧化铟光电突触，利用其自然物理衰减直接实现所需的时间函数

Conclusion: 本研究建立了一种新的能效SNN范式，将基础设备物理特性直接转化为强大的计算原语，为高效SNN设计开辟了新途径

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise high energy efficiency, particularly
with time-to-first-spike (TTFS) encoding, which maximizes sparsity by emitting
at most one spike per neuron. However, such energy advantage is often
unrealized because inference requires evaluating a temporal decay function and
subsequent multiplication with the synaptic weights. This paper challenges this
costly approach by repurposing a physical hardware `bug', namely, the natural
signal decay in optoelectronic devices, as the core computation of TTFS. We
fabricated a custom indium oxide optoelectronic synapse, showing how its
natural physical decay directly implements the required temporal function. By
treating the device's analog output as the fused product of the synaptic weight
and temporal decay, optoelectronic synaptic TTFS (named Otters) eliminates
these expensive digital operations. To use the Otters paradigm in complex
architectures like the transformer, which are challenging to train directly due
to the sparsity issue, we introduce a novel quantized neural network-to-SNN
conversion algorithm. This complete hardware-software co-design enables our
model to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across seven GLUE benchmark datasets
and demonstrates a 1.77$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over previous
leading SNNs, based on a comprehensive analysis of compute, data movement, and
memory access costs using energy measurements from a commercial 22nm process.
Our work thus establishes a new paradigm for energy-efficient SNNs, translating
fundamental device physics directly into powerful computational primitives. All
codes and data are open source.

Motivation: SGNNs在真实世界标签有限或不可观测的领域取得了最先进性能，但缺乏理论基础。本文旨在建立模拟基础学习的正式理论框架。

Method: 通过理论分析证明SGNNs实现摊销贝叶斯推断，推导模型错误设定下的泛化界限，并形式化SGNNs特有的机制可解释性方法。

Result: 数值实验验证了所有理论预测：SGNNs能够恢复潜在参数，在失配情况下保持鲁棒性，在模型选择任务中表现优于经典工具（AIC误差减半）。

Conclusion: 这些结果确立了SGNNs作为数据受限科学预测的既原则又实用的框架。

Abstract: Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained
entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or
unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
  We present the foundational theory of simulation-grounded learning. We show
that SGNNs implement amortized Bayesian inference under a simulation prior and
converge to the Bayes-optimal predictor. We derive generalization bounds under
model misspecification and prove that SGNNs can learn unobservable scientific
quantities that empirical methods provably cannot. We also formalize a novel
form of mechanistic interpretability uniquely enabled by SGNNs: by attributing
predictions to the simulated mechanisms that generated them, SGNNs yield
posterior-consistent, scientifically grounded explanations.
  We provide numerical experiments to validate all theoretical predictions.
SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform
classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC
in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a
principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited
regimes.

Motivation: 当前低秩方法存在三个关键缺陷：模型性能受损、计算开销大、激活内存节省有限。需要一种既能保持性能又能真正实现高效的方法。

Method: 提出交叉层低秩残差网络(CR-Net)，采用双路径架构，通过结合前一层输出与其低秩差异来高效重建层激活，并开发专门的激活重计算策略。

Result: 在60M到7B参数规模的预训练实验中，CR-Net持续优于最先进的低秩框架，同时需要更少的计算资源和内存。

Conclusion: CR-Net成功解决了现有低秩方法的局限性，为高效大语言模型预训练提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-rank architectures have become increasingly important for efficient large
language model (LLM) pre-training, providing substantial reductions in both
parameter complexity and memory/computational demands. Despite these
advantages, current low-rank methods face three critical shortcomings: (1)
compromised model performance, (2) considerable computational overhead, and (3)
limited activation memory savings. To address these limitations, we propose
Cross-layer Low-Rank residual Network (CR-Net), an innovative
parameter-efficient framework inspired by our discovery that inter-layer
activation residuals possess low-rank properties. CR-Net implements this
insight through a dual-path architecture that efficiently reconstructs layer
activations by combining previous-layer outputs with their low-rank
differences, thereby maintaining high-rank information with minimal parameters.
We further develop a specialized activation recomputation strategy tailored for
CR-Net that dramatically reduces memory requirements. Extensive pre-training
experiments across model scales from 60M to 7B parameters demonstrate that
CR-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank frameworks while
requiring fewer computational resources and less memory.

Abstract: Representation learning from unlabeled data has been extensively studied in
statistics, data science and signal processing with a rich literature on
techniques for dimension reduction, compression, multi-dimensional scaling
among others. However, current deep learning models use new principles for
unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using
classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous
success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which
effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data.
However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by
these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks
or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine
mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an
overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from
unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.

Conclusion: FLNRM提供了一种无需先验知识的可解释解决方案，结合了深度强化学习的易用性和自动机的紧凑可解释性。

Abstract: Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks present significant
challenges, as agents must reason over entire trajectories of state-action
pairs to make optimal decisions. A common strategy to address this is through
symbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which
provide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However,
these approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the
availability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw
observations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the
temporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural
Reward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton
end-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore
as easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more
explainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore,
we show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL,
our method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs).

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了潜在空间对齐在共享表示空间下统一多模态建模的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to
significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks.
However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require
training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited
generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a
unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language
understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture.
OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and
introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the
challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM
behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to
align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge
achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks.
Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for
unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and
models are released at https://github.com/xiao-xt/OmniBridge.

Abstract: Detection of credit card fraud is an acute issue of financial security
because transaction datasets are highly lopsided, with fraud cases being only a
drop in the ocean. Balancing datasets using the most popular methods of
traditional oversampling such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE) generally create simplistic synthetic samples that are not readily
applicable to complex fraud patterns. Recent industry advances that include
Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and Tabular
Variational Autoencoders (TVAE) have demonstrated increased efficiency in
tabular synthesis, yet all these models still exhibit issues with
high-dimensional dependence modelling. Now we will present our hybrid approach
where we use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Transformer encoder
block to produce realistic fraudulent transactions samples. The GAN
architecture allows training realistic generators adversarial, and the
Transformer allows the model to learn rich feature interactions by
self-attention. Such a hybrid strategy overcomes the limitations of SMOTE,
CTGAN, and TVAE by producing a variety of high-quality synthetic minority
classes samples. We test our algorithm on the publicly-available Credit Card
Fraud Detection dataset and compare it to conventional and generative
resampling strategies with a variety of classifiers, such as Logistic
Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and
Support Vector Machine (SVM). Findings indicate that our Transformer-based GAN
shows substantial gains in Recall, F1-score and Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which indicates that it is effective in
overcoming the severe class imbalance inherent in the task of fraud detection.

*Yang Li,Chenyu Wang,Tingrui Wang,Yongwei Wang,Haonan Li,Zhunga Liu,Quan Pan*

TL;DR: JAD是一个基于潜在扩散模型的黑盒对抗攻击框架，通过联合注意力蒸馏策略实现跨架构的对抗样本生成，提高攻击泛化能力和生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击方法依赖特定网络架构或需要大量查询，导致跨架构迁移性差且查询成本高。

Method: JAD利用潜在扩散模型，通过从CNN和ViT模型中提取的注意力图指导生成对抗扰动，聚焦于跨架构共同的敏感图像区域。

Result: 实验表明JAD在攻击泛化性、生成效率和跨架构迁移性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JAD为黑盒对抗攻击提供了一个有前景的有效范式，具有架构无关性和高生成效率。

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to
model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network
architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited
cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these
limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box
adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent
diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on
image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach
crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different
model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be
architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse
models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high
adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative
queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack
generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability
compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for
black-box adversarial attacks.

*Przemysław Spyra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文系统比较了三种无需反向传播的深度学习训练方法（FF、CaFo、MF），发现MF算法在MLP架构上不仅达到甚至超越了BP的性能，同时显著降低了能耗和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的计算和能耗需求日益增长，主要受反向传播训练方法的驱动，这挑战了可持续AI发展。研究旨在寻找更节能高效的替代训练方法。

Method: 建立了严格的比较框架，在各自原生架构上实现三种BP-free算法（FF、MF使用MLP，CaFo使用CNN），使用Optuna优化超参数，基于验证性能应用一致的早停标准，并通过NVML API和CodeCarbon进行硬件级能耗分析。

Result: MF算法在分类准确率上不仅与BP相当甚至更优，能耗降低达41%，训练时间缩短达34%，收敛到验证损失景观中更有利的最小值。

Conclusion: MF算法综合了准确性和可持续性优势，挑战了全局优化必要性的假设，为未来节能深度学习提供了数据驱动的路线图。

Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of deep neural networks (DNNs),
driven largely by backpropagation (BP), challenge sustainable AI development.
This paper rigorously investigates three BP-free training methods: the
Forward-Forward (FF), Cascaded-Forward (CaFo), and Mono-Forward (MF)
algorithms, tracing their progression from foundational concepts to a
demonstrably superior solution.
  A robust comparative framework was established: each algorithm was
implemented on its native architecture (MLPs for FF and MF, a CNN for CaFo) and
benchmarked against an equivalent BP-trained model. Hyperparameters were
optimized with Optuna, and consistent early stopping criteria were applied
based on validation performance, ensuring all models were optimally tuned
before comparison.
  Results show that MF not only competes with but consistently surpasses BP in
classification accuracy on its native MLPs. Its superior generalization stems
from converging to a more favorable minimum in the validation loss landscape,
challenging the assumption that global optimization is required for
state-of-the-art results. Measured at the hardware level using the NVIDIA
Management Library (NVML) API, MF reduces energy consumption by up to 41% and
shortens training time by up to 34%, translating to a measurably smaller carbon
footprint as estimated by CodeCarbon.
  Beyond this primary result, we present a hardware-level analysis that
explains the efficiency gains: exposing FF's architectural inefficiencies,
validating MF's computationally lean design, and challenging the assumption
that all BP-free methods are inherently more memory-efficient. By documenting
the evolution from FF's conceptual groundwork to MF's synthesis of accuracy and
sustainability, this work offers a clear, data-driven roadmap for future
energy-efficient deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDVI方法使用固定的无条件起始分布，与复杂真实后验分布差距较大，导致推理轨迹效率低下和收敛缓慢。

Method: DBVI通过参数化的神经网络从可学习的数据相关初始分布开始反向扩散，使用ELBO目标的梯度逐步适应，并利用诱导输入作为低维摘要进行可扩展摊销。

Result: 在回归、分类和图像重建任务中，DBVI在预测准确性、收敛速度和后验质量方面一致优于DDVI和其他变分基线。

Conclusion: DBVI保留了DDVI的数学优雅性，同时通过可学习的初始分布显著提高了推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian
modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially
over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI)
addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a
simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting
distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in
inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we
propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension
of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent
initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized
neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO
objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To
enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing
inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and
naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the
mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time
SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We
derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI
for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification,
and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other
variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior
quality.

TL;DR: AxelGNN是一种新颖的图神经网络架构，受Axelrod文化传播模型启发，通过相似性门控概率交互、特征级复制机制和全局极化保持来解决GNN的特征过度平滑、异构关系处理困难和特征向量处理不灵活等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在深层网络中节点表示不可区分、难以有效处理异构关系以及将特征向量作为不可分单元处理导致灵活性受限等基本限制。

Method: 基于Axelrod文化传播模型，采用相似性门控概率交互机制自适应促进收敛或发散，实现特征级复制机制进行细粒度特征聚合，并保持全局极化以维护节点在不同表示簇中的独特性。

Result: 在节点分类和影响力估计基准测试中，AxelGNN在具有不同同质-异质特征的多样化图结构上始终优于或匹配最先进的GNN方法。

Conclusion: AxelGNN的双稳态收敛动力学自然地在单一架构内处理同质和异质图，为解决GNN的基本限制提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations:
feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become
indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage
heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and
they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits
flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel
GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that
addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates
similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence
or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying
mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and
maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple
representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally
handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture.
Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation
benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying
homophily-heterophily characteristics.

Method: 提出KL-UCB-Transfer索引策略，该策略结合了源分布的样本信息（N'_k个i.i.d.样本）、分布间距离界限（d_k ≤ L_k）以及KL散度上置信界方法。

Result: 在Gaussian情况下，KL-UCB-Transfer算法达到了问题相关的渐进下界；仿真验证表明当源分布和目标分布足够接近时，该算法显著优于无先验基线。

Conclusion: 迁移学习框架可以有效提升多臂老虎机性能，KL-UCB-Transfer算法在理论分析和实验验证中都表现出色，为利用先验知识解决老虎机问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: We study the non-contextual multi-armed bandit problem in a transfer learning
setting: before any pulls, the learner is given N'_k i.i.d. samples from each
source distribution nu'_k, and the true target distributions nu_k lie within a
known distance bound d_k(nu_k, nu'_k) <= L_k. In this framework, we first
derive a problem-dependent asymptotic lower bound on cumulative regret that
extends the classical Lai-Robbins result to incorporate the transfer parameters
(d_k, L_k, N'_k). We then propose KL-UCB-Transfer, a simple index policy that
matches this new bound in the Gaussian case. Finally, we validate our approach
via simulations, showing that KL-UCB-Transfer significantly outperforms the
no-prior baseline when source and target distributions are sufficiently close.

Abstract: Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical
applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against
adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we
discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable
robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in
computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training
paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of
domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to
generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test
distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art
generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image
classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language
models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that
elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses,
which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based
agents.

Motivation: 现有的离线RLHF方法存在过优化问题，模型会过度拟合奖励错误规范并偏离训练期间观察到的偏好行为。

Method: 提出DRO-REBEL统一框架，使用Fenchel对偶将更新简化为相对奖励回归，避免PPO式裁剪和辅助价值网络，并推导出三种散度的实用SGD算法。

Result: 在Emotion Alignment、ArmoRM多目标基准和HH-Alignment上的实验显示，该方法在未见偏好混合、模型大小和数据规模上具有强鲁棒性，χ²-REBEL表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究验证了无免费午餐权衡：半径收缩速度快于经验散度集中率可实现最优参数率但丧失覆盖率，而保证覆盖率的半径会导致O(n^{-1/4})速率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become crucial for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, existing
offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to
reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during
training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with
type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality,
each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving
scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under
standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage
condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants
than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$
rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes
the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal
parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences:
gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast
1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale
ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong
worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data
scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance.
A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii
shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve
minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while
coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as
diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error
codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like
healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label
causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising
of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as
domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in
parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an
adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of
labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at
scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional
independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault
prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced
labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
privacy-preserving model training, yet deployments in sensitive domains such as
healthcare face persistent challenges from non-IID data, client unreliability,
and adversarial manipulation. This paper introduces FedFiTS, a trust and
fairness-aware selective FL framework that advances the FedFaSt line by
combining fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation. FedFiTS
implements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural
selection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client
scoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance
convergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis
establishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard
assumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions
relative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical
imaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular
agricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently
outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and
resilience to poisoning attacks. By integrating trust-aware aggregation with
fairness-oriented client selection, FedFiTS advances scalable and secure FL,
making it well suited for real-world healthcare and cross-domain deployments.

Abstract: The study on architecture and parameter characteristics remains the hot topic
in the research of large language models. In this paper we concern with the
characteristics of weight which are used to analyze the correlations and
differences between models. Two kinds of vectors-standard deviation vector and
clustering vector-are proposed to describe features of models. In the first
case, the weights are assumed to follow normal distribution. The standard
deviation values of projection matrices are normalized to form
Standard-Deviation Vector, representing the distribution characteristics of
models. In the second case, the singular values from each weight projection
matrix are extracted and grouped by K-Means algorithm. The grouped data with
the same type matrix are combined as Clustering Vector to represent the
correlation characteristics of models' weights. The study reveals that these
two vectors can effectively distinguish between different models and clearly
show the similarities among models of the same family. Moreover, after
conducting LoRA fine-tuning with different datasets and models, it is found
that the distribution of weights represented by standard deviation vector is
directly influenced by the dataset, but the correlations between different
weights represented by clustering vector remain unaffected and maintain a high
consistency with the pre-trained model.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling
these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the
difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating
stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces
PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between
hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs
concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by
the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation
engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the
generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator
utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on
long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL
achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL
baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and
modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key
contribution.

Abstract: Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a
unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle
regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal
framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the
semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of
four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE)
integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal
rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory
Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and
behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively.
Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference
cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance
interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads
transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream
tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world
datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate
performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user
identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and
substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of
GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond
raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling
provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and
generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a significant challenge for efficient
reinforcement learning for decades (Ring 1994, Rivest and Precup 2003). While
recent works have proposed effective methods to mitigate this issue, they
mainly focus on the algorithmic side. Meanwhile, we do not fully understand
what architectural properties of neural networks lead to catastrophic
forgetting. This study aims to fill this gap by studying the role of activation
functions in the training dynamics of neural networks and their impact on
catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning setup. Our study reveals
that, besides sparse representations, the gradient sparsity of activation
functions also plays an important role in reducing forgetting. Based on this
insight, we propose a new class of activation functions, elephant activation
functions, that can generate both sparse outputs and sparse gradients. We show
that by simply replacing classical activation functions with elephant
activation functions in the neural networks of value-based algorithms, we can
significantly improve the resilience of neural networks to catastrophic
forgetting, thus making reinforcement learning more sample-efficient and

*Binghui Li,Fengling Chen,Zixun Huang,Lean Wang,Lei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了功能缩放定律（FSL）框架，通过随机微分方程建模SGD训练过程，揭示了学习率调度对LLM预训练损失动态的影响，并理论验证了常见训练实践的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要关注最终损失，忽略了训练过程中的损失动态和学习率调度的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，深入理解LLM预训练的动态过程。

Method: 使用师生核回归设置和在线随机梯度下降训练，引入内在时间视角和随机微分方程建模，提出功能缩放定律（FSL）框架。

Result: FSL能够准确捕捉不同学习率调度对训练过程的影响，理论验证了高容量模型更高效、学习率衰减提升效率等经验实践，并在0.1B-1B参数规模的实验中展示了实用价值。

Conclusion: FSL框架深化了对LLM预训练动态的理解，为大规模模型训练优化提供了理论指导和实践洞察。

Abstract: Scaling laws have played a cornerstone role in guiding the training of large
language models (LLMs). However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily
focus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training
process and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this
paper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel
regression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
Leveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential
equation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL),
which characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training
process for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured
through an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects
fully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used
LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under
both data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical
justification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such
as (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)
learning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules
can outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical
relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing
the loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model
sizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen
the understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for
improving large-scale model training.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于训练数据的弱鲁棒样本验证方法，通过局部鲁棒性分析识别最易受扰动的样本，作为模型脆弱性的早期敏感指标，从而指导针对性性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒性验证依赖扰动测试数据集，但本文旨在直接从训练数据中提取弱鲁棒样本来更早、更敏感地识别模型漏洞。

Method: 通过局部鲁棒性分析从训练数据中提取最易受扰动的弱鲁棒样本，用这些样本评估模型鲁棒性并指导性能增强。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上的实验证明，基于弱鲁棒样本的鲁棒性验证能有效提升模型在对抗性和常见扰动场景下的可靠性。

Conclusion: 弱鲁棒样本可作为模型脆弱性的有效指标，基于此的验证方法能驱动模型鲁棒性的实质性改进。

Abstract: Data-driven models, especially deep learning classifiers often demonstrate
great success on clean datasets. Yet, they remain vulnerable to common data
distortions such as adversarial and common corruption perturbations. These
perturbations can significantly degrade performance, thereby challenging the
overall reliability of the models. Traditional robustness validation typically
relies on perturbed test datasets to assess and improve model performance. In
our framework, however, we propose a validation approach that extracts "weak
robust" samples directly from the training dataset via local robustness
analysis. These samples, being the most susceptible to perturbations, serve as
an early and sensitive indicator of the model's vulnerabilities. By evaluating
models on these challenging training instances, we gain a more nuanced
understanding of its robustness, which informs targeted performance
enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on models trained
with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, highlighting how robustness validation
guided by weak robust samples can drive meaningful improvements in model
reliability under adversarial and common corruption scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedFusion是一个联邦迁移学习框架，通过统一域适应和节俭标注技术，结合多样性/聚类感知编码器，在异构特征空间、非IID数据和标签稀缺的联邦学习场景中实现鲁棒性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际联邦学习中面临的异构特征空间、严重非IID数据和跨客户端标签稀缺等挑战，需要一种能够协调个性化、域适应和标签效率的综合方法。

Method: FedFusion框架结合了域适应和节俭标注技术，使用多样性/聚类感知编码器（DivEn、DivEn-mix、DivEn-c）。通过置信度过滤的伪标签和域自适应传输，有标签的教师客户端指导学习者客户端，同时客户端维护针对本地数据定制的个性化编码器。采用相似性加权的分类器耦合（可选聚类平均）来保持全局一致性。

Result: 在表格和图像基准测试中，无论是IID、非IID还是标签稀缺场景下，FedFusion在准确性、鲁棒性和公平性方面都持续优于最先进的基线方法，同时保持可比较的通信和计算预算。

Conclusion: 协调个性化、域适应和标签效率是实现在现实世界约束下鲁棒联邦学习的有效方法，FedFusion框架为此提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning in practice must contend with heterogeneous feature
spaces, severe non-IID data, and scarce labels across clients. We present
FedFusion, a federated transfer-learning framework that unifies domain
adaptation and frugal labelling with diversity-/cluster-aware encoders (DivEn,
DivEn-mix, DivEn-c). Labelled teacher clients guide learner clients via
confidence-filtered pseudo-labels and domain-adaptive transfer, while clients
maintain personalised encoders tailored to local data. To preserve global
coherence under heterogeneity, FedFusion employs similarity-weighted classifier
coupling (with optional cluster-wise averaging), mitigating dominance by
data-rich sites and improving minority-client performance. The frugal-labelling
pipeline combines self-/semi-supervised pretext training with selective
fine-tuning, reducing annotation demands without sharing raw data. Across
tabular and imaging benchmarks under IID, non-IID, and label-scarce regimes,
FedFusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy,
robustness, and fairness while maintaining comparable communication and
computation budgets. These results show that harmonising personalisation,
domain adaptation, and label efficiency is an effective recipe for robust
federated learning under real-world constraints.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了开源文本到视频生成模型的延迟和能耗，建立了计算受限的分析模型，验证了空间分辨率、时间长度和去噪步骤的缩放规律，并对六种T2V模型进行了能耗分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成系统虽然能生成高质量视频，但计算成本高昂且能耗特性未被充分理解，需要系统研究其延迟和能耗特性。

Method: 首先开发计算受限的分析模型预测缩放规律，然后在WAN2.1-T2V模型上进行细粒度实验验证，最后扩展到六种不同T2V模型的运行时和能耗分析。

Result: 验证了空间和时间维度上的二次增长规律，以及去噪步骤的线性缩放规律，为不同T2V模型提供了能耗基准数据。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计和部署更可持续的生成视频系统提供了基准参考和实用见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have enabled the creation
of high-fidelity, temporally coherent clips from natural language prompts. Yet
these systems come with significant computational costs, and their energy
demands remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic study
of the latency and energy consumption of state-of-the-art open-source T2V
models. We first develop a compute-bound analytical model that predicts scaling
laws with respect to spatial resolution, temporal length, and denoising steps.
We then validate these predictions through fine-grained experiments on
WAN2.1-T2V, showing quadratic growth with spatial and temporal dimensions, and
linear scaling with the number of denoising steps. Finally, we extend our
analysis to six diverse T2V models, comparing their runtime and energy profiles
under default settings. Our results provide both a benchmark reference and
practical insights for designing and deploying more sustainable generative
video systems.

Conclusion: 物理约束的融合策略对机器学习模型的性能有重要影响，研究提供了可复现的实现方案，为电力系统混合模型的发展提供了指导。

Abstract: In the context of the energy transition, with increasing integration of
renewable sources and cross-border electricity exchanges, power grids are
encountering greater uncertainty and operational risk. Maintaining grid
stability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators
are commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before
implementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are
often too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as
fast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g.,
Kirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are
also known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an
ablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from
incorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised
losses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to
advanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics
equations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called
LIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical
compliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The
results highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across
these criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the
corresponding Github page.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练虽然增强模型鲁棒性，但常出现鲁棒过拟合和泛化差距扩大的问题。现有研究已证明去中心化网络中对抗训练的收敛性，但其泛化特性尚未被探索。

Method: 采用基于稳定性的分析方法，针对扩散策略下的凸损失函数进行理论推导，并通过逻辑回归进行数值实验验证。

Result: 推导出泛化误差界，显示泛化误差随对抗扰动强度和训练步数增加而增长，这一发现与单智能体情况一致，但在去中心化设置中是新颖的。

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了理论预测，为去中心化对抗训练的泛化特性提供了理论分析框架。

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is an established tool for analyzing generalization.
While adversarial training enhances model robustness, it often suffers from
robust overfitting and an enlarged generalization gap. Although recent work has
established the convergence of adversarial training in decentralized networks,
its generalization properties remain unexplored. This work presents a
stability-based generalization analysis of adversarial training under the
diffusion strategy for convex losses. We derive a bound showing that the
generalization error grows with both the adversarial perturbation strength and
the number of training steps, a finding consistent with single-agent case but
novel for decentralized settings. Numerical experiments on logistic regression
validate these theoretical predictions.

*Yunzhen Feng,Julia Kempe,Cheng Zhang,Parag Jain,Anthony Hartshorn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在大型推理模型中，更长的思维链（CoT）和更多的回顾步骤反而会降低准确性。作者提出了一种图结构的CoT分析方法，并发现"失败步骤比例（FSF）"是预测正确性的关键指标。通过实验证明，减少失败分支可以显著提高推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在测试时需要大量计算资源来处理长思维链，但什么构成有效的思维链仍不清楚。虽然有研究认为更长的思维链和更多回顾步骤能提升性能，但近期研究显示短思维链可能表现更好。作者旨在系统性地评估思维链长度和结构对推理准确性的影响。

Method: 作者在10个大型推理模型上进行了数学和科学推理的系统评估，引入了图结构的思维链分析方法，提出了失败步骤比例（FSF）指标，并设计了两种干预实验：基于指标对候选思维链进行排名，以及编辑思维链移除失败分支。

Result: 研究发现，思维链的简单延长和增加回顾步骤与准确性降低相关。FSF指标在预测正确性方面优于长度和回顾比例指标。通过移除失败分支的干预实验显著提高了准确性，表明失败分支会对后续推理产生偏见。

Conclusion: 有效的思维链是那些失败步骤较少的思维链，支持基于结构感知的测试时扩展策略，而不是盲目生成长思维链。研究结果为优化推理模型的思维链生成提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long
chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT
remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and
increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent
studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We
therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and
scientific reasoning. Contrary to the "longer-is-better" narrative, we find
that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with
*lower* accuracy.
  As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with
process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and
identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of
steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review
ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two
interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where
FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed
branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed
branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize
effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware*
test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个成本效益分析框架，帮助组织评估本地部署开源大语言模型与使用商业订阅服务的经济可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的普及，组织面临选择商业订阅服务还是本地部署的决策。商业云服务虽然易于使用和扩展，但存在数据隐私、供应商锁定和长期运营成本等问题，这推动了本地部署开源模型的兴趣。

Method: 通过分析硬件需求、运营费用和最新开源模型（如Qwen、Llama、Mistral等）的性能基准，将本地部署的总成本与主要云服务提供商的订阅费用进行比较。

Result: 研究提供了基于使用水平和性能需求的盈亏平衡点估计。

Conclusion: 这些结果为组织规划其LLM战略提供了实用的决策框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread.
Organizations that want to use AI for productivity now face an important
decision. They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on
their own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI,
Anthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to
state-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data
privacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating
costs have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This
paper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations
determine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared
to commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements,
operational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source
models, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost
of deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription
fee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels
and performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework
for planning their LLM strategies.

Motivation: 现有土壤湿度时间序列分析方法要么依赖基于阈值的规则，要么需要大量数据的机器学习模型，存在适应性和可解释性限制。

Method: 利用ChatGPT-4.1的推理能力，将时间序列数据转换为文本表示，通过领域知识提示模板进行零样本分析，检测灌溉事件、估计净灌溉增益、检测分类异常。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为精准农业的可扩展、适应性强的工具，能够整合定性知识和数据驱动推理，为土壤湿度监测和灌溉调度提供可操作见解。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of soil moisture patterns is critical for irrigation
scheduling and crop management, yet existing approaches for soil moisture
time-series analysis either rely on threshold-based rules or data-hungry
machine learning or deep learning models that are limited in adaptability and
interpretability. In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and
Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil
moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced
reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis
without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting
time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed
prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation
gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable
reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data
from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the
United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method
in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately
classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and
recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to
capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide
interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study
highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision
agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and
data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture
monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗AI系统未能以符合临床推理的方式明确量化或传达不确定性，现有可解释AI(XAI)和不确定性估计(UE)技术存在脱节，限制了AI在医疗领域的应用。

Method: 系统地将医疗不确定性映射到AI不确定性概念，识别XUE实施的关键挑战，提出多模态不确定性量化、模型无关可视化技术和不确定性感知决策支持系统等技术方向。

Result: 建立了连接可解释性和不确定性的理论框架，为开发符合临床复杂性的可信医疗AI系统提供了指导原则。

Conclusion: XUE框架通过弥合可解释性和不确定性之间的差距，为开发与真实世界临床复杂性相一致的AI系统铺平了道路，有助于构建可信赖的医疗AI。

Abstract: Uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in medical practice, but current
medical AI systems fail to explicitly quantify or communicate uncertainty in a
way that aligns with clinical reasoning. Existing XAI works focus on
interpreting model predictions but do not capture the confidence or reliability
of these predictions. Conversely, uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques
provide confidence measures but lack intuitive explanations. The disconnect
between these two areas limits AI adoption in medicine. To address this gap, we
propose Explainable Uncertainty Estimation (XUE) that integrates explainability
with uncertainty quantification to enhance trust and usability in medical AI.
We systematically map medical uncertainty to AI uncertainty concepts and
identify key challenges in implementing XUE. We outline technical directions
for advancing XUE, including multimodal uncertainty quantification,
model-agnostic visualization techniques, and uncertainty-aware decision support
systems. Lastly, we propose guiding principles to ensure effective XUE
realisation. Our analysis highlights the need for AI systems that not only
generate reliable predictions but also articulate confidence levels in a
clinically meaningful way. This work contributes to the development of
trustworthy medical AI by bridging explainability and uncertainty, paving the
way for AI systems that are aligned with real-world clinical complexities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文档语义解析面临二次复杂度增长和内存需求激增的挑战，需要一种可扩展的解决方案来支持超长文本的实时处理。

Method: 将输入文档分解为M个段落，为每个段落构建局部语义图，提取摘要节点形成全局图记忆，支持增量更新和分层查询处理。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，HSGM实现了2-4倍的推理加速，峰值内存减少超过60%，同时保持基线准确率的95%以上。

Conclusion: HSGM为超长文本的可扩展、准确语义建模提供了有效解决方案，支持实时和资源受限的NLP应用。

Abstract: Semantic parsing of long documents remains challenging due to quadratic
growth in pairwise composition and memory requirements. We introduce
\textbf{Hierarchical Segment-Graph Memory (HSGM)}, a novel framework that
decomposes an input of length $N$ into $M$ meaningful segments, constructs
\emph{Local Semantic Graphs} on each segment, and extracts compact
\emph{summary nodes} to form a \emph{Global Graph Memory}. HSGM supports
\emph{incremental updates} -- only newly arrived segments incur local graph
construction and summary-node integration -- while \emph{Hierarchical Query
Processing} locates relevant segments via top-$K$ retrieval over summary nodes
and then performs fine-grained reasoning within their local graphs.
  Theoretically, HSGM reduces worst-case complexity from $O(N^2)$ to
$O\!\left(N\,k + (N/k)^2\right)$, with segment size $k \ll N$, and we derive
Frobenius-norm bounds on the approximation error introduced by node
summarization and sparsification thresholds. Empirically, on three benchmarks
-- long-document AMR parsing, segment-level semantic role labeling (OntoNotes),
and legal event extraction -- HSGM achieves \emph{2--4$\times$ inference
speedup}, \emph{$>60\%$ reduction} in peak memory, and \emph{$\ge 95\%$} of
baseline accuracy. Our approach unlocks scalable, accurate semantic modeling
for ultra-long texts, enabling real-time and resource-constrained NLP
applications.

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in
engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create
significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a
multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow
from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical
gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation:
Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline,
including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of
handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic
generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via
ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent,
the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as
discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other
agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3.
High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a
Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a
dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2%
success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing
frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the
expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems
can democratize complex scientific computing. The code is public at

Result: LLMs在OR领域展现出潜力，能够提升问题建模和求解效率，但存在语义到结构映射不稳定、研究进展碎片化、泛化能力有限和评估体系不足等问题。

Conclusion: LLMs为OR领域带来新的机遇，未来需要解决现有挑战，推进LLMs在OR中的更深入应用和发展。

Abstract: Operations research (OR) provides fundamental methodologies for complex
system decision-making, with established applications in transportation, supply
chain management, and production scheduling. Traditional approaches, which
depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face
challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these
limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and
reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into
mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms,
and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on
the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions:
automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further
reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes
key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented
research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems.
Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role
of LLMs in OR.

### [255] [Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting Actions (SAPA): Behavioral Theory-Guided LLMs for Ridesourcing Mode Choice Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18181)
*Mustafa Sameen,Xiaojian Zhang,Xilei Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了SAPA框架，利用大语言模型合成理论基础的潜在态度来预测网约车选择，显著提升了预测准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网约车模式选择模型预测精度有限，无法捕捉关键心理因素，且面临严重的类别不平衡问题

Method: SAPA采用分层方法：1）用LLM从原始调查数据生成定性旅行者画像；2）训练倾向得分模型；3）LLM为理论驱动的潜在变量分配量化分数；4）最终分类器整合所有特征进行预测

Result: 在大规模多年旅行调查上的实验显示，SAPA在PR-AUC指标上比最先进基线方法提升高达75.9%

Conclusion: SAPA为准确预测网约车选择提供了强大工具，其方法论可轻松迁移到各种应用中

Abstract: Accurate modeling of ridesourcing mode choices is essential for designing and
implementing effective traffic management policies for reducing congestion,
improving mobility, and allocating resources more efficiently. Existing models
for predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive
accuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are
further challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise
only a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting
Actions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict
ridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler
personas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model
on demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce
an individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to
theory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final
classifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their
interaction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode
choice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing
choice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set.
This study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode
choices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OBER是一个基于学习成果的教育推荐系统，通过将学习成果和评估项目嵌入数据模式，使任何推荐算法都能根据其促进的掌握程度进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数教育推荐系统仅基于点击或评分相关性进行调优和判断，其真实的教学影响不明确。需要一种能够直接评估推荐系统对学生学习成果影响的方法。

Method: OBER采用极简的实体关系模型、日志驱动的掌握度公式和插件架构。在非正式学习领域的电子学习系统中进行了为期两周的随机分组测试，比较了固定专家轨迹、协同过滤和基于知识的过滤三种方法。

Result: 协同过滤最大化了用户留存率，但固定路径方法实现了最高的掌握度。OBER可以从相同的日志中导出业务、相关性和学习指标。

Conclusion: OBER框架是方法无关的，可以轻松扩展到未来的自适应或情境感知推荐系统，让实践者能够在没有额外测试开销的情况下权衡相关性、参与度和成果掌握度。

Abstract: Most educational recommender systems are tuned and judged on click- or
rating-based relevance, leaving their true pedagogical impact unclear. We
introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning
outcomes and assessment items directly into the data schema, so any algorithm
can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist
entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in
architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was
evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners
across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF),
and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path
achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and
learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and
engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The
framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or
context-aware recommenders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设训练和测试时所有数据模态和连接车辆都可用，这在传感器故障或协作车辆缺失时不切实际

Method: 使用教师-学生模型结构进行跨模态知识蒸馏，教师模型用多模态数据训练，学生模型设计为在模态减少时仍能有效工作

Result: 在连接自动驾驶和空地车辆协作实验中，方法将驾驶安全性提高了20.7%，在潜在事故检测和安全驾驶决策方面超过现有最佳基线

Conclusion: MMCD框架通过多模态协作和知识蒸馏技术，显著提升了自动驾驶系统在挑战性环境中的鲁棒性和安全性

Abstract: Autonomous systems have advanced significantly, but challenges persist in
accident-prone environments where robust decision-making is crucial. A single
vehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of
accidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches,
leveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising
solutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data
modalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is
impractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal
Collaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses
multi-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance
decision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when
certain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach
based on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model
structure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while
the student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities.
In experiments on $\textit{connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles}$
and $\textit{aerial-ground vehicles collaboration}$, our method improves
driving safety by up to ${\it 20.7}\%$, surpassing the best-existing baseline
in detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions. More

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种形式化方法来解释定量双极论证框架（QBAF）中推理变化的原因，通过追踪论证强度排序的不一致性变化，并识别出导致这些变化的特定论证作为解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当从QBAF中得出结论并更新QBAF后再次得出结论时，需要追踪论证强度排序的变化（称为强度不一致性），以理解推理变化的原因。

Method: 定义了强度不一致性的充分、必要和反事实解释，提出了基于启发式的方法来搜索强度不一致性解释，并提供了相应的实现。

Result: 证明了强度不一致性解释存在当且仅当更新导致强度不一致性，开发了有效的搜索算法来识别解释。

Conclusion: 该方法为QBAF中的推理变化提供了形式化的解释框架，有助于理解论证系统动态变化的内在机制。

Abstract: This paper presents a formal approach to explaining change of inference in
Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs). When drawing conclusions
from a QBAF and updating the QBAF to then again draw conclusions (and so on),
our approach traces changes -- which we call strength inconsistencies -- in the
partial order over argument strengths that a semantics establishes on some
arguments of interest, called topic arguments. We trace the causes of strength
inconsistencies to specific arguments, which then serve as explanations. We
identify sufficient, necessary, and counterfactual explanations for strength
inconsistencies and show that strength inconsistency explanations exist if and
only if an update leads to strength inconsistency. We define a heuristic-based
approach to facilitate the search for strength inconsistency explanations, for
which we also provide an implementation.

*Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Neural DNA（nDNA）作为语义基因型表示，通过潜在几何结构捕捉AI基础模型的内部认知身份，包括谱曲率、热力学长度和信念向量场三个维度，用于追踪模型谱系、检测漂移和研究人工认知进化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试仅衡量模型行为，但模型的"灵魂"存在于其潜在几何结构中。需要一种能够捕捉模型内部认知身份的方法，以理解模型的谱系、突变和语义继承。

Method: 提出nDNA表示方法，基于三个几何维度：谱曲率（揭示跨层的概念流曲率）、热力学长度（量化通过层的表示转换所需的语义努力）和信念向量场（描述引导模型信念方向取向的语义扭转场）。

Result: nDNA提供了稳定、坐标无关的神经DNA指纹，可用于追踪预训练、微调、对齐、剪枝、蒸馏和合并等过程中的谱系，测量检查点之间的继承关系，检测新数据或目标下特征的漂移。

Conclusion: 这项工作开启了神经基因组学新领域，将模型视为具有可追踪内部认知的数字语义有机体，为比较模型、诊断风险和管理随时间变化提供了新方法。

Abstract: As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What
shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output?
Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent
geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic
representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic
geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and
indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals
the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which
quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational
transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the
semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations.
Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance,
found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural
drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not
just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.
  Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid--dynamics:
meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is
the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how
meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free
neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we
cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning,
alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between
checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and,
ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models,
diagnose risks, and govern change over time.

*Kei-Sing Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了相似性场理论，这是一个数学框架，用于形式化实体间相似性关系及其演化的原则。该理论定义了相似性场、系统演化、概念纤维和生成算子，并基于此形式化地定义了智能的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者认为持久化和转换相似性关系构成了任何可理解动态系统的结构基础。需要建立一个数学框架来形式化相似性值及其演化的原则，为表征、比较和构建智能系统提供基础语言。

Method: 定义了相似性场S: U×U→[0,1]，满足自反性但允许不对称性和非传递性；系统演化序列Zp=(Xp,S(p))；概念K诱导纤维Fα(K)；生成算子G。基于此形式化智能定义：若G能生成属于概念K纤维的新实体，则G相对于K是智能的。

Result: 证明了两个定理：(i)不对称性阻止相互包含；(ii)稳定性需要锚坐标或最终限制在f的水平集内。这些结果确保相似性场演化既受约束又可解释。

Conclusion: 相似性场理论为表征、比较和构建智能系统提供了基础框架，并可用于解释大语言模型和将其作为社会认知的实验探针。

Abstract: We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the
structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces
Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the
principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We
define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of
entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed
relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the
evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by
$p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers
$F_{\alpha}(K) = { E \in U \mid S(E,K) \ge \alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of
the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that
produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative
definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a
concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of
$K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field
Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and
constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks
mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or
eventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the
evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable,
culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large
language models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition.

Abstract: With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and
heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable
sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI
framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose
VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer
with a large language model (LLM) inference head embedded in its top layer. The
system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic
models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with
cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images,
fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives
using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion
block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer
decoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease
ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels
in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention
mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an
average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.

Motivation: 个性化食谱推荐面临处理模糊用户意图、确保语义准确性和提供足够细节覆盖的挑战。

Method: 提出ChefMind混合架构：探索链(CoE)将模糊查询转化为结构化条件，知识图谱(KG)提供语义推理和可解释性，检索增强生成(RAG)补充上下文烹饪细节，大语言模型(LLM)整合输出为连贯推荐。

Result: 在小厨房数据集和手动标注查询上的评估显示，ChefMind在准确性、相关性、完整性和清晰度方面表现优异，平均得分8.7，而消融模型为6.4-6.7。未处理查询减少至1.6%，证明在处理模糊需求方面具有鲁棒性。

evaluate ChefMind on the Xiachufang dataset and manually annotated queries,
comparing it with LLM-only, KG-only, and RAG-only baselines. Results show that
ChefMind achieves superior performance in accuracy, relevance, completeness,

Moreover, it reduces unprocessed queries to 1.6%, demonstrating robustness in
handling fuzzy demands.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种"N+1"GPT代理架构，用于机械工程问题的初步分析。该架构通过多个独立求解代理和比较代理来提高GPT在工程问题求解中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPT在解决机械工程问题时存在不稳定性，成功率仅为85%，这种不可靠性使其无法直接应用于教育或工程实践。

Method: 采用"N+1"代理架构：首先启动N个独立的求解代理生成N个解决方案，然后通过比较代理对这些方案进行汇总、比较，并推荐最优解。基于Condorcet陪审团定理，当每个求解代理的成功概率大于1/2且N足够大时，多数投票的解决方案大概率是正确的。

Result: 该方法能够显著提高GPT在机械工程问题求解中的可靠性，比较代理还能整合不同的问题理解和求解方法。与商业多代理模型Grok Heavy相比，该架构更注重透明度和教学价值。

Conclusion: 提出的"N+1"GPT代理架构为解决GPT在工程应用中的不可靠性问题提供了有效方案，特别适合教育场景，能够提高解决方案的质量和可信度。

Abstract: Generative AI, and specifically GPT, can produce a remarkable solution to a
mechanical engineering analysis problem - but also, on occasion, a flawed
solution. For example, an elementary mechanics problem is solved flawlessly in
one GPT instance and incorrectly in a subsequent GPT instance, with a success
probability of only 85%. This unreliability renders "out-of-the-box" GPT
unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice. We introduce an
"N-Plus-1" GPT Agency for Initial (Low-Cost) Analysis of mechanical engineering
Problem Statements. Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to
yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes
Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution
Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from
Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by
per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the
Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high
probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore,
Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare)
Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative
Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or
alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures. Comparisons to Grok Heavy, a
commercial multi-agent model, show similarities in design and performance, but
also important differences in emphasis: our Agency focuses on transparency and
pedagogical value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在桌面应用控制中存在推理延迟高、样本效率低、无法在设备上部署等问题，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层强化学习框架，包含三级模态状态编码器（截图、任务ID、数值状态），集成元动作和提前停止机制，使用紧凑的视觉骨干网络和小型策略网络。

Result: 在135个真实桌面任务测试中，简单任务成功率92.1%，困难任务成功率58.8%，性能匹配或超过200B参数MLLM基线，同时模型规模减小4个数量级，推理时间减半。

Conclusion: 分层强化学习为计算机控制提供了一个实用、可扩展的替代方案，优于传统的基于单体MLLM的自动化方法。

Abstract: Controlling desktop applications via software remains a fundamental yet
under-served problem. Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest
screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but
they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on
long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We
introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework,
ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process
(manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task
ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates
meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and
uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device
inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks,
ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on
hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on
simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and
halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a
practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for
computer control.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前医学基准测试存在严重问题，大型前沿模型虽然在基准测试中得分很高，但实际上存在脆弱性、猜测行为和推理缺陷，这些基准测试奖励的是应试技巧而非真正的医学理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前医学AI基准测试的局限性，证明高基准分数并不能真实反映模型在现实医疗环境中的可靠性和准备程度。

Method: 对六个旗舰模型在六个广泛使用的医学基准上进行压力测试，包括移除关键输入、改变提示词等，并通过临床医生指导的评估标准进行分析。

Result: 发现模型即使在关键输入被移除时也能正确猜测，在微小提示变化下会改变答案，并生成看似合理但有缺陷的推理，基准测试测量内容差异很大但被等同对待。

Conclusion: 医学基准测试分数不能直接反映现实世界准备度，AI要在医疗领域获得信任，需要超越基准测试胜利，要求系统具备稳健性、合理推理能力并与真实医疗需求对齐。

Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical
benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often
guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers
under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning.
These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking
tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six
widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness
and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that
benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated
interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark
scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn
trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold
systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real
medical demands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时计算扩展虽然能通过生成长链思维序列提高推理模型性能，但计算成本显著增加。需要探索在计算约束下保持模型性能和安全性的方法。

Method: 1）使用基于长度控制策略优化的强化学习方法微调推理模型，满足用户定义的推理长度；2）应用量化技术，在用户定义的计算约束下最大化生成链式思维序列。

Result: 研究了计算效率与模型安全性之间的权衡关系，探索了在计算约束条件下如何优化推理模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 计算约束策略（长度约束和量化）是减少推理模型计算需求的有效方法，但需要在计算效率和安全性之间找到平衡点。

Abstract: Test-time compute scaling has demonstrated the ability to improve the
performance of reasoning language models by generating longer chain-of-thought
(CoT) sequences. However, this increase in performance comes with a significant
increase in computational cost. In this work, we investigate two compute
constraint strategies: (1) reasoning length constraint and (2) model
quantization, as methods to reduce the compute demand of reasoning models and
study their impact on their safety performance. Specifically, we explore two
approaches to apply compute constraints to reasoning models: (1) fine-tuning
reasoning models using a length controlled policy optimization (LCPO) based
reinforcement learning method to satisfy a user-defined CoT reasoning length,
and (2) applying quantization to maximize the generation of CoT sequences
within a user-defined compute constraint. Furthermore, we study the trade-off
between the computational efficiency and the safety of the model.

Motivation: 尽管前沿AI模型在高中数学竞赛中表现出色，但它们在更高级数学领域解决新猜想的能力尚不明确。作者希望通过Gödel测试来评估模型在数学推理方面的真实能力。

Method: 作者选择了五个组合优化中的未解决猜想，为每个问题提供相关论文但不透露自己的猜想，然后详细评估GPT-5的推理过程。

Result: 在三个较简单问题上，GPT-5几乎给出了正确解；在问题2中甚至推翻了作者的猜想并提供了有效解；但在需要跨论文综合的问题4上失败；在更复杂的问题5上提出了正确算法但分析失败。

Conclusion: GPT-5在常规推理方面有显著进步，偶尔展现出原创性，但在跨论文综合方面仍有明显局限。这可能标志着前沿模型向通过Gödel测试迈出了早期步伐。

results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains
unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more
advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether
a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved
conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures
in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source
papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then
assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5
produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different
approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while
providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required
combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a
validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but
failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected.
Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on
routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations
when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step
toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.

### [268] [ATLAS: Benchmarking and Adapting LLMs for Global Trade via Harmonized Tariff Code Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18400)
*Pritish Yuvraj,Siva Devarakonda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个HTS编码分类基准，并开发了基于LLaMA-3.3-70B的Atlas模型，在10位和6位分类准确率上显著优于GPT-5和Gemini模型，同时成本更低且支持本地部署保障数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTS编码分类是全球贸易中的关键瓶颈，但机器学习社区对此关注不足。错误分类会导致货物运输中断，主要邮政运营商曾因海关文件不完整而暂停对美发货。

Method: 基于美国海关在线搜索系统(CROSS)构建首个HTS编码分类基准，对领先LLM进行评估，并微调Atlas模型(基于LLaMA-3.3-70B)。

Result: 微调的Atlas模型在10位分类准确率达到40%，6位分类准确率达到57.5%，分别比GPT-5-Thinking和Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking高出15个和27.5个百分点。Atlas成本约为GPT-5的1/5、Gemini的1/8，且可本地部署。

Conclusion: Atlas模型为HTS分类设立了强基线，但该基准仍具挑战性(10位准确率仅40%)。通过发布数据集和模型，旨在将HTS分类定位为新的社区基准任务，促进检索、推理和对齐方面的未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate classification of products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) is a critical bottleneck in global trade, yet it has received little
attention from the machine learning community. Misclassification can halt
shipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the
U.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark
for HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online
Search System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned
Atlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit
classifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements
of 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking.
Beyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and
eight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to
guarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While
Atlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with
only 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim
to position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite
future work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment.

*Nikolai Skripko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IFEval-FC是一个新的函数调用基准测试，专注于评估大语言模型对参数描述中格式指令的遵循能力，而不仅仅是参数正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试（如BFCL、tau^2-Bench、ACEBench）只评估参数正确性，但忽略了格式指令遵循这一关键能力，这在现实AI代理系统中很重要。

Method: 在JSON schema描述中直接编码可验证的格式要求（如禁止标点符号），包含750个测试用例，每个用例包含一个函数和对应的用户查询，采用全算法评估确保客观性。

Result: 即使是GPT-5和Claude 4.1 Opus等最先进的专有模型也经常无法遵循基本格式规则，揭示了现实世界代理系统的实际限制。

Conclusion: 格式指令遵循是函数调用的重要能力，IFEval-FC填补了现有基准测试的空白，相关代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Function calling is a core capability of large language models, essential for
AI agents. Existing benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), tau^2-Bench (arXiv:2506.07982), and ACEBench
(arXiv:2501.12851) evaluate argument correctness but do not test adherence to
format instructions embedded in parameter descriptions, such as enclosing
values in double quotes or using ISO date formats.
  We introduce IFEval-FC, a benchmark inspired by IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911)
that assesses precise instruction following in function calling. IFEval-FC
encodes verifiable formats directly within JSON schema descriptions, for
example specifying that a value must not contain punctuation. It includes 750
test cases, each consisting of a function with an embedded format for one of
its input parameters and a corresponding user query. Evaluation is fully
algorithmic, ensuring objectivity, reproducibility, and scalability.
  Our results show that even state-of-the-art proprietary models, including
GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 Opus, frequently fail to follow basic formatting rules,
highlighting a practical limitation for real-world agent systems. The complete
codebase and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: Memory-QA是一个新颖的视觉记忆问答任务，需要从多模态记忆中回答回忆性问题。Pensieve管道通过记忆增强、时空感知检索和多记忆QA微调来解决这一挑战，在QA准确率上比现有方法提升高达14%。


<details>

Motivation: 解决从视觉记忆中回答回忆性问题的现实挑战，包括任务导向记忆创建、时空信息利用以及多记忆推理能力。

Method: 提出Pensieve管道，包含记忆特定增强、时空感知多信号检索和多记忆QA微调三个核心组件。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，Pensieve相比最先进方法在QA准确率上提升高达14%。

Conclusion: Memory-QA任务具有重要现实意义，Pensieve方法有效解决了该任务的核心挑战，为视觉记忆问答领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Memory-QA, a novel real-world task that involves answering
recall questions about visual content from previously stored multimodal
memories. This task poses unique challenges, including the creation of
task-oriented memories, the effective utilization of temporal and location
information within memories, and the ability to draw upon multiple memories to
answer a recall question. To address these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive pipeline, Pensieve, integrating memory-specific augmentation,
time- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA
fine-tuning. We created a multimodal benchmark to illustrate various real
challenges in this task, and show the superior performance of Pensieve over
state-of-the-art solutions (up to 14% on QA accuracy).

TL;DR: FERA是一个用于击剑裁判辅助的AI原型系统，通过姿态动作识别和规则推理来解决击剑裁判中的主观判断、人为错误等问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 击剑运动面临裁判主观判断、人为错误、偏见以及在训练环境中裁判资源有限等挑战，需要自动化裁判辅助系统

Method: 系统从视频中提取2D关节位置，进行归一化处理，计算101维运动学特征，使用Transformer进行多标签动作和剑尖分类，并结合基于规则的推理来确定优先权和得分

Result: 在有限的手动标注数据下，5折交叉验证的平均macro-F1得分为0.549，优于TCN、BiLSTM和普通Transformer等多个基线模型

Conclusion: 虽然尚未达到部署水平，但结果显示了在击剑裁判自动化辅助方面的可行前景，并为AI在击剑领域的应用（如教练辅助）开辟了新机会

Abstract: The sport of fencing, like many other sports, faces challenges in refereeing:
subjective calls, human errors, bias, and limited availability in practice
environments. We present FERA (Fencing Referee Assistant), a prototype AI
referee for foil fencing which integrates pose-based multi-label action
recognition and rule-based reasoning. FERA extracts 2D joint positions from
video, normalizes them, computes a 101-dimensional kinematic feature set, and
applies a Transformer for multi-label move and blade classification. To
determine priority and scoring, FERA applies a distilled language model with
encoded right-of-way rules, producing both a decision and an explanation for
each exchange. With limited hand-labeled data, a 5-fold cross-validation
achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.549, outperforming multiple baselines,
including a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BiLSTM, and a vanilla
Transformer. While not ready for deployment, these results demonstrate a
promising path towards automated referee assistance in foil fencing and new
opportunities for AI applications, such as coaching in the field of fencing.

*Tom Pawelek,Raj Patel,Charlotte Crowell,Noorbakhsh Amiri,Sudip Mittal,Shahram Rahimi,Andy Perkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMZ+提出了一种基于提示白名单的防御机制，替代传统的恶意意图检测方法，通过只允许上下文适当的消息与智能LLM交互来增强安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能AI相比传统模型具有更高的安全风险，因为它们拥有对数据源和API工具的特权访问，且依赖AI的非确定性行为，这给操作安全和信息安全带来了重大风险。

Method: 采用提示白名单方法，只允许符合预定义用例和操作边界的上下文适当且安全的消息与智能LLM进行交互。

Result: 实证评估显示LLMZ+对最常见的越狱提示具有强大的抵抗力，同时不影响合法的业务通信，在实验环境中误报率和漏报率均可降至0。

Conclusion: LLMZ+方法简化了安全框架，增强了长期韧性，并减少了维持LLM信息安全所需的资源，为智能LLM安全提供了有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable
target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data
sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical
agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone
(DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI
(only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This
characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational
security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely
on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent,
thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this
paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond
traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting.
Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are
permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of
context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM
conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach
streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and
reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against
the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business
communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly
between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach
using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to
0 in our experimental setting.

*Mitchell Piehl,Dillon Wilson,Ananya Kalita,Jugal Kalita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法，通过分解数学应用题生成方程，使用外部符号方程求解器获得答案，并通过二次估算验证来提高LLMs解决数学应用题的能力，在多个数据集上取得了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在解决数学应用题方面存在困难，因为需要复杂的推理和数学能力。现有方法虽然有所改进，但仍需更可靠的验证机制来确保答案准确性。

Method: 首先提示LLM从问题分解中创建方程，使用外部符号方程求解器生成答案；然后让LLM第二次估算正确答案，通过比较估算值和生成值进行验证；如果验证失败，采用迭代修正过程。

Result: 该方法在数值和代数数学应用题数据集上比之前最佳结果平均提高了近2%，在三角函数应用题上也取得了满意结果，并引入了两个新数据集SVAMPClean和Trig300。

Conclusion: 提出的双重验证方法显著提高了LLMs解决数学应用题的准确性和可靠性，为测试LLMs推理能力提供了新的基准数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including
problem-solving and question-answering. However, LLMs often find Math Word
Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning
and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts
have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study
proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from
a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic
equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained
answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is
instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of
estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is
then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an
iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is
eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on
datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs,
improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In
addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a
task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge. This study also
introduces two new datasets, SVAMPClean and Trig300, to further advance the
testing of LLMs' reasoning abilities.

*Yara Mohajerani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合地理空间建模与进化学习的新型气候风险评估框架，通过代理模型模拟经济系统对气候灾害的适应性反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统气候风险评估难以捕捉空间异质性灾害与适应性经济系统之间的复杂相互作用，需要开发能够整合气候灾害数据和经济主体学习行为的综合模型。

Method: 开发了基于Mesa的地理空间代理模型，整合CLIMADA气候影响评估，引入进化学习机制让企业通过适应度选择和突变来优化预算分配、定价、工资和风险适应策略。

Result: 使用RCP8.5情景下的河流洪水预测至2100年，显示进化适应使企业能够在数十年气候压力干扰后恢复到基准生产水平，但未直接暴露于洪水的企业仍会通过供应链中断受到影响，世纪末商品平均价格比基准高5.6%。

Conclusion: 该开源框架为金融机构和企业提供了量化直接和级联气候风险的工具，同时能够评估成本效益最优的适应策略。

Abstract: Climate risk assessment requires modelling complex interactions between
spatially heterogeneous hazards and adaptive economic systems. We present a
novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with
evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines Mesa-based
spatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive
learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget
allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection
and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections
under RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to
converge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of
disruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even
agents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply
chain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher
under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline. This open-source framework provides
financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and
cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图RAG系统忽视了LLM令牌使用的高昂成本，阻碍了大规模应用。需要开发成本效益更高的图构建方法。

Method: 受HippoRAG启发，在检索阶段引入个性化PageRank(PPR)，以更低的令牌消耗构建信息丰富的图结构。

Result: TERAG仅消耗3%-11%的输出令牌，就能达到广泛使用的图RAG方法至少80%的准确率。

Conclusion: TERAG证明了在显著降低计算成本的同时，仍能保持图RAG系统良好性能的可行性，为大规模应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely studied
approach for improving the reasoning, accuracy, and factuality of Large
Language Models. However, many existing graph-based RAG systems overlook the
high cost associated with LLM token usage during graph construction, hindering
large-scale adoption. To address this, we propose TERAG, a simple yet effective
framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost.
Inspired by HippoRAG, we incorporate Personalized PageRank (PPR) during the
retrieval phase, and we achieve at least 80% of the accuracy of widely used
graph-based RAG methods while consuming only 3%-11% of the output tokens.

Motivation: 随着机器学习在航空系统中的潜在应用增加，确保其安全性和符合监管要求变得至关重要。EASA和EUROCAE/SAE等机构已发布相关指导文件，但需要更具体的方法来验证ML模型在目标环境中的性能。

Method: 论文首先澄清了ML模型与其明确描述（MLMD）之间的区别，然后细化了语义保持的概念，以确保模型能够准确复制。最后，通过多个工业用例来构建和比较不同的目标模型。

Result: 通过应用提出的方法，论文展示了如何在不同工业用例中构建和比较目标模型，验证了语义保持在确保模型准确复制中的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文强调了ML模型与其明确描述的区别以及语义保持在确保模型安全性和符合监管要求中的重要性，为ML在航空系统中的安全应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) may offer new capabilities in airborne systems.
However, as any piece of airborne systems, ML-based systems will be required to
guarantee their safe operation. Thus, their development will have to be
demonstrated to be compliant with the adequate guidance. So far, the European
Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published a concept paper and an
EUROCAE/SAE group is preparing ED-324. Both approaches delineate high-level
objectives to confirm the ML model achieves its intended function and maintains
training performance in the target environment. The paper aims to clarify the
difference between an ML model and its corresponding unambiguous description,
referred to as the Machine Learning Model Description (MLMD). It then refines
the essential notion of semantics preservation to ensure the accurate
replication of the model. We apply our contributions to several industrial use
cases to build and compare several target models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据规模和复杂性的增长，数据准备、转换和分析工作仍然劳动密集且难以扩展。数据与AI之间的对齐至关重要，但现有数据往往不适合AI直接利用。

Method: DataAgents通过动态规划工作流、调用强大工具并适应多样化数据任务，能够处理数据收集、集成、预处理、选择、转换、重加权、增强、重编程、修复和检索等操作。

Result: DataAgents代表了向自主数据到知识系统的范式转变，能够将复杂非结构化数据转化为连贯可操作的知识。

Conclusion: 需要协同努力推进行动工作流优化、建立开放数据集和基准生态系统、保障隐私、平衡效率与可扩展性，并开发可信的DataAgent防护机制以防止恶意行为。

Abstract: As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming,
and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale.
Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment
between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways
that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises:
how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations?
Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task
decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can
autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks,
reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and
execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools,
DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to
diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a
paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are
capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection,
transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and
retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and
unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why
the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a
critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their
architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and
capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance
action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems,
safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy
DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通过扩大模型规模、训练数据和计算能力的方法已接近饱和，人类生成文本资源耗尽，进一步增益有限

Method: 经验扩展框架：捕获原始交互→提炼为紧凑可重用知识→定期优化存储内容以保持相关性和效率

Result: 在模拟真实场景中验证，经验扩展提高了准确性，维持了长期性能，并在新情境中保持增益

Conclusion: 结构化部署后学习能够扩展LLM能力，超越静态人类生成数据的限制，为持续智能进步提供可扩展路径

Abstract: Scaling model size, training data, and compute power have driven advances in
large language models (LLMs), but these approaches are reaching saturation as
human-generated text is exhausted and further gains diminish. We propose
experience scaling, a framework for continuous post-deployment evolution for
LLMs through autonomous interaction with the environment and collaborative
sharing of accumulated experience. The framework captures raw interactions,
distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored
content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in
simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen
but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores.
Across all settings, experience scaling improves accuracy, sustains performance
over time, and maintains gains when applied to novel situations. These results
demonstrate that structured post-deployment learning can extend LLM
capabilities beyond the limits of static human-generated data, offering a
scalable path for continued intelligence progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构多代理系统中代理能力发现、元数据管理和来源验证的挑战，提供标准化、可扩展的代理注册和互操作性解决方案。

Method: 基于Open Agentic Schema Framework构建，采用两级映射的Kademlia分布式哈希表，复用OCI/ORAS基础设施进行工件分发，集成Sigstore进行来源验证，支持模式驱动的可扩展性。

Result: 设计了一个支持高效、可验证、多维发现的分布式目录架构，能够处理新兴代理模式（如LLM提示代理、MCP服务器、A2A组件）。

Conclusion: ADS为新兴代理注册和互操作性倡议提供了重要的架构模型，具有安全性和性能优势，是异构多代理系统能力发现的关键基础设施。

Abstract: The Agent Directory Service (ADS) is a distributed directory for the
discovery of AI agent capabilities, metadata, and provenance. It leverages
content-addressed storage, hierarchical taxonomies, and cryptographic signing
to enable efficient, verifiable, and multi-dimensional discovery across
heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Built on the Open Agentic Schema
Framework (OASF), ADS decouples capability indexing from content location
through a two-level mapping realized over a Kademlia-based Distributed Hash
Table (DHT). It reuses mature OCI / ORAS infrastructure for artifact
distribution, integrates Sigstore for provenance, and supports schema-driven
extensibility for emerging agent modalities (LLM prompt agents, MCP servers,
A2A-enabled components). This paper formalizes the architectural model,
describes storage and discovery layers, explains security and performance
properties, and positions ADS within the broader landscape of emerging agent
registry and interoperability initiatives.

Motivation: 现有LLM文本生成过程缺乏形式化验证方法，无法保证生成文本的一致性和可靠性。研究旨在开发首个基于PCTL模型检查的LLM验证框架。

Method: 提出α-k有界文本生成方法：在每个生成步骤中，仅考虑累积概率超过阈值α的top-k令牌。LLMCHECKER利用该方法构建有限状态模型，然后应用PCTL模型检查技术进行形式化验证。

Result: 方法在多个LLM模型(Llama、Gemma、Mistral、Genstruct、BERT)上得到验证，能够有效评估文本质量和偏见等量化指标。

Conclusion: LLMCHECKER是首个将PCTL模型检查应用于LLM文本生成过程验证的方法，为LLM的可靠性和一致性提供了形式化保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification
method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of
an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number
of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the
same. This insight drives the creation of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded text generation,
narrowing the focus to the $\alpha$ maximal cumulative probability on the
top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification
method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while
accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text
quality and biases. The threshold $\alpha$ further reduces the selected tokens,
only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability.
LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of
$\alpha$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in
several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our
knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to
check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.

TL;DR: 提出一个模块化框架用于ICD-10-CM编码预测，通过系统化模型选择、冗余感知数据采样和结构化输入设计，提高大型语言模型在医疗编码任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICD编码是临床文档、计费和医疗分析的关键任务，但当前仍依赖人工且容易出错。虽然大型语言模型在自动化ICD编码方面有潜力，但在基础模型选择、输入上下文化和训练数据冗余方面存在挑战。

Method: 开发模块化框架，包括：1）使用LLM-as-judge评估协议和Plackett-Luce聚合来评估开源LLM对ICD-10-CM代码定义的理解；2）引入基于嵌入的相似性度量和冗余感知采样策略；3）利用台湾医院的结构化出院摘要评估上下文效应。

Result: 在两个机构数据集上的实验表明，经过微调的基础模型在内部和外部评估中始终优于基线LLM。包含更多临床部分持续提高预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究使用开源LLM建立了一个实用且原则性的ICD-10-CM编码预测方法，通过结合信息化的模型选择、高效数据细化和上下文感知提示，为自动化医疗编码系统的实际部署提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is critical
for clinical documentation, billing, and healthcare analytics, yet it remains a
labour-intensive and error-prone task. Although large language models (LLMs)
show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model
selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their
effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification
(ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled
model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design.
The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce
aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic
comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based
similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove
semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge
summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine
section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling
paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the
selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in
internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections
consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs
to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for
real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed
model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为混合优势策略优化（MAPO）的新方法，解决了GRPO中存在的优势反转和优势镜像问题，通过动态重新加权优势函数来适应不同轨迹确定性的样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法在优势函数分配上存在优势反转和优势镜像问题，阻碍了不同查询样本间合理的优势分配。

Method: 提出MAPO方法，引入优势百分比偏差来处理高确定性轨迹样本，并动态重新加权优势函数以适应不同轨迹确定性的样本。

Result: 与相关最先进方法的比较以及不同优势变体的消融研究验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPO是一种简单但有效的GRPO策略，能够自适应地配置优势函数以考虑样本特定特征。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the
performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage
function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory
importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion
and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation
across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective
GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the
trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent
deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we
dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory
certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for
sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art
methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates
the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了ProfileBench基准和Conf-Profile框架，用于解决用户画像任务中标注数据稀缺和异构噪声数据的问题，通过置信度驱动的两阶段训练显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户画像作为用户理解的核心技术，需要从用户信息中推断结构化属性。虽然大语言模型为此提供了有前景的途径，但缺乏全面基准和标注数据稀缺的问题阻碍了进展。

Method: 提出Conf-Profile框架，采用两阶段范式：1）利用带置信度提示的先进LLM合成高质量标签，通过置信度加权投票和校准；2）通过置信度引导的无监督强化学习增强推理能力，包括难度过滤、准真实标签投票和奖励加权。

Result: 实验结果表明，Conf-Profile通过两阶段训练实现了显著性能提升，在Qwen3-8B模型上F1分数提高了13.97。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了用户画像任务中的标注数据稀缺和噪声数据问题，为标签无关且可靠的用户画像提供了可行方案。

Abstract: User profiling, as a core technique for user understanding, aims to infer
structural attributes from user information. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by
the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform,
encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy.
However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of
collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy
user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free
and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning
framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize
high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed
by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence
calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results,
rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a
lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided
unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty
filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental
results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through
the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的LLM记忆定义和四部分分类法（参数化、上下文、外部、程序/情景记忆），建立了记忆四元组框架，并开发了分层评估协议和治理系统DMM Gov，为LLM记忆研究提供了可复现、可比较和可治理的坐标系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM记忆研究缺乏统一的定义、分类和评估标准，导致不同设置下的比较失真，需要建立系统性的框架来整合机制、评估和治理。

Method: 提出记忆四元组（位置、持久性、写入/访问路径、可控性），采用三设置协议（仅参数、离线检索、在线检索）解耦能力与信息可用性，构建分层评估体系，并开发DMM Gov治理系统协调多种技术。

Result: 建立了完整的LLM记忆评估框架，包括参数化记忆测试、上下文记忆分析、外部记忆验证和程序/情景记忆评估，整合了时间治理、泄漏审计和不确定性报告。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM记忆研究提供了系统性的方法论，支持可复现的比较和有效的治理，提出了四个可测试的命题，推动了该领域的标准化发展。

Abstract: Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent
state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be
addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy
(parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple
(location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism,
evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To
avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a
three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval)
that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and
timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book
recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves
and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet
attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency
and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and
leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and
uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with
multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM
Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC),
and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout,
monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict
handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable
propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally
constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with
small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a
reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and
deployment.

Conclusion: LongCat-Flash-Thinking展示了高效推理模型的可行性，为推理系统和代理AI研究提供了重要进展，模型已开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter
open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities
are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with
long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale
Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start
training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and
equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning.
Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples
optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and
subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly
Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic
ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL
framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over
synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result,
LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional
efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5%
(from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We
release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems

Conclusion: 研究揭示了实现空间智能面临的重大挑战，同时提供了系统性路线图和全面基准，为未来研究指明方向。相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) is a core human cognitive ability and a
critical requirement for advancing embodied intelligence and autonomous
systems. Despite recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving
human-level VSR remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
representing and reasoning over three-dimensional space. In this paper, we
present a systematic investigation of VSR in VLMs, encompassing a review of
existing methodologies across input modalities, model architectures, training
strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, we categorize spatial
intelligence into three levels of capability, ie, basic perception, spatial
understanding, spatial planning, and curate SIBench, a spatial intelligence
benchmark encompassing nearly 20 open-source datasets across 23 task settings.
Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a pronounced gap between
perception and reasoning, as models show competence in basic perceptual tasks
but consistently underperform in understanding and planning tasks, particularly
in numerical estimation, multi-view reasoning, temporal dynamics, and spatial
imagination. These findings underscore the substantial challenges that remain
in achieving spatial intelligence, while providing both a systematic roadmap
and a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in the field. The

Motivation: 传统微调方法存在灾难性遗忘和数据效率低下的问题，限制了LLMs在实际应用中的适用性。

Method: 提出DEAL框架，整合LoRA与持续微调策略，包含知识保留和自适应参数更新模块，在保护隐私设置下保持效率。

Result: 在15个不同数据集上的实验表明，DEAL在任务准确性和资源效率方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提升任务性能和资源效率，展现了在LLMs中推进持续适应的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the
critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific
tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible.
Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing
models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications.
However, con- ventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting
and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes DEAL, a novel framework that
integrates Low-Rank Adapta- tion (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy.
By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the
framework mitigates the lim- itations of existing FT methods while maintaining
efficiency in privacy-preserving settings. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets
show that DEAL consistently outper- forms baseline methods, yielding
substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in
LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

Abstract: Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like
cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being
deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education,
scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable
potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which
can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the
overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep
understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based
agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of
hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete
workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types
of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct
an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence
of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of
existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and
detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this
survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in
LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and
reliable agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释AI研究多依赖自动评估指标，但这些指标往往无法捕捉用户的实际需求和感知，因此需要采用用户中心的方法来评估解释质量。

Method: 使用基于约束矩阵分解的可解释推荐模型，通过精心设计的LLM提示将模型结构转化为自然语言解释，并在326名参与者中进行用户研究，评估五种关键维度的解释质量。

Result: 所有解释类型都受到良好接受，不同策略之间存在中等统计差异，用户评论提供了定量结果之外的补充见解。

Conclusion: LLM能够从可解释推荐模型生成有效的用户导向解释，用户中心评估方法为解释质量提供了更全面的理解。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective,
user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation
model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types
are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as
observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted
scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural
language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in
explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to
capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a
user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed
the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency,
effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the
recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are
perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying
model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals
that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate
statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore
how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary
insights beyond the quantitative results.

Method: 在物流公司提供的包含169,523条轨迹的新颖事件日志上，比较了四种剩余时间预测方法，包括深度学习模型和浅层方法如传统提升技术。

Result: 深度学习模型达到最高精度，但浅层方法如传统提升技术获得竞争性精度，且需要显著更少的计算资源。

Conclusion: 虽然深度学习在精度上表现最佳，但浅层方法在精度和计算效率之间提供了更好的平衡，对于资源受限的环境更具实用性。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring is a sub-domain of process mining which aims to
forecast the future of ongoing process executions. One common prediction target
is the remaining time, meaning the time that will elapse until a process
execution is completed. In this paper, we compare four different remaining time
prediction approaches in a real-life outbound warehouse process of a logistics
company in the aviation business. For this process, the company provided us
with a novel and original event log with 169,523 traces, which we can make
publicly available. Unsurprisingly, we find that deep learning models achieve
the highest accuracy, but shallow methods like conventional boosting techniques
achieve competitive accuracy and require significantly fewer computational
resources.

Abstract: Algorithmic evaluation of procedurally generated content struggles to find
metrics that align with human experience, particularly for composite artefacts.
Automatic decomposition as a possible solution requires concepts that meet a
range of properties. To this end, drawing on Games Studies and Game AI
research, we introduce the nested concepts of \textit{Landmarks},
\textit{Monuments}, and \textit{Beacons}. These concepts are based on the
artefact's perceivability, evocativeness, and Call to Action, all from a
player-centric perspective. These terms are generic to games and usable across
genres. We argue that these entities can be found and evaluated with techniques
currently used in both research and industry, opening a path towards a fully
automated decomposition of PCG, and evaluation of the salient sub-components.
Although the work presented here emphasises mixed-initiative PCG and
compositional PCG, we believe it applies beyond those domains. With this
approach, we intend to create a connection between humanities and technical
game research and allow for better computational PCG evaluation

Conclusion: 通过将可观测源作为辅助变量，该框架为因果表示学习提供了新的识别途径，特别是在已知潜在因果图的情况下能够有效恢复潜在因子。

Abstract: Causal representation learning seeks to recover latent factors that generate
observational data through a mixing function. Needing assumptions on latent
structures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works
often build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables.
However, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external
to the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can
be easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating
identification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources
being auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables. Our main
results show that one can identify entire latent variables up to subspace-wise
transformations and permutations using volume-preserving encoders. Moreover,
when multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a
variable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the
latent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on synthetic
graph and image data, thereby extending the boundaries of current approaches.

TL;DR: CoPiC是一种基于代码驱动规划和领域自适应批评器的LLM规划方法，通过生成多样化高级规划程序来减少频繁查询成本，同时使用训练好的批评器选择与长期奖励对齐的最佳计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划方法依赖频繁查询和环境反馈进行迭代优化，导致高查询成本且难以实现长期奖励对齐。需要一种既能减少查询次数又能考虑长期收益的规划方法。

Method: 使用LLM生成多样化高级规划程序，这些程序迭代产生和优化候选计划；训练一个领域自适应批评器来评估候选计划并选择与长期奖励最匹配的计划执行。

Result: 在ALFWorld、NetHack和StarCraft II Unit Building三个环境中，CoPiC相比先进LLM基线方法（AdaPlanner和Reflexion）平均提升23.33%的成功率，同时减少91.27%的查询成本。

Conclusion: CoPiC通过结合代码驱动规划和领域自适应批评器，有效解决了LLM规划中的查询成本高和长期奖励对齐问题，在多个复杂环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI
agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world
knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and
environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address
this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine
plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query
costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental
feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards.
We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of
relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of
high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate
plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and
selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using
high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as
estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs.
Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC
outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving
an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in
query costs.

TL;DR: AgentInit是一种多智能体系统初始化方法，通过优化智能体团队结构来提升系统性能，结合自然语言到格式转换机制和帕累托平衡选择策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAS初始化方法未能充分考虑智能体在后续阶段的协作需求，需要更有效的团队组成原则来提升系统效率和效果。

Method: AgentInit采用多轮智能体交互和反思，引入自然语言到格式转换机制确保一致性，应用帕累托原则进行平衡团队选择，同时考虑团队多样性和任务相关性。

Result: 实验表明AgentInit在各种框架和任务中均优于现有初始化方法和预定义策略，性能提升分别达1.2和1.6倍，同时显著降低token消耗。

Conclusion: AgentInit具有良好的可迁移性和适应性，其关键组件有效性得到验证，可作为可靠的MAS初始化方法。

Abstract: Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent
systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's
efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do
not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in
subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we
propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams.
Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between
agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to
Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team
selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to
jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective
and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments
show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization
methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks,
achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6,
respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further
analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the
effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and
adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method. Source code and models

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在阿拉伯世界的跨文化常识推理迁移能力，发现仅需少量文化特定示例即可显著提升模型在其他文化背景下的表现，证明了高效跨文化对齐的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常存在西方中心偏见，限制了其在多元文化背景下的有效性。虽然已有研究探索文化对齐，但跨文化迁移的潜力（利用一种文化的对齐来提升其他文化性能）仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用覆盖13个阿拉伯国家的文化基础常识推理数据集，评估轻量级对齐方法（上下文学习、演示强化DITTO）以及基线方法（监督微调、直接偏好优化）。

Result: 仅需12个来自一个国家的文化特定示例，即可在多语言模型中平均提升其他国家的性能10%。来自印尼和美国等非阿拉伯文化的演示也能匹配或超越阿拉伯文化内的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 高效的跨文化对齐是可行的，这为将LLMs适配到低资源文化环境提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting
their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has
explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using
alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains
underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense
reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities
coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded
commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate
lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and
demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised
fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12
culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by
10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that
out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or
surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural
commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate
that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising
approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了零样本深度伪造检测技术，研究了自监督学习、基于Transformer的零样本分类器、生成模型指纹识别和元学习等方法，并提出了AI驱动的预防策略，包括对抗性扰动、数字水印、实时AI监控和区块链验证框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成对抗网络（GANs）和扩散模型显著推动了深度伪造技术的发展，对数字安全、媒体完整性和公众信任的威胁日益增加，需要开发能够应对不断演变的深度伪造威胁的检测和预防方法。

Method: 采用自监督学习、基于Transformer的零样本分类器、生成模型指纹识别和元学习技术，结合对抗性扰动、数字水印、实时AI监控和区块链验证等预防策略。

Result: 提出了零样本检测和预防的集成防御框架，但面临对抗性攻击、可扩展性限制、伦理困境和缺乏标准化评估基准等挑战。

Conclusion: 需要结合零样本学习和预防机制的综合防御框架，并强调AI研究人员、网络安全专家和政策制定者之间的跨学科合作对于构建抵御深度伪造攻击的弹性防御体系的重要性。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically
advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media
integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored
zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have
never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied
self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative
model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the
ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention
strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes
before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating
deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity
verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and
blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements,
zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as
adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence
of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by
discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection,
multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for
enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake
detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense
framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in
combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the
important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers,
cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against
the rising tide of deepfake attacks.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯面元的高效可微分光传输框架，结合辐射度理论，在球谐系数空间中实现全局光照效果，解决了传统辐射场方法在材质反射特性和光照建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统辐射场方法牺牲了材质反射特性和光照条件的建模，导致几何模糊和无法进行重光照。现有方法在优化过程中包含全局光照效果时计算成本过高，或者采用简化方法导致精度不足。

Method: 采用高斯面元作为基元，在球谐系数空间中构建可微分光传输框架，扩展经典辐射度理论以支持非二元可见性和半透明基元，提出高效求解器并推导梯度优化的反向传播过程。

Result: 实现了视图无关渲染，在视角变化时无需重新计算光传输，支持包含视图相关反射的全局光照效果，达到数百FPS的渲染速度。在几何重建、视图合成和重光照方面优于现有逆向渲染基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏数据集下，无论是已知还是未知光照条件，都能实现高质量的几何重建、视图合成和重光照效果，为辐射场方法提供了更完整的光照和材质建模能力。

Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from
novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of
Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective
properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric
ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address
these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been
prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner
loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that
make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less
accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build
an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the
classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space
of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend
the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives,
propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the
backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than
auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering
where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling
hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent
reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry
reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering
baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known
or unknown lighting conditions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Text Slider是一个轻量级、高效的即插即用框架，通过识别预训练文本编码器中的低秩方向，实现对视觉概念的连续控制，显著减少训练时间、GPU内存消耗和可训练参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念控制方法需要大量训练时间和GPU内存来学习滑块或嵌入，且需要为不同的扩散骨干网络重新训练，限制了其可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 在预训练文本编码器中识别低秩方向，实现连续控制视觉概念，支持多概念组合和连续控制。

Result: Text Slider实现了平滑连续的概念属性调制，同时保持输入的空间布局和结构。训练速度比Concept Slider快5倍，比Attribute Control快47倍，GPU内存使用分别减少近2倍和4倍。

Conclusion: Text Slider是一个高效、轻量级的解决方案，解决了现有概念控制方法的训练效率低和适应性差的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and
video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been
proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over
free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive
training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also
need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their
scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text
Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies
low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous
control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU
memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text
Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling
fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We
show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific
attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the
input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster
training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control,
while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$,
respectively.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques,
and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform
retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style
transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is
becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized
by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties,
which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore
the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel
contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content
features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of
image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and
then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of
pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture
fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the
whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from
content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to
further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation.
Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with
only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer,
we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior
methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three
additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and
appearance transfer.
