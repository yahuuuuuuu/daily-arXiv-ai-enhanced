### [1] [PolypSeg-GradCAM: Towards Explainable Computer-Aided Gastrointestinal Disease Detection Using U-Net Based Segmentation and Grad-CAM Visualization on the Kvasir Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18159)
*Akwasi Asare,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PolypSeg-GradCAM框架，将U-Net与Grad-CAM结合，实现可解释的息肉分割，在Kvasir-SEG数据集上达到高精度分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌是全球主要癌症死因之一，息肉是重要前兆。现有深度学习分割方法缺乏可解释性，阻碍临床应用。

Method: 集成U-Net架构和梯度加权类激活映射(Grad-CAM)，在1000张标注内镜图像数据集上训练评估。

Result: 测试集平均IoU达0.9257，训练和验证集Dice系数均高于0.96，Grad-CAM可视化证实预测基于临床相关区域。

Conclusion: PolypSeg-GradCAM结合高精度分割和可解释性，为可靠AI辅助结肠镜检查和早期结直肠癌预防迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as
critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and
accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing
CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to
observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential
for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a
barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an
explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp
segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of
1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust
segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96)
on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that
predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency
and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with
interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable,
trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer
prevention.

*Sherwin Bahmani,Tianchang Shen,Jiawei Ren,Jiahui Huang,Yifeng Jiang,Haithem Turki,Andrea Tagliasacchi,David B. Lindell,Zan Gojcic,Sanja Fidler,Huan Ling,Jun Gao,Xuanchi Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自蒸馏框架，将视频扩散模型中的隐式3D知识蒸馏到显式的3D高斯泼溅表示中，无需多视角训练数据即可生成3D场景


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的3D重建方法依赖真实世界多视角数据，但这些数据不易获取。视频扩散模型具有强大的想象力，但其2D特性限制了在机器人导航等需要3D交互的应用

Method: 在RGB解码器基础上增加3DGS解码器，通过RGB解码器的输出进行监督训练。3DGS解码器完全使用视频扩散模型生成的合成数据进行训练

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在静态和动态3D场景生成方面达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该框架能够从文本提示或单张图像实时合成3D场景，并可扩展到从单目输入视频生成动态3D场景

Abstract: The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications
ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods
rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not
always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have
shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the
applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with
the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that
aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an
explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for
multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with
a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this
approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated
by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D
scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our
framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input
video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

### [4] [Self Identity Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18165)
*Xiuding Cai,Yaoyao Zhu,Linjie Fu,Dong Miao,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SIM（Self Identity Mapping）的数据内在正则化框架，通过逆映射机制增强表示学习，减少前向传播中的信息损失并促进梯度流动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化技术通常依赖启发式方法，在不同设置下效果不稳定。需要一种更可靠有效的正则化方法来提高深度学习模型的泛化能力。

Method: SIM框架通过重构输入从其变换输出来实现正则化，具体实现为ρSIM，采用补丁级特征采样和基于投影的方法来重构潜在特征以降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在图像分类、少样本提示学习和领域泛化等任务上，ρSIM相比基线方法都取得了持续改进，证明其能有效增强表示学习能力。

Conclusion: SIM作为一种模型无关、任务无关的正则化器，可以无缝集成到不同网络架构和任务中，且与现有正则化方法正交，能进一步提升其效果。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and
mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on
heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We
propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic
regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance
representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed
output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates
smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate
SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and
projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering
complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be
seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to
different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image
classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization.
Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods,
highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning
across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal
to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our
results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic
information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic
segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including
audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.

### [5] [MAGIA: Sensing Per-Image Signals from Single-Round Averaged Gradients for Label-Inference-Free Gradient Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18170)
*Zhanting Zhou,Jinbo Wang,Zeqin Wu,Fengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIA是一种基于动量的自适应梯度反演攻击方法，能够在单轮平均梯度SAG机制下实现高保真多图像重建，特别是在大批量场景中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在具有挑战性的单轮平均梯度SAG机制下的梯度反演问题，其中每个样本的线索都纠缠在单个批次平均梯度中，需要开发新的方法来感知潜在的每图像信号。

Method: MAGIA框架包含两个核心创新：1）封闭形式组合重缩放，创建可证明更紧的优化边界；2）基于动量的整批和子集损失混合，确保重建鲁棒性。该方法通过探测随机数据子集来感知潜在图像信号，无需标签推断。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAGIA在先进方法失败的大批量场景中显著优于现有技术，实现了高保真多图像重建，且计算开销与标准求解器相当，无需任何辅助信息。

Conclusion: MAGIA为梯度反演攻击提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别是在具有挑战性的SAG机制下，展示了在隐私保护机器学习中的潜在安全风险。

Abstract: We study gradient inversion in the challenging single round averaged gradient
SAG regime where per sample cues are entangled within a single batch mean
gradient. We introduce MAGIA a momentum based adaptive correction on gradient
inversion attack a novel label inference free framework that senses latent per
image signals by probing random data subsets. MAGIA objective integrates two
core innovations 1 a closed form combinatorial rescaling that creates a
provably tighter optimization bound and 2 a momentum based mixing of whole
batch and subset losses to ensure reconstruction robustness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MAGIA significantly outperforms advanced methods
achieving high fidelity multi image reconstruction in large batch scenarios
where prior works fail. This is all accomplished with a computational footprint
comparable to standard solvers and without requiring any auxiliary information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Baseer是一个专门针对阿拉伯语文档OCR的视觉语言模型，通过在大规模数据集上进行微调，显著提升了阿拉伯文档OCR性能，WER达到0.25，超越了现有开源和商业解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语文档OCR面临挑战，包括草书字体、多样化字体、变音符号和从右到左的书写方向。现有的多模态大语言模型在阿拉伯语上的性能有限。

Method: 采用解码器专用微调策略，在结合合成和真实文档的大规模数据集上微调预训练的MLLM，同时保留通用视觉特征。还提出了Misraj-DocOCR基准用于评估。

Result: Baseer显著优于现有的开源和商业解决方案，WER达到0.25，在阿拉伯语文档OCR领域建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，对通用MLLM进行领域特定适配具有显著优势，为像阿拉伯语这样的形态丰富语言的高精度OCR建立了强大基线。

Abstract: Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive
script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding
for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In
this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned
specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset
combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a
decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving
general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality,
expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR
systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing
open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing
a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results
highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs
and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich
languages like Arabic.

### [7] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18176)
*Wendong Yao,Saeed Azadnejad,Binhua Huang,Shane Donohue,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的深度学习框架，将稀疏的InSAR时间序列数据转换为密集的时空张量，首次将先进的计算机视觉架构应用于地面变形预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测地面位移对城市基础设施稳定性和减轻地质灾害至关重要，但从稀疏的InSAR时间序列数据预测未来变形仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 设计并实现了一个混合CNN-LSTM模型，专门用于从生成的数据张量中同时学习空间模式和时间依赖性，并与LightGBM和LASSO回归等基准模型进行比较。

Result: 结果表明，所提出的架构提供了显著更准确和空间一致的预测，为该任务建立了新的性能基准。可解释性分析显示基线模型通常默认使用简单的持续性模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果证实了时空深度学习在高分辨率变形预测中的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability
and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from
sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning
framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense
spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time,
the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this
forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural
Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to
simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the
generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful
machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO
regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate
that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and
spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this
task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models
often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of
our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of
ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of
spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

### [8] [A Framework for Generating Artificial Datasets to Validate Absolute and Relative Position Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18177)
*George Corrêa de Araújo,Helena de Almeida Maia,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scrapbook框架是一种生成大规模数据集的新方法，用于探究AI模型学习的概念理解能力，重点关注物体识别、位置关系和属性识别等基础概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但对其基础概念理解能力的系统性评估不足。需要验证模型对基本元素的理解，然后再处理更复杂任务。

Method: 通过生成包含大量关于单个概念问题和广泛语言变体的数据集，系统性地测试模型对基础概念的理解能力。

Result: 实验发现现代模型在物体识别方面表现良好，但在理解位置信息和处理有额外约束的问题时存在困难。MobileVLM-V2模型显示出显著答案不一致性，其他模型则存在肯定答案偏见，在几何形状和位置信息问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Scrapbook框架为生成多样化数据集提供了有效工具，可用于系统评估和提升AI模型的性能，特别是在基础概念理解方面。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology
designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of
artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental
concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and
attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of
questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the
Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic
elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal
that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and
enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional
information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically,
the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible
wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers
and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional
information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency.
The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and
comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and
enhance the performance of AI models.

### [9] [The Describe-Then-Generate Bottleneck: How VLM Descriptions Alter Image Generation Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18179)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过实证分析量化了视觉-语言-视觉管道中描述-生成瓶颈造成的信息损失，发现99.3%的样本存在显著感知退化，91.5%存在结构信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态AI系统在创意工作流中的集成日益增多，理解视觉-语言-视觉管道中的信息损失对于评估系统局限性变得重要，但目前通过文本中介传递视觉内容时的退化程度仍缺乏量化研究。

Method: 生成了150对图像通过描述-生成管道，并应用现有指标（LPIPS、SSIM和颜色距离）来测量感知、结构和色彩维度上的信息保存情况。

Result: 评估显示99.3%的样本表现出显著的感知退化，91.5%的样本表现出显著的结构信息损失。

Conclusion: 描述-生成瓶颈代表了当代多模态系统中可测量且一致的限制，为系统改进提供了实证基础。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of multimodal AI systems in creative
workflows, understanding information loss in vision-language-vision pipelines
has become important for evaluating system limitations. However, the
degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual
intermediation remains poorly quantified. In this work, we provide empirical
analysis of the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language
serves as an intermediate representation for visual information. We generated
150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied
existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information
preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our
evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual
degradation and 91.5% demonstrate significant structural information loss,
providing empirical evidence that the describe-then-generate bottleneck
represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种AI驱动的工作流程，利用高分辨率卫星图像自动推断屋顶属性，以解决小岛屿发展中国家建筑结构信息缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多气候脆弱地区的小岛屿发展中国家缺乏详细的建筑结构信息，这限制了灾害风险评估和城市韧性规划。

Method: 比较了地理空间基础模型结合浅层分类器与微调深度学习模型在屋顶分类中的效果，并评估了加入邻近岛屿训练数据对模型性能的影响。

Result: 最佳模型在屋顶坡度和屋顶材料分类上分别达到了0.88和0.83的F1分数。

Conclusion: 结合本地能力建设，该工作旨在为小岛屿发展中国家提供利用AI和地球观测数据实现更高效、基于证据的城市治理的新能力。

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage
from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical
for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such
information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS)
in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we
present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from
high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our
case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models
combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for
rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating
additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance.
Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof
material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building,
our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth
Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban
governance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VLA-LPAF轻量模块，通过2D数据增强VLA模型的视角适应性，解决多视角视觉特征差异问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在处理来自不同环境和视角的视觉观察时，由于视角异质性导致视觉特征差异显著，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出VLA-LPAF轻量模块，仅使用单视角图像进行微调，在潜在空间中融合多视角观察，有效桥接视角不一致带来的差距。基于RoboFlamingo模型实例化RoboFlamingo-LPAF框架。

Result: 在CALVIN基准上平均提升约8%任务成功率，LIBERO上提升15%，定制仿真基准上提升30%。真实世界任务验证了模型具有视角自适应特性。

Conclusion: VLA-LPAF能够有效解决VLA模型的视角异质性问题，显著提升模型在多视角环境下的适应性和任务性能。

Abstract: The Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models can follow text instructions
according to visual observations of the surrounding environment. This ability
to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA
model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured
by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in
number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant
differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains
the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the
lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models
using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and
fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and
efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate
our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct
RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves
around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a
customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive
characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.

quantitative evaluations.

Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症常导致慢性盆腔疼痛和可能的神经受累，但周围神经成像仍然是一个挑战

Method: 采用两阶段流程：(A)使用深度学习模型自动分割解剖结构，(B)通过符号空间推理进行纤维束成像和神经识别，利用模糊空间关系编码解剖知识

Conclusion: 这种自动且可重复的方法能够进行详细的神经分析，为非侵入性诊断子宫内膜异位症相关神经病变以及其他神经受累疾病开辟了新途径

Abstract: Endometriosis often leads to chronic pelvic pain and possible nerve
involvement, yet imaging the peripheral nerves remains a challenge. We
introduce Visionerves, a novel hybrid AI framework for peripheral nervous
system recognition from multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. Unlike
conventional tractography, Visionerves encodes anatomical knowledge through
fuzzy spatial relationships, removing the need for selection of manual ROIs.
The pipeline comprises two phases: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical
structures using a deep learning model, and (B) tractography and nerve
recognition by symbolic spatial reasoning. Applied to the lumbosacral plexus in
10 women with (confirmed or suspected) endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated
substantial improvements over standard tractography, with Dice score
improvements of up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5 mm. This
automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and paves
the way for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy, as well
as other conditions with nerve involvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要来自发达国家，缺乏新兴经济体驾驶行为的多样性表示，且驾驶员面部记录侵犯隐私保护。需要能代表巴基斯坦等国家真实驾驶环境的数据集。

Method: 使用定制Android应用程序收集高频率加速度计、陀螺仪和GPS数据，同时记录同步的路面视频，所有数据源精确时间对齐。数据集分为原始层、处理层和语义层。

Result: 创建了包含正常、攻击性和危险三种目标驾驶行为的多模态数据集，覆盖城市主干道、次干道和高速公路等多种道路类型。

Conclusion: V-SenseDrive填补了全球驾驶员行为数据集的关键空白，为情境感知智能交通解决方案奠定了基础。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge, particularly
in countries with heterogeneous road conditions, mixed traffic flow, and
variable driving discipline, such as Pakistan. Reliable detection of unsafe
driving behaviours is a prerequisite for improving road safety, enabling
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and supporting data driven decisions
in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the
developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity
observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the
privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving
multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani
driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS
sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving
behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads,
including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered
using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency
accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all
sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HazeFlow是一个基于ODE的新型去雾框架，将大气散射模型重新表述为常微分方程，通过单步推理实现真实世界图像去雾，解决了传统方法在处理真实复杂雾霾模式时的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法因缺乏配对的真实世界训练数据和领域差距，难以泛化到真实场景。基于大气散射模型的传统方法在处理真实复杂雾霾模式时表现不足。

Method: 提出HazeFlow框架，将大气散射模型重新表述为ODE，学习从雾霾图像到清晰图像的最优ODE轨迹。引入基于马尔可夫链布朗运动的非均匀雾霾生成方法，模拟真实雾霾模式。

Result: 在多个真实世界去雾基准数据集上，HazeFlow实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: HazeFlow通过ODE框架和非均匀雾霾生成方法，有效提升了真实世界图像去雾的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Dehazing involves removing haze or fog from images to restore clarity and
improve visibility by estimating atmospheric scattering effects. While deep
learning methods show promise, the lack of paired real-world training data and
the resulting domain gap hinder generalization to real-world scenarios. In this
context, physics-grounded learning becomes crucial; however, traditional
methods based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) often fall short in
handling real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns. To solve this
problem, we propose HazeFlow, a novel ODE-based framework that reformulates ASM
as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Inspired by Rectified Flow (RF),
HazeFlow learns an optimal ODE trajectory to map hazy images to clean ones,
enhancing real-world dehazing performance with only a single inference step.
Additionally, we introduce a non-homogeneous haze generation method using
Markov Chain Brownian Motion (MCBM) to address the scarcity of paired
real-world data. By simulating realistic haze patterns through MCBM, we enhance
the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学诊断越来越多地使用多模态数据，但现有模型难以有效融合异构信息并处理模态缺失问题，需要开发更鲁棒的多模态学习方法。

Method: 引入可学习的模态token来改进缺失感知的模态融合，并在传统单模态对比目标基础上增加融合多模态表示，结合增强模态dropout和对比学习技术。

Abstract: As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning
models are expected to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while
remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel
multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and
contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality
imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens
for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional
unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We
validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection
and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a
single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through
successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings
highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach
for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with
significant potential for real-world clinical applications. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了9种分割架构在肺栓塞（PE）分割任务上的表现，发现3D U-Net with ResNet编码器效果最佳，CNN模型优于ViT模型，分类预训练可能对分割性能产生负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于肺栓塞分割在临床诊断中的重要性，但缺乏对不同分割架构在PE分割任务上的系统性评估，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用490个CTPA扫描构建内部数据集，在统一测试框架下评估9种CNN和ViT分割架构（包括预训练和随机初始化权重）。

Result: 最佳模型达到0.7131的Dice分数，在60个测试扫描中检测到181个栓子（49个假阳性，28个假阴性）。3D模型和CNN架构表现优于ViT，分类预训练对分割性能有负面影响。

Conclusion: 3D U-Net with ResNet是PE分割的有效架构，远端栓子分割仍具挑战性，PE分类和分割可能依赖于不同的判别特征。

Abstract: In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490
CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used
segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)
families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified
testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important
observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective
architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to
this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based
models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based
counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on
large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to
training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may
rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model
architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when
trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be
segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to
both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these
findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for
segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false
negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further
validated on public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手形在手语中具有基础音系学作用，但计算方法很少显式建模手形，限制了识别准确性和语言分析。

Method: 结合解剖学启发的图结构和对比学习，解决手形识别中的关键挑战，包括细微的类间差异和时间变化。

Result: 在签名序列中建立了首个结构化手形识别基准，达到46%的准确率（基线方法为25%）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了手形识别性能，为手语计算分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Handshapes serve a fundamental phonological role in signed languages, with
American Sign Language employing approximately 50 distinct shapes.
However,computational approaches rarely model handshapes explicitly, limiting
both recognition accuracy and linguistic analysis.We introduce a novel graph
neural network that separates temporal dynamics from static handshape
configurations. Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures
with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition,
including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish
the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences,
achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods
achieving 25%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了分类任务选择对胎儿超声图像中OOD检测性能的影响，发现OOD检测效果显著依赖于具体任务，且最佳任务选择取决于ID-OOD标准类型（图像特征偏移或解剖特征偏移）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注不确定性量化方法，但忽略了分类任务本身对OOD检测的影响。在胎儿超声图像存在异质性和不同临床设置的背景下，可靠的OOD检测对深度学习模型的安全部署至关重要。

Method: 在四个分类任务上测试了八种不确定性量化方法，分析任务选择如何影响OOD检测性能，特别关注两种ID-OOD标准：图像特征偏移和解剖特征偏移。

Result: 实验表明OOD检测性能随任务不同而有显著变化，最佳任务取决于具体的ID-OOD标准。同时发现优异的OOD检测性能并不保证最优的弃权预测效果。

Conclusion: 在医学图像分析中，需要根据具体下游应用来协调任务选择和不确定性策略，不能仅依赖OOD检测性能作为唯一评估标准。

Abstract: Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment
of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image
characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a
classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples.
While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification
methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself.
Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four
classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance
significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the
defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an
image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we
reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained
prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty
strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OrthoLoC数据集和AdHoP细化技术，用于解决无人机在无网络/GPS环境下基于正射地理数据的视觉定位问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位系统在资源受限场景下（无网络连接或GPS支持）难以使用大型图像数据库或重型3D模型，而正射地理数据轻量且易获取，但相关研究较少

Method: 创建包含16,425张无人机图像的大规模数据集，提出AdHoP细化技术可集成到任何特征匹配器中，通过解耦图像检索和特征匹配来评估定位性能

Result: AdHoP技术可将匹配性能提升高达95%，平移误差降低高达63%，数据集解决了无人机图像与地理数据之间的域偏移问题

Conclusion: OrthoLoC为基于正射地理数据的视觉定位提供了首个大规模基准，AdHoP技术显著提升了定位精度，为资源受限环境下的高精度定位提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with
applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue
operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision
localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet
connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D
models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging
orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and
increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g.,
the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first
large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United
States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between
UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking
of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching,
allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance.
Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data
resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a
refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature
matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up
to 63%. The dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SSDnet的单图像异常定位方法，无需训练数据或参考样本，利用卷积神经网络的归纳偏置进行自重构异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中训练数据不可用、只有测试图像本身的零样本异常检测问题，利用自然图像具有统一纹理和模式的特点。

Method: 设计基于patch的训练框架，直接输入图像进行自重构而非随机噪声映射，采用掩码、patch打乱和高斯噪声避免恒等映射，使用基于内积相似度的感知损失。

Result: 在MVTec-AD上达到0.99 AUROC和0.60 AUPRC，在fabric数据集上达到0.98 AUROC和0.67 AUPRC，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SSDnet无需外部训练数据、标签或参考样本，对噪声或缺失像素具有鲁棒性，在零样本异常定位任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from
collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many
real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only
the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by
proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the
inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior
(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key
assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,
and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or
stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based
training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for
self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in
DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,
patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual
loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel
fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,
and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves
0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the
fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code
will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对低资源孟加拉语的视觉-语言模型，通过三重损失函数（PAL+InfoNCE+OT）改善图像与文本的对齐，在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如孟加拉语）视觉-语言模型中的对齐问题，这些问题源于配对数据稀缺、翻译对齐断裂以及英语中心预训练忽略目标语言语义。

Method: 使用LaBSE验证的英-孟配对数据和11万张双语提示合成图像训练管道。采用冻结的MaxViT提取视觉特征，孟加拉语原生mBART-50解码，轻量级桥接模块连接模态。核心创新是三重损失函数：PAL对齐真实和合成补丁描述符，InfoNCE强制全局分离，Sinkhorn OT确保细粒度补丁对应。

Result: 在Flickr30k-1k上达到BLEU-4 12.29、METEOR 27.98、BERTScore-F1 71.20；在MSCOCO-1k上达到BLEU-4 12.00、METEOR 28.14、BERTScore-F1 75.40，优于强基线方法，并将真实-合成质心差距缩小41%。

Conclusion: 提出的三重损失函数协同作用有效改善了低资源语言的视觉-语言对齐，减少了虚假匹配，为低资源语言的多模态建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains
challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This
stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and
English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address
this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified
EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT
yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a
lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss
objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch
descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global
real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained
patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces
spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR
27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14,
BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the
real--synthetic centroid gap by 41%.

Conclusion: TinyBEV证明了在资源受限环境中可以保留完整的驾驶智能，弥合了大规模多模态感知规划模型与部署就绪的实时自动驾驶之间的差距。

Abstract: We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework
that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher
(UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient
camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the
complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting,
occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined
28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD
[19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines
feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to
effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV
representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08
minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x
faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that
full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained
settings, bridging the gap between large-scale, multi-modal perception-planning
models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy.

Motivation: 现有标注方法将球标注在模糊前缘，忽略了与速度相关的运动线索，导致检测系统在快速移动物体（如乒乓球）上表现不佳。

Method: 引入新的标注策略，将球置于模糊条纹中心并标注模糊属性；提出BlurBall模型，通过多帧输入的Squeeze-and-Excitation注意力机制联合估计球位置和运动模糊属性。

Result: 新标注方法在各种模型上一致提升检测性能，BlurBall模型在球检测任务上达到state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: 利用运动模糊信息不仅提高检测精度，还能实现更可靠的轨迹预测，有益于实时体育分析应用。

Abstract: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for
detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as
streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the
ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring
valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new
labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and
explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new
table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach
consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore,
we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion
blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as
Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy
but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time
sports analytics.

TL;DR: MVP是一种无需训练的视频目标检测方法，通过关键帧检测和压缩域运动向量传播来减少计算开销，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低帧处理频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型开放词汇检测器在视频帧上逐帧运行计算成本高的问题，寻求在保持准确性的同时减少检测器调用次数的方法。

Method: 在固定间隔的关键帧上运行OWLv2检测器，使用压缩域运动向量将检测结果传播到中间帧，通过3x3网格聚合运动向量提供平移和均匀尺度更新，并加入区域增长检查和可选单类切换。

Result: 在ILSVRC2015-VID验证集上达到mAP@0.5=0.609和mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316，在宽松IoU阈值下接近逐帧OWLv2-Large性能，优于基于跟踪器的传播方法。

Conclusion: 压缩域传播是一种实用的方法，可以在减少检测器调用的同时保持视频中的强零样本覆盖能力，且无需标签训练和开放词汇特性使其具有广泛应用价值。

Abstract: Running a large open-vocabulary (Open-vocab) detector on every video frame is
accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes
OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to
intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3
grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale
updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class
switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt
list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset),
our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise
OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse
localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP
outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A
supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled
training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These
results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to
reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

*Zitian Zhang,Joshua Urban Davis,Jeanne Phuong Anh Vu,Jiangtao Kuang,Jean-François Lalonde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了高动态范围（HDR）光照估计方法在颜色鲁棒性方面的问题，提出使用预训练的白平衡网络预处理输入图像来提升现有模型的颜色准确性，无需重新训练光照估计模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然单图像HDR光照估计技术为增强现实应用带来了新可能，但现有方法往往忽略了颜色鲁棒性这一关键因素。大多数评估将颜色与其他光照属性（如强度、方向）混为一谈，而本研究将颜色作为主要关注变量。

Method: 本研究没有提出新的光照估计算法，而是探索简单的适应技术是否能提升现有模型的颜色准确性。使用包含多样化光照颜色的新型HDR数据集，系统评估了几种适应策略，包括使用预训练的白平衡网络预处理输入图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用预训练白平衡网络预处理输入图像的方法在所有测试场景中都优于其他策略，显著提升了颜色鲁棒性。该方法在三种最先进的光照估计方法上都验证了其通用性。

Conclusion: 简单的预处理技术（如白平衡）可以有效提升现有光照估计模型的颜色准确性，且无需重新训练模型，为增强现实应用中的视觉真实感提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image
have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications.
Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for
the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we
investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet
critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate
color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate
color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new
lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques
can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset
featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several
adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with
a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming
other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires
no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the
generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art
lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型和多模态大语言模型的无需训练框架，用于支票关键字段的零样本检测，解决了传统方法对大量标注数据的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支票在金融系统中使用广泛但易受欺诈，传统检测方法依赖大量标注数据，而这些数据由于隐私和专有性问题难以获取。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型(VLM)和多模态大语言模型(MLLM)构建训练免费框架，实现支票字段的零样本检测，无需预先训练。

Result: 在包含110张不同格式支票的手工标注数据集上测试，表现出强大的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能有效检测支票字段，还可作为生成高质量标注数据的引导机制，为开发专门的实时目标检测模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem,
facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However,
their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud,
underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the
core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of
critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition
(MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are
essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the
same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object
detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets,
a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this
paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field
detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction
with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot
detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment
in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a
hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts
demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore,
this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality
labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object
detection models tailored to institutional needs.

TL;DR: 本文评估了当前主流视觉语言模型在图表理解任务中的表现，发现在图表失真或遮挡情况下模型性能显著下降，并出现幻觉问题。作者提出了CHART NOISe数据集来测试模型在噪声和遮挡条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解基准假设图表清晰且查询基于事实，但现实世界图表常包含失真，需要超越简单匹配的推理能力。当前模型在退化设置下表现不佳且过度自信。

Method: 评估ChatGPT 4o、Claude Sonnet 4和Gemini 2.5 Pro在图表理解任务中的表现，引入CHART NOISe数据集（包含图表损坏、遮挡和考试风格多选题），并提出提示反向不一致性测试方法。

Result: 模型在图表损坏或遮挡情况下性能急剧下降，幻觉问题（如数值捏造、趋势误读、实体混淆）更频繁出现，模型在退化设置下仍过度自信。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图表推理中的系统性漏洞，CHART NOISe为推进图表理解的鲁棒性和可靠性建立了严格测试平台，提出了质量过滤和遮挡检测等基线缓解策略。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet
existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world
charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching.
We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp
performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as
value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more
frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating
plausible but unsupported explanations.
  To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers,
and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset
combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice
questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt
reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm
versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in
chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying
corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline
mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection.
Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness
and reliability in chart understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经表示的4D-MRI重建方法，通过两个协同网络（SAN和TMN）将呼吸运动建模为连续变形，替代传统的离散分箱方法，显著提高了处理效率和运动捕捉准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4D-MRI重建方法依赖相位分箱或独立模板扫描，难以捕捉时间变异性，工作流程复杂且计算负担重，需要更高效准确的运动建模方法。

Method: 使用神经表示框架，将呼吸运动视为由1D替代信号引导的平滑连续变形。包含空间解剖网络（SAN）编码连续3D解剖表示，和时间运动网络（TMN）生成时间一致的变形场。

Result: 在19名志愿者的自由呼吸数据集上验证，该方法能准确捕捉规则和不规则呼吸模式，保持血管和支气管连续性，处理时间从5小时减少到15分钟训练时间，每帧3D体积推断时间小于1秒。

Conclusion: 该方法无需模板和相位分箱，能准确重建任意呼吸状态的3D图像，性能优于传统方法，在4D放射治疗规划和实时自适应治疗中具有强大应用潜力。

Abstract: Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing
respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery.
Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning
or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability,
complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a
neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth,
continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing
the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion
modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the
Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical
representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by
Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent
deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers
demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both
regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and
bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method
significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from
approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to
just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D
volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at
any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional
methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation
therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

*Prithvi Raj Singh,Raju Gottumukkala,Anthony Maida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了五种基于卡尔曼滤波的跟踪方法在快速移动微小物体（如壁球）跟踪中的性能，发现DeepOCSORT在跟踪精度上表现最佳，但所有方法都存在显著的跟踪漂移问题，表明现有方法在处理快速移动微小物体的不可预测运动模式方面存在根本性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速移动微小物体的精确跟踪是计算机视觉中的挑战性问题，特别是在体育机器人应用中。虽然基于卡尔曼滤波的跟踪方法在一般物体跟踪场景中表现出色，但在处理具有不规则弹跳行为的快速移动物体时性能显著下降。

Method: 使用包含10,000个标注壁球帧的自定义数据集，评估了五种最先进的卡尔曼滤波跟踪方法（OCSORT、DeepOCSORT、ByteTrack、BoTSORT和StrongSORT），重点分析推理速度和每图像更新频率对跟踪精度和可靠性的影响。

Result: DeepOCSORT实现了最低的跟踪误差（平均ADE为31.15像素），而ByteTrack处理速度最快（平均推理时间为26.6ms）。但所有跟踪器都表现出显著的跟踪漂移，空间误差范围为3-11cm（ADE值：31-114像素）。

Conclusion: 当前跟踪方法的误差率比标准物体跟踪基准高3-4倍，表明需要专门的方法论来处理快速移动微小物体的跟踪应用。

Abstract: Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking
of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems
in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics
applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot
perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking
methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their
performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects
that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking
methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom
dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p
resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors:
inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters
affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our
experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT
achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared
to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest
processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms.
However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit
significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values:
31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the
unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs.
Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial
improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking
benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving
tiny object tracking applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频动作识别方法在压缩域中效率不高，需要开发一种能够利用压缩视频中已有运动信息的高效方法，减少计算开销同时保持或提升识别精度。

Method: MoCrop采用轻量级流程，包括去噪与合并(DM)、蒙特卡洛采样(MCS)和通过运动密度子矩阵搜索的自适应裁剪(AC)，生成单一剪辑级裁剪应用于所有I帧。

Result: 在UCF101数据集上，MoCrop在相同FLOPs下提升Top-1准确率3.5%，或在减少26.5%FLOPs的同时提升2.4%准确率。应用于CoViAR时，在原始计算成本下达到89.2%准确率，减少计算量后仍保持88.5%准确率。

Conclusion: MoCrop具有强泛化能力，适用于多种骨干网络，为压缩域实时部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce MoCrop, a motion-aware adaptive cropping module for efficient
video action recognition in the compressed domain. MoCrop uses motion vectors
that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a
single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module
is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse
backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte
Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix
search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves
accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy
at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer
FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy
at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6
to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B
indicate strong generality and make MoCrop practical for real-time deployment
in the compressed domain. Our code and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低比特率条件下性能不佳，要么保留过多冗余细节，要么学习过度集中的符号分布，需要更好的特征压缩方案

Method: 使用代码本和向量量化将连续视觉特征映射为离散索引，选择性传输到云端，保留更多信息丰富的视觉模式

Result: 实验证明该方法在码率和准确率方面具有优越性，对低比特率条件更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: CAFC-SE框架通过语义增强的代码本自适应特征压缩，有效解决了低比特率条件下的特征压缩问题

Abstract: Coding images for machines with minimal bitrate and strong analysis
performance is key to effective edge-cloud systems. Several approaches deploy
an image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods
compress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform
analysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform
poorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or
learn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a
Codebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic
Enhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete
indices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and
selectively transmits them to the cloud. The VQ operation that projects feature
vectors onto the nearest visual primitives enables us to preserve more
informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. Hence, CAFC-SE is
less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method in terms of rate and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学图像分割方法计算复杂度高、参数量大，难以在资源受限环境（如床边设备）中实时应用的问题

Method: 设计了多核深度卷积块（MKDC）处理多分辨率空间关系，结合通道、空间和分组门控注意力机制突出图像显著特征

Result: 仅需0.316M参数和0.314G FLOPs，在六个医学图像基准测试中DICE分数优于TransUNet、UNeXt等SOTA方法，参数减少333倍，性能提升高达6.7%

Conclusion: MK-UNet在保持高精度的同时大幅降低计算需求，为资源受限环境下的实时医学诊断提供了无与伦比的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MK-UNet, a paradigm shift towards
ultra-lightweight, multi-kernel U-shaped CNNs tailored for medical image
segmentation. Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution
block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels,
while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also
emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention
mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our
MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M
parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but
also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy
over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging
benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with
nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively.
Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation
performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with
4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent
lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with
much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with
drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for
real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such
as point-of-care devices. Our implementation is available at

Abstract: We introduce BridgeSplat, a novel approach for deformable surgical navigation

parametrizing each Gaussian relative to its parent mesh triangle, we enforce
alignment between Gaussians and mesh and obtain deformations that can be
propagated back to update the CT. We demonstrate BridgeSplat's effectiveness on
visceral pig surgeries and synthetic data of a human liver under simulation,

Conclusion: DGLE框架通过扩散模型的强大去噪能力和复杂分布建模能力，成功解决了源自由域自适应中伪标签质量优化的问题，为实际应用场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of
remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how
to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is
inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.
Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many
high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.
Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more
supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain
substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This
limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus
restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel
pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment
(DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and
propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality
of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on
confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which
utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a
small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage
the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular
distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed
noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby
generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively
avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,
significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the
model's performance in the target domain.

Conclusion: 双曲空间嵌入为粗到细的少样本类增量学习提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了模型在层次数据上的表示和分类性能。

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior
representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional
Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot
Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe
approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently
normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the
embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose
embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ
the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor
to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball
instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss
and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and
classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under
few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic
space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors.
This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate
overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL
benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class
accuracies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种几何感知的两阶段框架GeoRemover，用于智能图像编辑中的物体移除，能够同时移除目标物体及其因果视觉伪影（如阴影和反射）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么严格遵循掩码对齐训练而无法移除未明确掩码的因果效果，要么采用松散掩码对齐策略缺乏可控性且可能过度擦除其他物体。这些限制源于忽略了物体几何存在与其视觉效果之间的因果关系。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段从几何（如深度）中直接移除物体，使用严格掩码对齐监督；第二阶段基于更新后的几何条件渲染逼真的RGB图像。引入基于正负样本对的偏好驱动目标来指导几何移除阶段的学习。

Result: 在两个流行基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在移除物体及其相关伪影方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GeoRemover通过解耦几何移除和外观渲染，有效解决了物体移除中的因果视觉伪影问题，实现了结构感知的编辑和逼真的图像渲染。

Abstract: Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the
target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections.
However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly
mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not
explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack
controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify
that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an
object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,
we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal
into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we
remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly
mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong
geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB
image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are
considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide
learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven
objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to
remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new
structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their
associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks. The code is available at

Method: SEGA方法通过高斯平滑源模型的梯度并进行集成来近似目标模型的梯度，并使用专门的扰动滤波掩码确保对抗扰动的不可感知性

Result: 在CLIVE数据集上的实验结果表明SEGA具有优越的迁移性，能够成功实现基于迁移的黑盒攻击

Conclusion: SEGA是首个解决NR-IQA模型攻击低迁移性挑战的方法，为黑盒场景下的模型安全评估提供了有效工具

Abstract: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models play an important role
in various real-world applications. Recently, adversarial attacks against
NR-IQA models have attracted increasing attention, as they provide valuable
insights for revealing model vulnerabilities and guiding robust system design.
Some effective attacks have been proposed against NR-IQA models in white-box
settings, where the attacker has full access to the target model. However,
these attacks often suffer from poor transferability to unknown target models
in more realistic black-box scenarios, where the target model is inaccessible.
This work makes the first attempt to address the challenge of low
transferability in attacking NR-IQA models by proposing a transferable Signed
Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA). The main idea is to approximate the
gradient of the target model by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models
and ensembling their smoothed gradients. To ensure the imperceptibility of
adversarial perturbations, SEGA further removes inappropriate perturbations
using a specially designed perturbation filter mask. Experimental results on
the CLIVE dataset demonstrate the superior transferability of SEGA, validating
its effectiveness in enabling successful transfer-based black-box attacks
against NR-IQA models.

*Mohammad Junayed Hasan,Nabeel Mohammed,Shafin Rahman,Philipp Koehn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaSmileNet是一个新颖的特征融合框架，通过参数自由的Hadamard乘法交互直接集成基于transformer的表征与生理学基础的D-Markers特征，在微笑表情识别任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多任务学习框架在微笑表情识别中的计算效率低下问题，这些方法由于辅助任务监督和复杂的损失平衡需求而存在效率瓶颈。

Method: 提出HadaSmileNet框架，系统评估了15种融合策略，发现Hadamard乘法融合能够实现直接特征交互同时保持计算效率。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上取得最先进结果：UvA-NEMO（88.7%，+0.8）、MMI（99.7%）、SPOS（98.5%，+0.7）和BBC（100%，+5.0），参数减少26%且训练简化。

Conclusion: 该框架的高效性和有效性使其特别适合需要实时情感计算能力的多媒体数据挖掘应用的实际部署。

Abstract: The distinction between genuine and posed emotions represents a fundamental
pattern recognition challenge with significant implications for data mining
applications in social sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.
While recent multi-task learning frameworks have shown promise in combining
deep learning architectures with handcrafted D-Marker features for smile facial
emotion recognition, these approaches exhibit computational inefficiencies due
to auxiliary task supervision and complex loss balancing requirements. This
paper introduces HadaSmileNet, a novel feature fusion framework that directly
integrates transformer-based representations with physiologically grounded
D-Markers through parameter-free multiplicative interactions. Through
systematic evaluation of 15 fusion strategies, we demonstrate that Hadamard
multiplicative fusion achieves optimal performance by enabling direct feature
interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach
establishes new state-of-the-art results for deep learning methods across four
benchmark datasets: UvA-NEMO (88.7 percent, +0.8), MMI (99.7 percent), SPOS
(98.5 percent, +0.7), and BBC (100 percent, +5.0). Comprehensive computational
analysis reveals 26 percent parameter reduction and simplified training
compared to multi-task alternatives, while feature visualization demonstrates
enhanced discriminative power through direct domain knowledge integration. The
framework's efficiency and effectiveness make it particularly suitable for
practical deployment in multimedia data mining applications that require
real-time affective computing capabilities.

*Xiaoting Yin,Hao Shi,Kailun Yang,Jiajun Zhai,Shangwei Guo,Lin Wang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机和3D高斯泼溅的联合动态人体与静态场景重建框架，通过事件引导的损失函数解决快速运动下的模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频中重建动态人体和静态场景存在困难，特别是在快速运动时RGB帧会出现运动模糊。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率的优势，更适合动态人体重建。

Method: 使用统一的3D高斯集合，其中可学习的语义属性区分人体和场景高斯。人体高斯进行变形动画，场景高斯保持静态。提出事件引导损失函数，匹配连续渲染间的亮度变化与事件流。

Result: 在两个基准数据集ZJU-MoCap-Blur和MMHPSD-Blur上实现了最先进的人体场景重建效果，在PSNR/SSIM指标上显著优于基线方法，LPIPS降低，特别对高速运动主体效果明显。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部人体掩码，简化了高斯集合管理，通过事件引导有效解决了快速运动下的模糊问题，为动态人体与静态场景的联合重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans together with static scenes from monocular
videos remains difficult, especially under fast motion, where RGB frames suffer
from motion blur. Event cameras exhibit distinct advantages, e.g., microsecond
temporal resolution, making them a superior sensing choice for dynamic human
reconstruction. Accordingly, we present a novel event-guided human-scene
reconstruction framework that jointly models human and scene from a single
monocular event camera via 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, a unified set
of 3D Gaussians carries a learnable semantic attribute; only Gaussians
classified as human undergo deformation for animation, while scene Gaussians
stay static. To combat blur, we propose an event-guided loss that matches
simulated brightness changes between consecutive renderings with the event
stream, improving local fidelity in fast-moving regions. Our approach removes
the need for external human masks and simplifies managing separate Gaussian
sets. On two benchmark datasets, ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur, it delivers
state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction, with notable gains over strong
baselines in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Live-E2T是一个实时威胁监控框架，通过结构化语义元组、在线事件去重和基于大语言模型的推理机制，同时实现高性能威胁检测和决策可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（监督学习和生成模型）难以同时满足实时性能和决策可解释性的要求，需要一种统一框架来解决这一挑战。

Method: 1）将视频帧解构为结构化的人-物-交互-地点语义元组；2）提出高效的在线事件去重和更新机制；3）使用思维链策略微调大语言模型进行透明推理。

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime基准数据集上的实验表明，Live-E2T在威胁检测精度、实时效率和可解释性方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: Live-E2T成功统一了实时性能和可解释性目标，为实时威胁监控提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams
and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory
text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning
or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding
requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two
objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video
frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This
approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing
the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second,
an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to
filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time
responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a
Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and
logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment
reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and
UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the
crucial dimension of explainability.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在美学视觉理解方面存在局限，主要关注一般性视觉理解（如检测、定位），而缺乏对美学要素（如色彩、光影、构图）的专业分析能力，无法满足真实摄影场景中对专业知识的深度需求。

Method: 1）构建大规模专业摄影数据集PhotoCritique；2）提出PhotoEye模型，采用语言引导的多视角视觉融合机制；3）建立全面专业的美学视觉理解基准PhotoBench。

Conclusion: 通过专业数据集、创新模型和全面基准的协同设计，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在美学视觉理解方面的能力，为专业摄影分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult
to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator,
Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and
aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the
factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object
identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color
block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection,
localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual
understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they
are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they
frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive
expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing
knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To
fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce
a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among
professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large
scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from
PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a
languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image
aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark,
PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual
understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates
clear advantages over existing models.

Method: 利用XMem模型的内存增强架构，在有限标注数据条件下实现对肿瘤运动的实时跟踪和分割。

Result: 由于实验记录丢失无法报告精确定量结果，但初步开发印象显示该框架具有合理的分割性能并满足临床实时要求。

Conclusion: 该XMem-based框架为MRI引导放疗中的肿瘤跟踪精度提升做出了贡献。

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced tumor segmentation framework for real-time
MRI-guided radiotherapy, designed for the TrackRAD2025 challenge. Our method
leverages the XMem model, a memory-augmented architecture, to segment tumors
across long cine-MRI sequences. The proposed system efficiently integrates
memory mechanisms to track tumor motion in real-time, achieving high
segmentation accuracy even under challenging conditions with limited annotated
data. Unfortunately, the detailed experimental records have been lost,
preventing us from reporting precise quantitative results at this stage.
Nevertheless, From our preliminary impressions during development, the
XMem-based framework demonstrated reasonable segmentation performance and
satisfied the clinical real-time requirement. Our work contributes to improving
the precision of tumor tracking during MRI-guided radiotherapy, which is
crucial for enhancing the accuracy and safety of cancer treatments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSCM模型解决多对比度MRI超分辨率问题，通过动态空间扭曲、语义感知令牌聚合和空间频率融合模块，在保持空间语义一致性的同时提升重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在建模空间语义一致性和利用频域信息方面不足，导致细粒度对齐差和高频细节恢复不充分

Method: SSCM模型包含三个核心模块：动态空间扭曲模块实现跨对比度空间对齐，语义感知令牌聚合块保持长程语义一致性，空间频率融合块恢复精细结构

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，SSCM以更少的参数实现了最先进的性能，确保空间和语义一致的重建

Conclusion: SSCM模型有效解决了多对比度MRI超分辨率中的空间语义一致性问题，在保持解剖结构对齐的同时提升了图像质量

Abstract: Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) aims
to enhance low-resolution (LR) contrasts leveraging high-resolution (HR)
references, shortening acquisition time and improving imaging efficiency while
preserving anatomical details. The main challenge lies in maintaining
spatial-semantic consistency, ensuring anatomical structures remain
well-aligned and coherent despite structural discrepancies and motion between
the target and reference images. Conventional methods insufficiently model
spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, which
leads to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency
details. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model
(SSCM), which integrates a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast
spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range
semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure
restoration. Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and
semantically consistent reconstructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有放射学报告生成方法对大规模数据和计算资源的依赖问题，开发在预算受限条件下仍能高效工作的紧凑框架

Method: OraPO通过轻量级oracle步骤将失败的GRPO探索转化为直接偏好监督，实现单阶段RL训练；FactS通过提取原子临床事实并与真实标签进行蕴含检查，提供密集可解释的句子级奖励

Result: 在CheXpert Plus数据集上达到0.341 F1分数的新SOTA性能，训练数据减少2-3个数量级，使用小型基础VLM在普通硬件上实现

Conclusion: OraPO和FactS共同构成了紧凑而强大的框架，显著提高了临床挑战性病例的学习效率，为资源受限环境下的放射学报告生成提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce clinically
faithful reports from chest X-ray images. Prevailing work typically follows a
scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and
oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In
this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based
reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables
single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare
or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight
oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic
clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding
dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a
compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency
on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the
CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training
data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

TL;DR: AMSF是一个无需训练的参考式框架，能够在扩散模型中实现多参考风格的可控融合，解决了现有方法只能处理单一风格图像和缺乏平衡多种风格影响机制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参考式方法存在两个主要限制：(a) 只能接受单一风格图像，无法实现混合美学和扩展到更多风格；(b) 缺乏平衡多种风格影响的原则性机制。AMSF旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 通过语义标记分解模块编码所有风格图像和文本提示，自适应注入到冻结扩散模型的每个交叉注意力层中。相似性感知重加权模块在每个去噪步骤重新校准分配给每个风格组件的注意力权重。

Result: 定性和定量评估显示，AMSF产生的多风格融合结果始终优于最先进方法，且其融合设计可无缝扩展到两种或更多风格。

Conclusion: AMSF代表了扩散模型中表达性多风格生成的实用步骤，实现了无需微调或外部适配器的平衡且用户可控的风格融合。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based
training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference
styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are
limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid
aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled
mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these
challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token
decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention
layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then
recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style
component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any
fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations
show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to
two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward
expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MLF-4DRCNet，一种用于4D雷达和相机图像多级融合的两阶段3D目标检测框架，解决了现有方法忽略雷达点云稀疏性和不完整几何特性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D毫米波雷达成本低且鲁棒性强，但其点云稀疏且噪声大，限制了在3D目标检测中的独立应用。现有雷达-相机融合方法大多采用为LiDAR设计的BEV融合范式，忽视了雷达的固有缺陷。

Method: 提出三模块框架：增强雷达点编码器（ERPE）通过三重注意力体素特征编码器稠密化点云；分层场景融合池化（HSFP）使用可变形注意力动态融合多尺度体素特征与2D图像特征；提案级融合增强（PLFE）通过融合图像特征精炼区域提案。

Result: 在View-of-Delft和TJ4DRadSet数据集上的实验表明，MLF-4DRCNet达到了最先进的性能，在VoD数据集上的性能可与基于LiDAR的模型相媲美。

Conclusion: MLF-4DRCNet通过点级、场景级和提案级的多模态信息融合，实现了全面的特征表示，有效解决了4D雷达点云稀疏性问题，为自动驾驶感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar, measuring the range, azimuth,
elevation, and Doppler velocity of objects, is recognized for its
cost-effectiveness and robustness in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, its
point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone
application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have
provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt
explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera
fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the
sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to
coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose
MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via
multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the
point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling
comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components:
the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion
Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module.
Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image
instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel
Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D
image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts
pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image
features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP.
Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets
demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD
dataset.

TL;DR: PDLS是一种无需训练的双流潜在空间引导框架，通过结构路径和语义路径的互补来解决扩散模型图像重建中的语义漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像编码为单个潜在向量时，难以平衡结构保真度和语义准确性，导致重建图像出现语义漂移（如细节模糊或属性错误）。

Method: 基于Rectified Flow模型的稳定反演路径，将反演过程分解为结构路径（保持源完整性）和语义路径（由提示词引导），通过最优控制问题和线性二次调节器实现动态轨迹引导。

Result: 在FFHQ-1K和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，PDLS在各种反演任务（高斯去模糊、运动去模糊、超分辨率和自由形式修复）中比单潜在基线产生更忠实于原始图像且语义对齐更好的重建结果。

Conclusion: PDLS框架无需昂贵的每图像优化，能有效防止语义漂移同时保留精细细节，为扩散模型图像反演提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is
challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent
vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading
to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect
attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering
(PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for
their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two
complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a
semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal
control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory
at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine
detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K
and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring,
motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that
PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image
and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

Motivation: 全球MRI需求持续增长给医疗系统带来压力，延长了诊断周转时间，加剧了医生职业倦怠，这些问题在资源匮乏和农村地区尤为严重。

Method: 利用大型学术医疗系统作为数据引擎，训练了包含22万例MRI研究的视觉语言模型Prima，采用分层视觉架构提供通用且可迁移的MRI特征。

Result: 在包含3万例MRI研究的1年系统测试中，Prima在主要神经系统疾病（肿瘤、炎症、感染、发育病变等）的诊断中平均AUC达到92.0%，优于现有最先进的通用和医疗AI模型。

Conclusion: Prima展示了健康系统规模视觉语言模型的变革潜力，能够提供可解释的鉴别诊断、放射科医生工作清单优先级和临床转诊建议，有助于减轻医疗系统偏见。

Abstract: Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological
diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has
risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging
turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout \cite{Chen2017-bt,
Rula2024-qp-1}. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in
low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health
system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM)
serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical
MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a
hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI
features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included
30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic
disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental
lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0,
outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima
offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists,
and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and
MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups
and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times
for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven
healthcare.

Abstract: Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for
text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these
reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which
limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the
deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel
reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG),
which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to
reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is
to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities
during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative
abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse
understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated
image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing
instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step,
gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG
framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image
generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on
the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark. The project code:

Abstract: Monocular relative and metric depth estimation has seen a tremendous boost in
the last few years due to the sharp advancements in foundation models and in
particular transformer based networks. As we start to see applications to the
domain of endoscopic images, there is still a lack of robust benchmarks and
high-quality datasets in that area. This paper addresses these limitations by
presenting a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art (metric and relative)
depth estimation models evaluated on real, unseen endoscopic images, providing
critical insights into their generalisation and performance in clinical
scenarios. Additionally, we introduce and publish a novel synthetic dataset
(EndoSynth) of endoscopic surgical instruments paired with ground truth metric
depth and segmentation masks, designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and
real-world data. We demonstrate that fine-tuning depth foundation models using
our synthetic dataset boosts accuracy on most unseen real data by a significant
margin. By providing both a benchmark and a synthetic dataset, this work
advances the field of depth estimation for endoscopic images and serves as an
important resource for future research. Project page, EndoSynth dataset and
trained weights are available at https://github.com/TouchSurgery/EndoSynth.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LEAF-Mamba模型，通过局部强调状态空间模块和自适应融合模块，解决RGB-D显著目标检测中局部语义不足和跨模态融合不充分的问题，在性能和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D显著目标检测方法存在局限性：CNN受限于局部感受野，Vision Transformers存在二次复杂度问题。状态空间模型(SSM)虽然能有效建模长距离依赖，但直接应用于RGB-D SOD会导致局部语义不足和跨模态融合不充分。

Method: 提出LEAF-Mamba模型，包含两个核心组件：1)局部强调状态空间模块(LE-SSM)，捕获多尺度局部依赖；2)基于SSM的自适应融合模块(AFM)，实现互补的跨模态交互和可靠的跨模态集成。

Result: 在16个最先进的RGB-D SOD方法中，LEAF-Mamba在效能和效率上均表现最优。同时在RGB-T SOD任务上也表现出色，证明其强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LEAF-Mamba模型成功解决了RGB-D SOD中的关键挑战，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的性能，展现了状态空间模型在跨模态视觉任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous
objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods
mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision
Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a
challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently,
state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling
long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to
RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate
cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and
Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel
components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture
multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive
fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable
cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in
both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent
performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合窗口多头注意力机制和空间注意力机制的轻量级食品图像分类算法，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品行业对生产质量和效率要求不断提高，但现有Vision Transformer模型参数量大、计算复杂度高，难以在资源受限环境中部署

Method: 集成窗口多头注意力机制(WMHAM)和空间注意力机制(SAM)，WMHAM通过窗口分区捕获局部和全局上下文特征降低计算成本，SAM自适应强调关键空间区域提升特征表示能力

Result: 在Food-101和Vireo Food-172数据集上分别达到95.24%和94.33%的准确率，同时显著减少参数和FLOPs

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和分类性能之间实现了有效平衡，适合在资源受限环境中部署

Abstract: With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and
technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality
and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling
automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety
supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this
task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high
computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues,
we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a
Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism
(SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global
contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM
adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature
representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%,
respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with
baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an
effective balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像中开放集土地覆盖分析的需求，需要同时实现细粒度空间定位和语义开放分类，既要检测和分割无类别监督的新物体，又要通过多模态推理赋予可解释的语义标签

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 使用可提示的微调分割模型(SAM)进行精确发现和掩码提取；2) 通过两阶段微调的多模态大语言模型(MLLM)进行语义归因和上下文描述；3) 使用LLM作为评判者和人工评分来评估MLLM

Conclusion: OSDA为动态土地覆盖监测提供了可扩展和可解释的解决方案，在自动化制图更新和大规模地球观测分析方面显示出强大潜力

Abstract: Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to
achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization.
This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without
categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels
through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated
three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery,
segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery
and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2)
semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned
multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring
of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level
semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote
sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free,
the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery
without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and
interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong
potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动植物识别主要依赖北美和西欧的野外照片数据，而生物多样性最丰富的热带地区数据稀缺。植物标本馆收藏了大量热带地区植物标本，可为数据贫乏地区提供补充数据源。

Method: 采用跨域分类任务，训练集包含数十万份植物标本馆标本和数千张野外照片，学习两个域之间的对应关系。数据还包括5个形态和功能性状值。测试集仅包含野外照片。

Result: 挑战基于约1000种主要来自圭亚那地盾地区的物种数据集进行评估，该地区是全球植物多样性最高的地区之一。

Conclusion: 通过利用植物标本馆收藏，可以显著改进生物多样性丰富但数据贫乏热带地区的自动植物识别能力。

Abstract: Automated plant identification has improved considerably thanks to recent
advances in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and
more field photos. However, this profusion of data concerns only a few tens of
thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe, much
less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical
countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have
systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria,
especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity
informatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised
records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF
2021") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of
flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It
is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana
Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant
diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain
classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred
thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a
correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata
(location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values
of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species. The test set
consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This article presents the
resources and evaluations of the assessment carried out, summarises the
approaches and systems used by the participating research groups and provides
an analysis of the main results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨类别对象融合时存在偏差、视觉混乱和语义不一致的问题，且缺乏全面的基准数据集。

Method: AGSwap包含两个关键组件：分组嵌入交换和自适应分组更新，通过特征操作和动态优化机制实现语义属性融合。

Result: 实验表明AGSwap在简单和复杂提示下均优于现有最先进的组合T2I方法，包括GPT-Image-1。

Conclusion: AGSwap是一种简单而高效的跨类别对象融合方法，COF数据集为相关研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained
increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad
applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However,
existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically
inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration.
Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a
comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose
\textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective
approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping,
which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature
manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism
guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis.
Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a
large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and
WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling
451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap
outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1
using simple and complex prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有遥感视觉定位方法受限于闭集词汇表、依赖高质量数据集和耗时微调的问题，探索冻结通用基础模型在零样本开放词汇遥感视觉定位中的潜力

Method: 三阶段框架：1）Overview阶段使用视觉语言模型获取文本查询与视觉区域的语义关联；2）Focus阶段利用扩散模型的细粒度建模能力补充结构形状信息；3）Evolve阶段通过注意力进化模块抑制无关激活，生成纯净分割掩码

Result: 大量实验表明该框架在弱监督和零样本方法中表现一致优于现有方法

Conclusion: RSVG-ZeroOV提供了一个无需繁琐任务特定训练的高效可扩展解决方案，为开放世界遥感应用提供了新思路

Abstract: Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote
sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing
approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their
applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage
generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on
expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework
that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for
zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key
stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain
cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use
self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as
cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that
capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii)
Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model
(DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are
often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention
evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding
purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome
task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently
outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

*Yingquan Wang,Pingping Zhang,Chong Sun,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种属性提示组合（APC）框架，通过文本语义联合增强目标重识别（ReID）的判别性和泛化性，解决了单域模型过拟合和跨域模型抑制身份判别特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ReID模型局限于单域或跨域场景，单域模型容易过拟合到域特定特征，而跨域模型可能抑制身份特定的判别性线索。需要一种方法同时提升判别性和泛化性。

Method: 设计了属性提示生成器（APG），包含语义属性字典（SAD）和提示组合模块（PCM）。SAD提供丰富语义描述，PCM自适应组合相关属性生成判别性特征。采用快慢训练策略（FSTS）平衡ReID特定判别性和通用表示学习。

Result: 在传统和领域广义（DG）ReID数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架在判别性和泛化性方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: APC框架通过文本语义和快慢训练策略有效解决了ReID中的判别性与泛化性平衡问题，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across
non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable
progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or
cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain
models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models
often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress
identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose
an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual
semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically,
we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic
Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an
over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while
PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative
attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization
ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training
Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable
representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS)
to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update
Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the
pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively
focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive
experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets
demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting
superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization. The
source code is available at https://github.com/AWangYQ/APC.

Method: 提出基于最优传输的细粒度视觉-文本特征距离度量，重新分配标题对，并采用最优传输目标函数促进模态间和模态内的细粒度对齐

Result: OTCCLIP成功降低了投毒攻击的成功率，相比先前方法显著提升了CLIP在投毒数据集上的零样本和线性探测性能

Conclusion: 基于最优传输的细粒度特征对齐方法能有效防御CLIP模型的投毒攻击，同时保持模型的性能

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to
massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous
defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption
for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global
representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of
visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and
harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal
Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We
propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained
visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the
proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the
negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality
fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective
functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease
the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous
methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing
performance trained on poisoned datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在从视觉语言模型迁移知识时存在根本限制，主要采用结果导向范式而忽略了底层的交互过程，这种表征差异阻碍了有效的知识迁移和跨视觉任务的泛化能力。

Method: 提出学习交互框架，核心技术创新包括交互查询（维护跨网络层的持久关系结构）和基于交互的监督（源自视觉语言模型的跨模态注意力机制）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得一致改进：TinyImageNet分类提升3.3mAP，COCO检测/分割分别提升1.6mAP和2.4AP，在跨域设置中表现优异（PACS和VLCS零样本分别提升2.4和9.3），人类评估显示语义一致性指标比结果导向方法高2.7倍。

Conclusion: LFI框架通过建模交互过程实现了更忠实和高效的知识迁移，具有最小的参数开销和更快的收敛速度，在认知对齐方面表现优异。

Abstract: Current visual foundation models (VFMs) face a fundamental limitation in
transferring knowledge from vision language models (VLMs), while VLMs excel at
modeling cross-modal interactions through unified representation spaces,
existing VFMs predominantly adopt result-oriented paradigms that neglect the
underlying interaction processes. This representational discrepancy hinders
effective knowledge transfer and limits generalization across diverse vision
tasks. We propose Learning from Interactions (LFI), a cognitive-inspired
framework that addresses this gap by explicitly modeling visual understanding
as an interactive process. Our key insight is that capturing the dynamic
interaction patterns encoded in pre-trained VLMs enables more faithful and
efficient knowledge transfer to VFMs. The approach centers on two technical
innovations, Interaction Queries, which maintain persistent relational
structures across network layers, and interaction-based supervision, derived
from the cross-modal attention mechanisms of VLMs. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving 3.3
and 1.6mAP/2.4AP absolute gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO
detection/segmentation respectively, with minimal parameter overhead and faster
convergence. The framework particularly excels in cross-domain settings,
delivering 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Human
evaluations further confirm its cognitive alignment, outperforming
result-oriented methods by 2.7 times in semantic consistency metrics.

Conclusion: HyPSAM展示了提示工程在RGB-T SOD领域的潜力，为多模态显著目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent
objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal
modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects
remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the
extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the
zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for
RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that
generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs
dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive
cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter
kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose
a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general
optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid
prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and
box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating
with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains,
thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The

Motivation: LiDAR点云在自动驾驶和机器人感知中至关重要，但原始点云容易受到噪声、遮挡和对抗性干扰的影响。传统自编码器在真实世界挑战性条件下性能下降。

Method: 提出TriFusion-AE模型，通过交叉注意力机制对齐文本语义线索、图像几何特征和LiDAR空间结构，实现多模态融合。该框架与CNN点云自编码器兼容。

Result: 在nuScenes-mini数据集上评估，模型在强对抗攻击和重噪声条件下表现出显著鲁棒性，而传统CNN自编码器在这些条件下崩溃。在轻度扰动下提升有限。

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法能够显著提高点云重建的鲁棒性，特别是在极端噪声和对抗攻击条件下。该框架具有模型无关性，可灵活集成到现有CNN点云自编码器中。

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception is central to autonomous driving and robotics, yet raw
point clouds remain highly vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial
corruptions. Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and
reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world
conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention
autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from
multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning
semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial
structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to
stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing
limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more
robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where
CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to
reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion
framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with
any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.

Motivation: 现有方法假设工具库固定，难以适应现实世界中工具数据持续演化和流式输入的环境。需要解决视频LLMs在动态工具环境中的泛化问题。

Conclusion: COLT成功增强了开源视频LLMs的持续工具使用能力，能够有效处理动态工具环境，避免灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the
research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert
models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage
capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the
instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however,
assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to
real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming
in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL
Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a
successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past
learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as
a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected
based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the
codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a
video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive
experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific
VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
proposed COLT.

Result: 大量实验表明FixingGS在视觉质量和重建性能上超越现有最先进方法

Conclusion: FixingGS能有效去除伪影并补全缺失内容，显著提升稀疏视角3D高斯溅射重建质量

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes
from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual
information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D
representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to
generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in
under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle
to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and
implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method
that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for
sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our
distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent
diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting.
In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further
refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with
superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be
released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-VLM提出了一种基于高斯分位数的非均匀权重分离方法，通过将模型权重分为异常值（显著）和多个正常值（不显著）子集，实现超低比特（≤2位）的视觉语言模型量化，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的计算需求和内存要求较高，限制了其在硬件受限环境中的应用。需要解决计算需求与超低比特权重精度之间的关键差距。

Method: 提出Bi-VLM，基于高斯分位数非均匀分离模型权重，分为异常值和多个正常值子集。开发了显著性感知混合量化算法，根据显著性度量和压缩目标对缩放器和二进制矩阵施加不同约束。

Result: 在VLM的语言模型部分，Bi-VLM在视觉问答任务上比SOTA方法提升3%-47%；在整体VLM上提升4%-45%。量化模型中图像令牌存在90%-99%的冗余，可进一步剪枝提升效率。

Conclusion: Bi-VLM成功实现了超低比特的视觉语言模型量化，显著提升了模型效率，同时发现了量化模型中存在的令牌冗余，为进一步优化提供了方向。

Abstract: We address the critical gap between the computational demands of
vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision
(bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated
by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which
restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose
Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian
quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and
multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a
proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We
propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize
weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices
based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our
approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM
outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms
of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM,
our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the
quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99%
in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to
improve efficiency.

TL;DR: DiSSECT是一个自监督学习框架，通过引入多尺度向量量化来创建离散表示瓶颈，抑制捷径学习，提高医学图像表示的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法依赖复杂架构、解剖学先验或精心调优的数据增强，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力，且容易在解剖相似度高、病理特征细微的医学图像（如胸片）中出现捷径学习问题。

Method: 将多尺度向量量化整合到自监督学习流程中，施加离散表示瓶颈，约束模型学习可重复、结构感知的特征，同时抑制视图特定或低效用模式。

Result: DiSSECT在分类和分割任务上表现优异，需要极少或无需微调，在低标签情况下显示出高标签效率，在多个公共医学影像数据集上验证了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DiSSECT框架通过离散表示瓶颈有效解决了医学图像自监督学习中的捷径学习问题，提高了表示的可迁移性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for medical
image representation learning, particularly in settings with limited labeled
data. However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures,
anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their
scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to
shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical
similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT
-- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable
Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization
into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This
constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while
suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation
transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both
classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and
shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate
DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its
robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国每年发生约210万起鹿车碰撞事故，导致440人死亡、59,000人受伤和100亿美元经济损失，同时加剧鹿群数量下降。现有可见光摄像头在恶劣天气条件下检测效果不足60%，需要更可靠的解决方案。

Result: 系统达到98.84%的平均精度、95.44%的精确度和95.96%的召回率。热成像在恶劣天气条件下保持88-92%的检测准确率，而可见光摄像头低于60%。端到端延迟始终低于100毫秒。

Conclusion: 该研究通过热成像和车联网技术建立了减少鹿车碰撞的可行技术路径，系统在各种天气条件下都能稳健运行，为驾驶员提供有效预警。

Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United
States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in
approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic
damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer
populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning
system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and
vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions.
Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal
deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation
demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision,
95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested
during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the
driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across
diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92
percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible
light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high
probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to
surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything
(CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency
consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This
research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle
collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

Motivation: 手术数据标注稀缺限制了深度学习系统在计算机辅助干预中的发展，现有扩散模型存在数据记忆化问题，导致样本不一致且多样性不足，可能损害下游任务性能。

Method: 提出SAADi框架，构建偏好和非偏好合成图像对，通过轻量级微调扩散模型，使图像生成过程与下游目标明确对齐。

Result: 在三个手术数据集上，分类任务提升7-9%，分割任务提升2-10%，对代表性不足的类别改进尤为显著。迭代细化合成样本可进一步提升性能4-10%。

Conclusion: SAADi方法克服了样本退化问题，确立了任务感知对齐作为缓解数据稀缺和推进手术视觉应用的关键原则。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for
developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While
diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data
memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to
improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical
Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion
models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs
of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs
lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation
process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical
datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and
$2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed
for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further
boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method
overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key
principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision
applications.

Abstract: Achieving high image quality for temporal frames in dynamic positron emission
tomography (PET) is challenging due to the limited statistic especially for the
short frames. Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) is useful in a
wide range of medical image denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a
model-based neural network for dynamic PET image denoising. The inter-frame
spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are
used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model.
We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural
networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end
neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data
demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for
dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may
be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic
PET. Our source code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的光流标签插值与多任务学习结合的方法有效解决了手术场景中的时空标注不平衡问题，为机器人辅助手术提供了更好的视觉理解支持。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern
surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through
minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a
precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures
is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task
approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and
diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding.
Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires
sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to
the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term
annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas
short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action
detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant
temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation
with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is
used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse
spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for
training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of
surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.

Conclusion: 通过结合先进的对抗蒸馏和人类反馈学习，该框架实现了极致的成本效益和响应性，使复杂的多模态交互变得无缝和即时

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for
their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse
content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved
multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and
autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address
this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to
simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our
approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for
next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion
denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over
a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting
lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a
22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of
the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that
enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining
advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model
achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex
multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the task of single-label
classification of Christian Iconography. The goal was to assess whether
general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5,
can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers,
and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis:
(RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian
saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with
contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study
using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and
Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were
tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2)
classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five
exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the
same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed
the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset,
where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity
to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions
generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced
lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We
conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in
visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the
application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows,
suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the
study to other classification strategies and models.

Conclusion: LRGC提供了一种有效的可学习图构建方法，消除了传统聚类或阈值方法引入的偏差，允许每层根据训练数据自适应调整阈值，显著提升了视觉图神经网络的性能。

Abstract: Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision.
Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural
Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers.
Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of
images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image
representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer
that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a
hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on
non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the
latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best
neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph
Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack
the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction
method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized
Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies
key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold
reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable
mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the
neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding
methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows
tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds
are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the
model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具增强的大型语言模型通常使用监督模仿或粗粒度强化学习训练，自我反思实践依赖启发式提示或单向推理，在多轮交互中脆弱，模型经常重复相同错误。

Method: 提出结构化反思方法，结合DAPO和GSPO目标与针对工具使用的奖励方案，优化Reflect-Call-Final策略，并引入Tool-Reflection-Bench基准进行程序化评估。

Result: 在BFCL v3和Tool-Reflection-Bench上的实验显示，多轮工具调用成功率和错误恢复能力显著提升，冗余调用减少。

Conclusion: 使反思明确化并直接优化可提高工具交互的可靠性，为智能体从失败中学习提供可复现路径。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with
supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes
single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts
or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning
error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a
failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured
reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,
controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise
reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and
then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine
DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing
the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce
Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks
structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result
consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,
reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.
Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn
tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These
results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly
improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for
agents to learn from failure.

Conclusion: 建立了灵活、可解释、即插即用的提示优化框架，为基于提示的分割提供了新思路

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), yet existing approaches often rely on heuristic or
manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization. In this
paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning
framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize
point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by
representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode
both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker
agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's
segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these
disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep
Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During
inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt
sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks
without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender
effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a
flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSplat：首个无需SfM的基于事件相机的去模糊3D高斯泼溅方法，通过预训练立体模块直接获取初始点云，并利用事件流提供细粒度监督信号


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决运动模糊问题，避免传统SfM方法中相机位姿累积误差传递到点云位置的问题

Method: 1. 利用预训练的DUSt3R密集立体模块直接从模糊图像获取准确初始点云；2. 引入事件流到去模糊流程，通过解码事件流和模糊图像的潜在清晰图像提供细粒度监督

Result: 在多种场景下的广泛实验表明，DeblurSplat不仅能生成高保真新视角，而且在渲染效率上显著优于当前最先进的去模糊3D-GS方法

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-free
deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting method via event camera, dubbed DeblurSplat.
We address the motion-deblurring problem in two ways. First, we leverage the
pretrained capability of the dense stereo module (DUSt3R) to directly obtain
accurate initial point clouds from blurred images. Without calculating camera
poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from
inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we
introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to
dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and
blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene
reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes
demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel
views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs
in deblur 3D-GS.

TL;DR: MoiréNet是一个基于U-Net的卷积神经网络框架，通过协同整合频域和空间域特征来有效去除图像中的莫尔条纹伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 莫尔条纹是由显示像素网格和相机传感器网格之间的频谱混叠引起的，表现为各向异性、多尺度的伪影，对数字图像去莫尔条纹提出了重大挑战。

Method: MoiréNet引入了两个关键组件：方向频率空间编码器（DFSE）通过方向差分卷积识别莫尔条纹方向，以及频率空间自适应选择器（FSAS）实现精确的特征自适应抑制。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoiréNet在公共和实际使用的数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时具有很高的参数效率。仅需5.513M参数，比ESDNet-L减少48%。

Conclusion: MoiréNet将卓越的恢复质量与参数效率相结合，非常适合资源受限的应用，包括智能手机摄影、工业成像和增强现实。

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns arise from spectral aliasing between display pixel lattices
and camera sensor grids, manifesting as anisotropic, multi-scale artifacts that
pose significant challenges for digital image demoir\'eing. We propose
Moir\'eNet, a convolutional neural U-Net-based framework that synergistically
integrates frequency and spatial domain features for effective artifact
removal. Moir\'eNet introduces two key components: a Directional
Frequency-Spatial Encoder (DFSE) that discerns moir\'e orientation via
directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector
(FSAS) that enables precise, feature-adaptive suppression. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Moir\'eNet achieves state-of-the-art performance
on public and actively used datasets while being highly parameter-efficient.
With only 5.513M parameters, representing a 48% reduction compared to ESDNet-L,
Moir\'eNet combines superior restoration quality with parameter efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained applications including
smartphone photography, industrial imaging, and augmented reality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的频率感知音频-视觉分割（FAVS）框架，通过频域分解和重组来解决音频-视觉分割任务中的模态间频率域矛盾问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视觉分割方法忽视了音频和视觉模态在频域上的固有矛盾——音频高频信号普遍存在干扰噪声，而视觉高频信号包含丰富的结构细节。忽略这些差异会导致性能不佳。

Method: FAVS框架包含两个关键模块：频域增强分解器（FDED）模块采用基于残差的迭代频率分解来区分模态特定语义和结构特征；协同跨模态一致性（SCMC）模块利用专家混合架构通过动态专家路由增强语义一致性和模态特定特征保留。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FAVS框架实现了最先进的性能，丰富的定性可视化进一步验证了FDED和SCMC模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 将AVS任务重新表述为频域分解和重组问题，提出的FAVS框架能够有效处理音频-视觉模态间的频率域矛盾，显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) plays a critical role in multimodal machine
learning by effectively integrating audio and visual cues to precisely segment
objects or regions within visual scenes. Recent AVS methods have demonstrated
significant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain
contradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering
noise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in
visual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper
perspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and
recomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware
Audio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules:
Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal
Consistency (SCMC) module. FDED module employs a residual-based iterative
frequency decomposition to discriminate modality-specific semantics and
structural features, and SCMC module leverages a mixture-of-experts
architecture to reinforce semantic consistency and modality-specific feature
preservation through dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our FAVS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
benchmark datasets, and abundant qualitative visualizations further verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FDED and SCMC modules. The code will be released
as open source upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Deep learning has become the de facto standard and dominant paradigm in image
analysis tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, this approach
often results in "black-box" models, whose decision-making processes are
difficult to interpret, raising concerns about reliability in critical
applications. To address this challenge and provide human a method to
understand how AI model process and make decision, the field of xAI has
emerged. This paper surveys four representative approaches in xAI for visual
perception tasks: (i) Saliency Maps, (ii) Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM),
(iii) Prototype-based methods, and (iv) Hybrid approaches. We analyze their
underlying mechanisms, strengths and limitations, as well as evaluation
metrics, thereby providing a comprehensive overview to guide future research
and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）的方法，通过改进噪声调度和时间步嵌入技术来生成高质量合成LiDAR数据，用于增强自动驾驶车辆的3D视觉系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖LiDAR提供高分辨率深度数据，但真实LiDAR数据采集耗时且易受噪声和稀疏性影响。需要生成合成数据来改善感知性能。

Method: 使用改进的DDPM模型，包含新颖的噪声调度和时间步嵌入技术，能够生成更真实的点云数据。在IAMCV和KITTI-360数据集上进行评估。

Result: 该方法在四种性能指标上优于现有最先进方法，能有效缓解噪声和稀疏LiDAR数据的影响，生成具有丰富空间关系和结构细节的多样化点云。

Conclusion: 提出的改进DDPM方法在LiDAR数据生成方面表现出色，为自动驾驶感知系统提供了有效的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by
improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that
effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs
use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides
high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation,
and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is
time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather
or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding
techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby
improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in
AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's
temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on
the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various
configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance
metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results
demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and
its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data,
producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural
detail.

TL;DR: AGSSP是一种新的预训练范式，通过异常先验指导表示学习，解决金属表面缺陷检测中自然图像预训练与工业数据预训练之间的领域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练-微调范式在金属表面缺陷检测中存在两难困境：ImageNet等自然图像预训练存在领域差距，而工业数据自监督预训练又难以区分细微缺陷与复杂背景噪声。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先通过从异常图中蒸馏知识预训练骨干网络，使其学习缺陷显著特征；然后使用从异常图生成的伪缺陷框预训练检测器，使其与定位任务对齐。

Result: 实验表明AGSSP在各种设置下都能持续提升性能，相比基于ImageNet的模型，mAP@0.5提升高达10%，mAP@0.5:0.95提升11.4%。

Conclusion: AGSSP通过异常先验指导的表示学习有效解决了工业缺陷检测中的预训练困境，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface
defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However,
its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image
datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive
self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective
due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle
defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we
introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm
that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP
employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by
distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture
defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect
boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable
this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly
maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images.
Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface
defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP
consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a
10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to
ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly
available at https://clovermini.github.io/AGSSP-Dev/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个音频驱动的通用逼真头像合成方法，结合了人物无关的语音模型和新的通用头部头像先验（UHAP），能够同时处理几何变形和外观变化，实现高质量的唇部同步和表情细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要将音频特征映射到几何变形，忽略了音频相关的外观变化。需要一种能够同时处理几何和外观变化的通用音频驱动头像模型。

Method: 使用跨身份多视角视频训练UHAP，通过中性扫描数据进行监督以捕捉身份特定细节。通用语音模型直接将原始音频输入映射到UHAP潜在表达空间，该空间编码了几何和外观变化。采用单目编码器进行个性化，通过UHAP解码生成逼真头像。

Result: 该方法能够生成具有精确唇部同步和细腻表情细节（如眉毛运动、视线转移、逼真口腔外观和运动）的高度逼真头像。在唇部同步准确性、图像质量和感知真实感方面优于现有几何方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个能够进行详细外观建模和渲染的通用音频驱动头像模型，在多个评估指标上均优于现有方法，实现了高质量的逼真头像合成。

Abstract: We introduce the first method for audio-driven universal photorealistic
avatar synthesis, combining a person-agnostic speech model with our novel
Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP). UHAP is trained on cross-identity
multi-view videos. In particular, our UHAP is supervised with neutral scan
data, enabling it to capture the identity-specific details at high fidelity. In
contrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to
geometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance
variations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the
UHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both,
geometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new
subjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression
of dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these
expression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage
to focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry.
Decoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly
realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive
details, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior
appearance as well as motion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
is not only the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that can account
for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, but it also outperforms
competing (geometry-only) methods across metrics measuring lip-sync accuracy,
quantitative image quality, and perceptual realism.

Abstract: Dendritic spines are key structural components of excitatory synapses in the
brain. Given the size of dendritic spines provides a proxy for synaptic
efficacy, their detection and tracking across time is important for studies of
the neural basis of learning and memory. Despite their relevance, large-scale
analyses of the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy
data remain challenging and labor-intense. Here, we present a modular machine
learning-based pipeline designed to automate the detection, time-tracking, and
feature extraction of dendritic spines in volumes chronically recorded with
two-photon microscopy. Our approach tackles the challenges posed by biological
data by combining a transformer-based detection module, a depth-tracking
component that integrates spatial features, a time-tracking module to associate
3D spines across time by leveraging spatial consistency, and a feature
extraction unit that quantifies biologically relevant spine properties. We
validate our method on open-source labeled spine data, and on two complementary
annotated datasets that we publish alongside this work: one for detection and
depth-tracking, and one for time-tracking, which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first data of this kind. To encourage future research, we release our
data, code, and pre-trained weights at
https://github.com/pamelaosuna/SynapFlow, establishing a baseline for scalable,
end-to-end analysis of dendritic spine dynamics.

Result: 在十个不同数据集上的实验评估表明，该方法优于基线零样本方法

Conclusion: 该方法避免了VLM微调和大语言模型的使用，仅依赖视觉模型减少对语义表示的依赖，实现了有效的零样本分类

Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification
performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a
major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce.
Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual
models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper
proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM
and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the
set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a
confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier
directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies
high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual
representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier,
allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without
supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large
language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on
semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

Motivation: 现有方法在含镜面环境中表现不佳，主要关注镜面表面的对称映射而忽略了镜面反射携带的丰富信息。镜面反射可以提供补充视角，填补缺失细节并显著提升重建质量。

Method: 提出了ReflectiveGS方法，基于3D高斯泼溅技术，将镜面反射作为补充视角而非简单的对称伪影，从而增强场景几何并恢复缺失细节。

Conclusion: ReflectiveGS为含镜面环境中的3D重建设立了新的基准，证明了利用镜面反射作为补充视角的有效性。

Abstract: Mirror-containing environments pose unique challenges for 3D reconstruction
and novel view synthesis (NVS), as reflective surfaces introduce view-dependent
distortions and inconsistencies. While cutting-edge methods such as Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical
scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing
solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but
often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These
reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details
and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction
in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset
featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror
masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in
reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of
3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary
viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and
recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that
ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and
training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich
environments.

Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in
gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard
for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the
advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the
laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a
significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury,
it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct.
This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach
for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired
during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of
an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed.
Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the
training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical
considerations.

Thus, with varying prompt configurations, Prompt-DAS can perform unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) and weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA), as well
as interactive segmentation during testing. Unlike the foundation model SAM,
which necessitates a prompt for each individual object instance, Prompt-DAS is
only trained on a small dataset and can utilize full points on all instances,
sparse points on partial instances, or even no points at all, facilitated by
the incorporation of an auxiliary center-point detection task. Moreover, a
novel prompt-guided contrastive learning is proposed to enhance discriminative
feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing UDA, WDA,
and SAM-based approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了VIR-Bench基准测试，包含200个旅行视频，用于评估多模态大语言模型在长距离地理时空轨迹理解方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基准主要关注室内场景或短距离户外活动，缺乏对长距离旅行挑战的探索，而掌握扩展的地理时空轨迹对于下一代MLLMs至关重要。

Method: 构建包含200个旅行视频的VIR-Bench基准，将行程重建作为评估任务，并开发原型旅行规划代理来验证基准的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，包括专有模型在内的最先进MLLMs都难以获得高分，凸显了处理跨越扩展空间和时间尺度视频的难度。

Conclusion: VIR-Bench不仅有效评估模型性能，还能转化为用户应用中具体的性能提升，验证了评估协议的实际价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new
possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus
largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the
challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering
extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation
MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and
navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark
consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a
challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs'
geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high
scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended
spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in
which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights
gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations
verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but
also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言推理方法通常在粗粒度级别使用推理链，难以进行细粒度结构化推理，且难以评估中间推理的质量和奖励。

Result: 模型在具有挑战性的视觉语言基准测试中取得了显著改进，建立了强大的基线。

Conclusion: 本文为视觉语言模型提供了基准，并为更复杂的多模态推理提供了见解，相关数据和代码将开源。

Abstract: Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an
open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ
reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform
fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to
evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we
delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling
assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective
reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We
present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the
step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement
learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong
baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language
benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and
ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing
properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a
baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex
multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出一种弱监督的食品图像语义分割方法，结合SAM的零样本能力和ViT的注意力机制，仅使用图像级标注实现像素级分割


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用SAM的零样本分割能力和ViT的注意力机制，减少对像素级标注的依赖，加速食品图像标注过程

Method: 使用Swin Transformer生成类激活图作为SAM的提示，结合图像预处理技术和单/多掩码生成策略，在FoodSeg103数据集上评估

Result: 平均每张图像生成2.4个掩码（不包括背景），多掩码场景下达到0.54的mIoU

Conclusion: 该方法可作为加速食品图像标注的工具，或集成到食品营养追踪应用中

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach
for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and
promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention
mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation
maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable
for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained
exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level
annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the
SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in
combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The
methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of
2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for
the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to
accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food
and nutrition tracking applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyL-UNet是一种基于动态学习的时序一致性U-Net分割架构，旨在实现超声心动图分割的时间稳定性和精确性，通过构建回声动态图和心脏相位动态注意力机制来解决帧间分割抖动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图容易变形和产生斑点噪声，导致帧间分割抖动。即使单帧分割精度很高，时间不稳定性也会削弱功能估计并影响临床可解释性。

Method: 提出DyL-UNet框架，通过动态学习构建回声动态图提取视频动态信息，采用多个基于Swin-Transformer的编码器-解码器分支处理单帧图像，并在跳跃连接处引入心脏相位动态注意力机制来强制时序一致性。

Result: 在CAMUS和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上的广泛实验表明，DyL-UNet在保持与现有方法相当的分割精度的同时，实现了更优的时间一致性。

Conclusion: DyL-UNet为自动化临床超声心动图提供了可靠的解决方案，能够实现时间稳定且精确的分割。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. Yet echocardiography is prone to
deformation and speckle noise, causing frame-to-frame segmentation jitter. Even
with high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can
weaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address
these issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal
consistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally
stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an
Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic
information from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based
encoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further
introduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections,
which uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce
temporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS
and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation
accuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal
consistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical
echocardiography.

Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型在视觉对抗场景中的鲁棒性，特别是模拟色盲测试的复杂视觉环境，以发现模型在真实世界应用中的局限性。

Method: 创建包含500张石原色盲测试风格图像的数据集，数字范围0-99，使用是/否和开放式提示评估9个视觉语言模型，并与人类参与者进行对比。

Result: 实验显示视觉语言模型在对抗性环境中解释数字的能力存在局限，普遍存在幻觉问题，表现不如人类参与者。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了改进视觉语言模型在复杂视觉环境中鲁棒性的必要性，ColorBlindnessEval可作为评估和提高模型可靠性的重要工具。

Abstract: This paper presents ColorBlindnessEval, a novel benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in visually
adversarial scenarios inspired by the Ishihara color blindness test. Our
dataset comprises 500 Ishihara-like images featuring numbers from 0 to 99 with
varying color combinations, challenging VLMs to accurately recognize numerical
information embedded in complex visual patterns. We assess 9 VLMs using Yes/No
and open-ended prompts and compare their performance with human participants.
Our experiments reveal limitations in the models' ability to interpret numbers
in adversarial contexts, highlighting prevalent hallucination issues. These
findings underscore the need to improve the robustness of VLMs in complex
visual environments. ColorBlindnessEval serves as a valuable tool for
benchmarking and improving the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications
where accuracy is critical.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveletGaussian是一种高效稀疏视图3D高斯对象重建框架，通过将扩散过程转移到小波域，仅在低分辨率LL子带应用扩散，高频子带使用轻量网络优化，显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在稀疏视图设置下性能急剧下降，现有方法使用扩散模型修复损坏的渲染图作为伪真值，但计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出小波域扩散方法：在低分辨率LL子带应用扩散，高频子带使用轻量网络优化；采用高效的在线随机掩码策略替代低效的留一法来准备训练数据。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和OmniObject3D两个基准数据集上的实验表明，WaveletGaussian在保持竞争性渲染质量的同时大幅减少训练时间。

Conclusion: WaveletGaussian框架通过小波域扩散和高效训练策略，实现了稀疏视图3D高斯重建的高效优化。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for
image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in
sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing
diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo
ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur
heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present
WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object
reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain:
diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while
high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further
propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs
for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient,
leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360
and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality
while substantially reducing training time.

TL;DR: Sa2VA-i是对Sa2VA模型的改进版本，通过修复训练和推理过程中的不一致性问题，在多个视频分割基准上实现了新的最先进性能，提升幅度最高达+11.6 J&F。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现Sa2VA模型在视频对象分割任务中未能充分发挥潜力，主要原因是训练和推理过程存在不一致性。

Method: 提出Sa2VA-i模型，通过修正训练和推理过程中的不一致性问题来改进原Sa2VA模型。

Result: Sa2VA-i在多个视频基准上创下新纪录：MeViS提升+11.6 J&F，Ref-YT-VOS提升+1.4，Ref-DAVIS提升+3.3，ReVOS提升+4.1。Sa2VA-i-1B模型在MeViS基准上与原始Sa2VA-26B模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了看似微不足道的实现细节的重要性，为视频分割领域提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Sa2VA is a recent model for language-guided dense grounding in images and
video that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple segmentation
benchmarks and that has become widely popular. However, we found that Sa2VA
does not perform according to its full potential for referring video object
segmentation tasks. We identify inconsistencies between training and inference
procedures as the key factor holding it back. To mitigate this issue, we
propose an improved version of Sa2VA, Sa2VA-i, that rectifies these issues and
improves the results. In fact, Sa2VA-i sets a new state of the art for multiple
video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on
Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA
checkpoints. With our fixes, the Sa2VA-i-1B model even performs on par with the
original Sa2VA-26B model on the MeViS benchmark. We hope that this work will
show the importance of seemingly trivial implementation details and that it
will provide valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field. We

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，将多光谱数据作为零样本输入引入到仅训练于RGB数据的通用多模态模型中，让这些模型能够理解专业的多光谱信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱图像在遥感应用中很重要，但现有的机器学习模型需要专门训练，成本高。通用多模态模型虽然强大，但无法理解多光谱信号。

Method: 利用多模态模型对视觉空间的理解，将多光谱数据适配到该空间，并将领域特定信息作为指令注入模型。以Gemini2.5模型为例进行验证。

Result: 在土地覆盖和土地利用分类的遥感基准测试中，该方法实现了显著的零样本性能提升，展示了Gemini2.5对新输入的易适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法使地理空间专业人员能够轻松利用强大的多模态模型来处理非标准专业输入，加速工作流程并受益于其丰富的推理能力。

Abstract: Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing
applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and
urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional
spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such
as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,
and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,
only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is
predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for
multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,
although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs
cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are
capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand
specialized multi-spectral signals.
  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new
multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist
multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the
multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to
inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions
into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe
strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing
benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy
adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential
for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to
easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate
their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities,
grounded in the specialized sensor data.

Method: 提出新颖的多模态训练方法，集成检测、分割和多模态链式推理，开发统一的数据套件覆盖推理、检测、分割和文档理解任务。

Result: Citrus-V在多个基准测试中优于现有开源医学模型和专家级成像系统，支持精确病变量化、自动报告生成和可靠第二意见。

Conclusion: Citrus-V提供了从视觉定位到临床推理的统一流程，为临床诊断、治疗规划和手术决策提供强大支持。

Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment
planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly
focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their
generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit
strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications
demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought
reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that
combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection,
segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level
lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like
diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal
training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering
reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks.
Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical
models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering
a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting
precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second
opinions.

Motivation: 交通安全是全球重要问题，需要及时准确的事故检测来减少危害和快速应急响应。基础设施视觉传感器提供可扩展的实时监控解决方案，但缺乏多样化的真实事故数据。

Method: 使用CARLA模拟的DeepAccident数据集评估MLLMs的零样本能力；比较Gemini 1.5/2.0、Gemma 3和Pixtral模型；集成YOLO、Deep SORT和SAM等视觉分析技术增强提示以提高准确性。

Result: Pixtral表现最佳（F1-score 0.71，召回率83%）；Gemini模型通过增强提示提高了精度（如Gemini 1.5达90%），但F1和召回率下降；Gemma 3性能最平衡。

Conclusion: MLLMs与先进视觉分析技术结合在自动化交通监控系统中具有巨大应用潜力，能够有效提升事故检测能力。

Abstract: Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate
accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response.
Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for
continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci-
dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and
describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus
minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include:
(1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA,
explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based
accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance
analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent
identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3)
Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object
detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for
instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and
explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an
F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with
enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and
recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal
metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of
integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their
applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期点跟踪问题，要求在处理显著外观变化、运动和遮挡时保持跨视频帧的点一致性，特别针对在线实时和流媒体应用场景。

Method: 扩展Track-On模型为Track-On2，采用因果处理框架和内存机制保持时序一致性，通过粗粒度补丁级分类和细化进行推理，并系统研究合成训练对内存行为的影响。

Result: 在五个合成和真实世界基准测试中取得最先进结果，超越现有在线跟踪器甚至利用双向上下文的强离线方法。

Conclusion: 基于因果内存架构和纯合成数据训练的方法为真实世界点跟踪提供了可扩展的有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which
requires consistent identification of points across video frames under
significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online
setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time
and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2,
a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking.
Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural
refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training
strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or
iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal
coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions
without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level
classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically
study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing
how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive
experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong
offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the
effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic
data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking. Project page:

Abstract: We introduce KAMERA: a comprehensive system for multi-camera, multi-spectral
synchronization and real-time detection of seals and polar bears. Utilized in
aerial surveys for ice-associated seals in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort
seas around Alaska, KAMERA provides up to an 80% reduction in dataset
processing time over previous methods. Our rigorous calibration and hardware
synchronization enable using multiple spectra for object detection. All
collected data are annotated with metadata so they can be easily referenced
later. All imagery and animal detections from a survey are mapped onto a world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脉冲神经网络在边缘设备上部署时面临的高延迟、高能耗问题，以及边缘-云协同推理系统中的高延迟和特征传输成本问题。

Method: 引入学习型脉冲驱动压缩模块减少数据传输，采用动态早退机制根据输出置信度自适应终止推理，在真实边缘到云测试平台上进行原型验证。

Result: 数据传输减少高达2048倍，边缘能耗降低超过90%，端到端延迟相比纯边缘推理降低3倍，准确率损失小于2%。

Conclusion: NeuCODEX能够在资源受限环境中实现实用、高性能的SNN部署。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling
energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN
inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy
constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud
co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is
often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these
issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that
jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a
learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs
a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on
output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and
Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To
demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16
backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data
transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing
end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a
negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables
practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather
conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses
contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces
noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with
degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded
regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective
supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these
challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual
foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature
representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene
correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than
relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we
create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These
datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic
context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this
knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of
two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse
weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from
clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under
adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌是致命疾病，始于结肠内壁息肉生长。结肠镜检查是标准检测方法，但人工检测存在不一致性和遗漏风险。深度学习目标检测可以提供更准确、实时的诊断解决方案。

Method: 提出YOLO-LAN息肉检测管道，使用M2IoU损失函数、多样化数据增强技术和负样本训练来模拟真实临床情况。基于YOLOv12和YOLOv8架构进行优化。

Result: 在Kvasir-seg和BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp数据集上优于现有方法：YOLOv12达到mAP50 0.9619、mAP50:95 0.8599；YOLOv8达到mAP50 0.9540、mAP50:95 0.8487。在息肉大小和精确定位检测方面表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: YOLO-LAN在息肉检测精度上显著提升，特别是在mAP50:95指标上，证明了其在AI辅助结直肠筛查中的临床相关性。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC), a lethal disease, begins with the growth of abnormal
mucosal cell proliferation called polyps in the inner wall of the colon. When
left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the
standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and
removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be
inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on
deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time
diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based
polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data
augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our
pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp
datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12
and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg
dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing
the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and
precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted
colorectal screening.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的视觉处理机制，基于人类视觉的双流假说将视觉处理分解为物体识别和空间感知两个独立研究，并提出了提升解码效率和空间推理能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs通过序列化图像处理视觉信息，这与人类视觉的并行处理方式存在差异，且其不透明的内部机制阻碍了深入理解和架构创新。

Method: 将视觉处理分解为物体识别（通过将图像转换为文本标记图分析）和空间感知（理论推导和实证验证位置表示的几何结构），并提出了基于即插即用视觉解码器的指令无关标记压缩算法和RoPE缩放技术。

Result: 研究发现模型对图像内容的感知是从浅层到深层的两阶段过程（属性识别到语义消歧），验证了VLMs中位置表示的几何结构，提出的方法有效提升了解码效率和空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 该工作验证了对VLM内部机制的分析，为深入理解VLMs和设计更强大的未来架构提供了清晰原则。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual
information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from
the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms
hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the
dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and
"where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object
recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition,
we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of
image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers,
beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic
disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically
verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in
VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token
compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve
decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning.
Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a
deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for
designing more capable future architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对比学习视觉语言模型（如CLIP）存在的浅层语言理解、模态差距问题，以及大规模网络数据训练带来的计算成本和隐私问题。

Method: 采用无视觉的单编码器检索流程，将文本到图像检索范式迁移到文本到文本范式，利用VLLM生成结构化图像描述，仅需少量GPU时间进行校准。

Result: 该方法在多个检索和组合性基准测试中达到最先进的零样本性能，模型参数仅需0.3B，性能优于传统多模态模型。

Conclusion: 无视觉检索器在减少模态差距、提高组合性和保护隐私方面具有显著优势，为检索任务提供了更高效和隐私友好的替代方案。

Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have
become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language
representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language
understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are
reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap.
Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training
makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy
concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the
necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free,
single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image
retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance
of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this
paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of
the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short
and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration
on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions
introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess
generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality
benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO,
containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin
subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses
traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and
compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters. Code is

TL;DR: 本文研究了对比视觉语言模型（VLMs）中组合性与长标题理解之间的双向关系，发现组合性训练能提升长标题检索性能，而长标题训练也能促进组合性，但效果受数据质量和模型设计影响。


<details>

Motivation: 当前对比视觉语言模型在绑定视觉和文本信息方面取得进展，但理解长而密集的标题仍是一个挑战。作者假设组合性（即推理对象属性绑定和对象间关系的能力）是理解长标题的关键。

Method: 作者训练和评估了一系列针对组合性和长标题理解能力的模型，研究了不同训练策略（如冻结位置嵌入）和数据质量对模型性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现组合性训练和长标题训练之间存在双向促进关系，但这种增益对数据质量和模型设计敏感。高质量的长标题数据训练可以使模型在两项任务上都取得强劲表现。

Conclusion: 组合性理解和长标题理解是相互交织的能力，可以通过在密集、接地气的描述上进行训练来共同学习。高质量的长标题数据训练为改进VLM泛化提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
binding visual and textual information, but understanding long, dense captions
remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity
to reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is
key to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking
whether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a
range of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a
bidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on
long-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes
compositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model
design. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited
parameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that
aim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do
not improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional
understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that
can be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions.
Despite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality,
long-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering
practical guidance for improving VLM generalization.

Abstract: Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery remains a significant
challenge for high throughput field phenotyping, particularly in outdoor
environments where low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent
occlusions hinder performance. To address this, we present a framework that
leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and
GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal
images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures
of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop
and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as
five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using
various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few
labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the
weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline.
Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using
CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results
demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and
cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost
segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

Abstract: Evaluation of hydrocephalus in children is challenging, and the related
research is limited by a lack of publicly available, expert-annotated datasets,
particularly those with segmentation of the choroid plexus. To address this, we
present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with
hydrocephalus. 3D MRIs were provided with 1mm isotropic resolution, which was
reconstructed from routine low-resolution images using a slice-to-volume
algorithm. Manually corrected segmentations of brain tissues, including white
matter, grey matter, lateral ventricle, external CSF, and the choroid plexus,
were provided by an experienced neurologist. Additionally, structured data was
extracted from clinical radiology reports using a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation framework. The strong correlation between choroid plexus volume and
total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation,
achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The
proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging
algorithms development, and it revealed the choroid plexus-related features in
hydrocephalus assessments. Our datasets are publicly available at

Conclusion: 消融研究验证了MsFIN中每个模块的有效性，突出了网络如何通过多尺度特征融合和上下文交互建模实现优越性能

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer
vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has
become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges
persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often
occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal
behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a
Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage
accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for
multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale
feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a
Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term,
mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture
is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature
processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under
causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network
fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a
comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show
that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale
feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation
studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how
the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion
and contextual interaction modeling.

Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses
significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse
evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection
capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types
of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with
limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned
forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant
and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously
evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical
infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face
forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to
develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual
experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and
refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental
information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting,
we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the
established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the
orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the
training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and
manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频相似度评估通常依赖全局相似度分数，无法像人类那样从多个角度（如动作、场景等）进行细粒度比较。大型多模态模型的出现为利用自然语言进行视频比较任务提供了新机会。

Method: 引入ConViS任务框架，使用预定义语义概念集计算视频对的相似度分数；构建ConViS-Bench基准数据集，包含精心标注的视频对及其概念级相似度分数和文本描述；对多个先进模型进行基准测试。

Result: 不同模型在ConViS任务上表现出显著性能差异，某些概念对视频相似度估计更具挑战性。

Conclusion: ConViS-Bench将成为推动语言驱动视频理解研究的重要资源，该任务支持概念条件视频检索等新应用。

Abstract: What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar
when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated
based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare
videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been
thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on
broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video
understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural
language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video
Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by
computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key
semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video
similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video
retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new
benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains.
Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions
of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several
state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with
human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on
ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating
video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable
resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.

Abstract: Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer
vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient
compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion
dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework
with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while
preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense
motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates
reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment
observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic
dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming
the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%.
Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion
complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a
compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much
larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish
practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实体肿瘤影像学中可靠区分恶性病变与混淆病理的挑战，传统放射组学方法往往忽略了复杂的空间关系，需要更有效的方法来捕捉病灶内异质性。

Method: GrRAiL方法包括两个步骤：(1)使用逐体素放射组学测量识别亚区域聚类，(2)计算图论指标来量化聚类间的空间关联，生成加权图编码病灶内高阶空间关系。

Result: 在947名受试者的多中心评估中，GrRAiL在三个临床应用场景中均显著优于现有方法：胶质母细胞瘤复发与假性进展区分（测试准确率78%，提升>10%）、脑转移瘤复发与放射性坏死区分（测试准确率74%，提升>13%）、胰腺IPMN风险分层（测试准确率75%，提升>10%）。

Conclusion: GrRAiL能够有效捕捉病灶内异质性，在区分恶性病变与混淆病理方面表现出优越性能，具有临床可行性，为肿瘤影像诊断提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing
confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While
radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI,
many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex
spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new
Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional
heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of
sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes
graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The
resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the
ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies
from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was
evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor
recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain
metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional
setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In
GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs
pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over
comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs
radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk
stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10%
improvement.

TL;DR: CLOPS是首个仅使用自我中心视觉感知环境并导航的人类化身，通过将低级运动技能学习与基于视觉输入的高级控制学习解耦，实现了人类化运动特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类运动生成方法忽视了感知与运动之间的相互依赖关系，使用的感知方式与人类截然不同。作者认为生成人类化化身行为需要人类化感知。

Method: 首先在大型运动捕捉数据集上训练运动先验模型，然后使用Q学习训练策略，将自我中心视觉输入映射到运动先验的高级控制命令。

Result: 实验证明自我中心视觉能够使化身产生人类化运动特征，例如化身会避开视觉场中的障碍物行走。

Conclusion: 为化身配备人类化传感器（特别是自我中心视觉）有望训练出行为像人类的化身。

Abstract: The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is
how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human
motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific
``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the
generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception.
Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely
uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision
as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge
for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion,
without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by
decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level
control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model
on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning
to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion
prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give
rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the
avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field.
These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors,
particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave
like humans.

TL;DR: 该论文针对布局到图像生成中边界框重叠问题，提出了OverLayScore量化指标和OverLayBench基准，并开发了CreatiLayout-AM模型来解决重叠区域的生成质量下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前布局到图像生成方法在处理边界框显著重叠的布局时表现不佳，特别是在大重叠区域和语义区分度小的重叠实例上存在挑战。现有基准偏向简单案例，无法有效评估模型在挑战性条件下的性能。

Method: 1) 提出OverLayScore指标量化边界框重叠复杂度；2) 构建OverLayBench基准，包含高质量标注和平衡的OverLayScore分布；3) 开发CreatiLayout-AM模型，在精选的amodal掩码数据集上进行微调。

Result: 分析显示现有基准存在偏向低OverLayScore值的偏差，限制了评估模型在挑战性条件下的有效性。提出的OverLayBench提供了更全面的评估框架。

Conclusion: 该研究为在现实和挑战性场景下实现更鲁棒的布局到图像生成奠定了基础，通过新指标、基准和改进模型解决了重叠边界框的关键问题。

Abstract: Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still
struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We
identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2)
overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both
qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these
factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we
introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of
overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are
biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their
effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging
conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark
featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different
levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on
complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a
curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for
more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging
scenarios. Project link: https://mlpc-ucsd.github.io/OverLayBench.

*Weijie Wang,Yeqing Chen,Zeyu Zhang,Hengyu Liu,Haoxiao Wang,Zhiyuan Feng,Wenkang Qin,Zheng Zhu,Donny Y. Chen,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VolSplat提出了一种新的多视角前馈3D高斯泼溅方法，用体素对齐高斯取代像素对齐高斯，解决了现有方法对输入视角数量的依赖、视角偏差密度分布和对齐误差等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于像素对齐的高斯预测方法存在三个主要限制：重建的3D模型严重依赖输入视角数量、产生视角偏差的密度分布、在源视图存在遮挡或低纹理时引入对齐误差。

Method: VolSplat直接从预测的3D体素网格预测高斯，避免了像素对齐对易出错的2D特征匹配的依赖，确保多视角一致性，并能基于3D场景复杂度自适应控制高斯密度。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和ScanNet等基准测试中，VolSplat实现了最先进的性能，产生更合理和视角一致的高斯重建，渲染质量得到提升。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅取得了优越的结果，还为前馈3D重建建立了一个更可扩展的框架，具有更密集和更鲁棒的表示，为更广泛社区的研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective
solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a
pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a
3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several
inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent
on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and
introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions
or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new
multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with
voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D
voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature
matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables
adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding
more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and
enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent
Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach
establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with
denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in
wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on
our project page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat.

TL;DR: CAR-Flow是一种条件感知重参数化方法，通过调整源分布和目标分布来缩短概率路径，从而加速流匹配模型的训练并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的条件生成建模方法需要模型同时学习质量传输和条件注入，这增加了模型的学习负担。为了减轻模型负担，作者提出了条件感知重参数化方法。

Method: CAR-Flow通过学习一个轻量级的位移来调整源分布（标准高斯噪声）、目标分布（条件数据分布）或两者，从而缩短概率路径。该方法引入的参数少于0.6%。

Result: 在低维合成数据上可视化并量化了CAR的效果。在ImageNet-256上，将CAR-Flow应用于SiT-XL/2模型，FID从2.07降至1.68，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: CAR-Flow通过简单而有效的方式优化了条件生成建模的训练过程，在几乎不增加参数的情况下显著提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution
from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and
flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a
learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that
ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence
required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the
demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow
Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source,
the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow
shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training
in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the
effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256),
equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while
introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个成本效益分析框架，帮助组织确定何时本地部署开源LLM比商业订阅服务更经济可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织在使用AI时面临选择商业LLM服务还是本地部署的决策。虽然云服务提供商提供先进模型和易扩展性，但数据隐私、供应商锁定和长期运营成本等问题推动了本地开源模型部署的需求。

Method: 通过分析硬件需求、运营费用和最新开源模型（如Qwen、Llama、Mistral等）的性能基准，并将本地部署总成本与主要云提供商的订阅费用进行比较。

Result: 研究提供了基于使用水平和性能需求的盈亏平衡点估计。

Conclusion: 结果为组织规划LLM战略提供了实用的决策框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread.
Organizations that want to use AI for productivity now face an important
decision. They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on
their own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI,
Anthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to
state-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data
privacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating
costs have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This
paper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations
determine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared
to commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements,
operational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source
models, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost
of deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription
fee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels
and performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework
for planning their LLM strategies.

TL;DR: SPADE是一个利用大型语言模型进行土壤湿度时间序列分析的集成框架，能够检测灌溉模式和异常，无需特定任务标注或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有土壤湿度时间序列分析方法要么依赖基于阈值的规则，要么需要大量数据的机器学习模型，存在适应性和可解释性限制。

Method: 利用ChatGPT-4.1的推理能力，将时间序列数据转换为文本表示，通过领域知识提示模板识别灌溉事件、估计净灌溉增益、检测和分类异常。

Result: 在真实农场数据上的实验表明，SPADE在异常检测方面优于现有方法，召回率和F1分数更高，灌溉事件检测精度和召回率也很高。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为精准农业的可扩展、适应性工具，整合定性知识和数据驱动推理，为土壤湿度监测和灌溉调度提供可操作的见解。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of soil moisture patterns is critical for irrigation
scheduling and crop management, yet existing approaches for soil moisture
time-series analysis either rely on threshold-based rules or data-hungry
machine learning or deep learning models that are limited in adaptability and
interpretability. In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and
Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil
moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced
reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis
without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting
time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed
prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation
gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable
reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data
from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the
United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method
in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately
classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and
recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to
capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide
interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study
highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision
agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and
data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture
monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series
data.

*Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了可解释不确定性估计（XUE）框架，将可解释性与不确定性量化相结合，以增强医疗AI的可信度和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗AI系统未能明确量化或传达与临床推理相符的不确定性，现有可解释AI（XAI）工作缺乏对预测置信度的捕捉，而不确定性估计（UE）技术又缺乏直观解释，这种脱节限制了AI在医学中的应用。

Method: 通过系统地将医学不确定性映射到AI不确定性概念，识别XUE实施的关键挑战，并提出了包括多模态不确定性量化、模型无关可视化技术和不确定性感知决策支持系统在内的技术方向。

Result: 提出了XUE框架和实现指南原则，强调了AI系统不仅需要生成可靠预测，还需要以临床有意义的方式表达置信度水平。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过桥接可解释性和不确定性，为开发可信赖的医疗AI做出贡献，为与现实世界临床复杂性相一致的AI系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in medical practice, but current
medical AI systems fail to explicitly quantify or communicate uncertainty in a
way that aligns with clinical reasoning. Existing XAI works focus on
interpreting model predictions but do not capture the confidence or reliability
of these predictions. Conversely, uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques
provide confidence measures but lack intuitive explanations. The disconnect
between these two areas limits AI adoption in medicine. To address this gap, we
propose Explainable Uncertainty Estimation (XUE) that integrates explainability
with uncertainty quantification to enhance trust and usability in medical AI.
We systematically map medical uncertainty to AI uncertainty concepts and
identify key challenges in implementing XUE. We outline technical directions
for advancing XUE, including multimodal uncertainty quantification,
model-agnostic visualization techniques, and uncertainty-aware decision support
systems. Lastly, we propose guiding principles to ensure effective XUE
realisation. Our analysis highlights the need for AI systems that not only
generate reliable predictions but also articulate confidence levels in a
clinically meaningful way. This work contributes to the development of
trustworthy medical AI by bridging explainability and uncertainty, paving the
way for AI systems that are aligned with real-world clinical complexities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文档语义解析面临二次复杂度增长和内存需求大的挑战，需要一种可扩展的解决方案来支持超长文本的实时处理。

Method: HSGM将输入文档分解为M个段落，在每个段落上构建局部语义图，提取摘要节点形成全局图记忆，支持增量更新和分层查询处理。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，HSGM实现了2-4倍推理加速，峰值内存减少超过60%，同时保持≥95%的基线准确率。

Conclusion: HSGM为超长文本提供了可扩展、准确的语义建模方法，使实时和资源受限的NLP应用成为可能。

Abstract: Semantic parsing of long documents remains challenging due to quadratic
growth in pairwise composition and memory requirements. We introduce
\textbf{Hierarchical Segment-Graph Memory (HSGM)}, a novel framework that
decomposes an input of length $N$ into $M$ meaningful segments, constructs
\emph{Local Semantic Graphs} on each segment, and extracts compact
\emph{summary nodes} to form a \emph{Global Graph Memory}. HSGM supports
\emph{incremental updates} -- only newly arrived segments incur local graph
construction and summary-node integration -- while \emph{Hierarchical Query
Processing} locates relevant segments via top-$K$ retrieval over summary nodes
and then performs fine-grained reasoning within their local graphs.
  Theoretically, HSGM reduces worst-case complexity from $O(N^2)$ to
$O\!\left(N\,k + (N/k)^2\right)$, with segment size $k \ll N$, and we derive
Frobenius-norm bounds on the approximation error introduced by node
summarization and sparsification thresholds. Empirically, on three benchmarks
-- long-document AMR parsing, segment-level semantic role labeling (OntoNotes),
and legal event extraction -- HSGM achieves \emph{2--4$\times$ inference
speedup}, \emph{$>60\%$ reduction} in peak memory, and \emph{$\ge 95\%$} of
baseline accuracy. Our approach unlocks scalable, accurate semantic modeling
for ultra-long texts, enabling real-time and resource-constrained NLP
applications.

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in
engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create
significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a
multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow
from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical
gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation:
Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline,
including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of
handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic
generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via
ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent,
the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as
discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other
agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3.
High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a
Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a
dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2%
success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing
frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the
expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems
can democratize complex scientific computing. The code is public at

Abstract: Operations research (OR) provides fundamental methodologies for complex
system decision-making, with established applications in transportation, supply
chain management, and production scheduling. Traditional approaches, which
depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face
challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these
limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and
reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into
mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms,
and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on
the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions:
automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further
reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes
key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented
research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems.
Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role
of LLMs in OR.

Conclusion: 该研究为准确预测网约车模式选择提供了强大工具，其方法论可轻松转移到各种应用中。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of ridesourcing mode choices is essential for designing and
implementing effective traffic management policies for reducing congestion,
improving mobility, and allocating resources more efficiently. Existing models
for predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive
accuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are
further challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise
only a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting
Actions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict
ridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler
personas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model
on demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce
an individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to
theory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final
classifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their
interaction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode
choice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing
choice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set.
This study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode
choices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数教育推荐系统仅基于点击或评分相关性进行调优和判断，其真实的教学影响不明确。需要一种能够直接评估推荐系统对学习成果影响的方法。

Method: OBER采用极简的实体关系模型、基于日志的掌握度公式和插件架构。在非正式学习领域的电子学习系统中进行了为期两周的随机分组测试，比较了固定专家路径、协同过滤和基于知识的过滤三种方法。

Result: 协同过滤最大化了用户留存率，但固定路径实现了最高的掌握度。OBER可以从相同日志中导出业务、相关性和学习指标，让从业者无需额外测试就能权衡相关性和参与度与成果掌握度。

Abstract: Most educational recommender systems are tuned and judged on click- or
rating-based relevance, leaving their true pedagogical impact unclear. We
introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning

can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist
entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in
architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was
evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners
across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF),
and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path
achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and
learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and
engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The
framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or
context-aware recommenders.

*Rui Liu,Zikang Wang,Peng Gao,Yu Shen,Pratap Tokekar,Ming Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MMCD框架，通过多模态协作决策和跨模态知识蒸馏解决自动驾驶中传感器故障或协作车辆缺失时的鲁棒性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶系统在传感器故障或协作车辆缺失时性能下降，需要一种能够在模态不完整情况下保持鲁棒性的决策框架

Method: 使用教师-学生模型结构进行跨模态知识蒸馏，教师模型训练时使用完整多模态数据，学生模型设计为在模态减少时仍能有效运行

Result: 在连接自主地面车辆和空地车辆协作实验中，该方法将驾驶安全性提高了20.7%，在潜在事故检测和安全驾驶决策方面超越现有最佳基线

Conclusion: MMCD框架通过多模态融合和知识蒸馏技术，显著提升了自动驾驶系统在现实复杂环境中的鲁棒性和安全性

Abstract: Autonomous systems have advanced significantly, but challenges persist in
accident-prone environments where robust decision-making is crucial. A single
vehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of
accidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches,
leveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising
solutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data
modalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is
impractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal
Collaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses
multi-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance
decision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when
certain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach
based on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model
structure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while
the student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities.
In experiments on $\textit{connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles}$
and $\textit{aerial-ground vehicles collaboration}$, our method improves
driving safety by up to ${\it 20.7}\%$, surpassing the best-existing baseline
in detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions. More

*Timotheus Kampik,Kristijonas Čyras,José Ruiz Alarcón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种形式化方法来解释定量双极论证框架（QBAF）中推理变化的原因。当从QBAF得出结论并更新QBAF后再次得出结论时，该方法追踪语义在感兴趣参数（主题参数）上建立的部分顺序中强度不一致的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态论证框架中，当更新QBAF后，参数强度的排序可能会发生变化（强度不一致），需要一种系统的方法来追踪和解释这些变化的原因。

Method: 将强度不一致的原因追溯到特定参数，识别充分、必要和反事实解释。定义基于启发式的方法来促进强度不一致解释的搜索，并提供实现。

Result: 证明了强度不一致解释存在的充要条件是更新导致强度不一致。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解释QBAF中推理变化的原因，为动态论证系统提供了可解释性支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a formal approach to explaining change of inference in
Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs). When drawing conclusions
from a QBAF and updating the QBAF to then again draw conclusions (and so on),
our approach traces changes -- which we call strength inconsistencies -- in the
partial order over argument strengths that a semantics establishes on some
arguments of interest, called topic arguments. We trace the causes of strength
inconsistencies to specific arguments, which then serve as explanations. We
identify sufficient, necessary, and counterfactual explanations for strength
inconsistencies and show that strength inconsistency explanations exist if and
only if an update leads to strength inconsistency. We define a heuristic-based
approach to facilitate the search for strength inconsistency explanations, for
which we also provide an implementation.

### [134] [nDNA -- the Semantic Helix of Artificial Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18216)
*Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Neural DNA（nDNA）作为捕捉AI基础模型潜在认知身份的语义-基因型表示，通过内在几何结构来表征模型的"灵魂"，而非仅仅关注输出行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试只衡量模型行为，但模型的本质存在于其潜在几何结构中。需要一种能够捕捉模型内在认知身份的方法，类似于生物DNA能够编码遗传信息。

Method: nDNA基于三个几何维度构建：谱曲率（揭示概念流在层间的弯曲）、热力学长度（量化语义转换所需的努力）、信念向量场（描述引导模型信念方向的语义扭转场）。

Result: nDNA提供了稳定、坐标系无关的神经网络DNA指纹，能够追踪模型在预训练、微调、对齐等过程中的谱系，测量检查点间的继承关系，检测数据或目标变化下的漂移。

Conclusion: 这项工作开启了神经基因组学新领域，将AI模型视为具有可追踪内在认知的数字语义有机体，为比较模型、诊断风险和治理认知演化提供了新方法。

Abstract: As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What
shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output?
Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent
geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic
representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic
geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and
indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals
the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which
quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational
transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the
semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations.
Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance,
found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural
drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not
just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.
  Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid--dynamics:
meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is
the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how
meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free
neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we
cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning,
alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between
checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and,
ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models,
diagnose risks, and govern change over time.

### [135] [Similarity Field Theory: A Mathematical Framework for Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18218)
*Kei-Sing Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了相似性场理论，这是一个数学框架，用于形式化实体间相似性关系及其演化的原则。该理论定义了相似性场、系统演化、概念纤维和生成算子，并基于此形式化地定义了智能的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者认为持久化和转换相似性关系是任何可理解动态系统的结构基础，需要建立一个数学框架来形式化相似性值及其演化的原则。

Method: 定义了相似性场S: U×U→[0,1]，系统演化序列Z_p=(X_p,S^(p))，概念纤维F_α(K)={E∈U|S(E,K)≥α}，以及生成算子G。基于此框架形式化定义了智能的概念。

Result: 证明了两个定理：(i)不对称性阻止相互包含；(ii)稳定性需要锚坐标或最终限制在f的层级集内。这些结果确保了相似性场演化的约束性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 相似性场理论为表征、比较和构建智能系统提供了基础语言，并可用于解释大语言模型和将其作为社会认知的实验探针。

Abstract: We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the
structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces
Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the
principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We
define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of
entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed
relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the
evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by
$p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers
$F_{\alpha}(K) = { E \in U \mid S(E,K) \ge \alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of
the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that
produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative
definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a
concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of
$K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field
Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and
constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks
mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or
eventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the
evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable,
culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large
language models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition.

TL;DR: 提出VL-RiskFormer，一种分层堆叠的视觉-语言多模态Transformer，用于预测个体健康风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着慢性疾病负担增加和多模态临床数据的涌现，需要统一的多模态AI框架来主动预测个体健康风险

Method: 基于双流架构，采用预训练交叉模态对比学习、时间融合块和疾病本体图适配器四个关键创新

Result: 在MIMIC-IV纵向队列中达到平均AUROC 0.90，预期校准误差2.7%

Conclusion: VL-RiskFormer能够有效整合多模态临床数据，实现准确的健康风险预测

Abstract: With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and
heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable
sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI
framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose
VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer
with a large language model (LLM) inference head embedded in its top layer. The
system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic
models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with
cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images,
fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives
using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion
block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer
decoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease
ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels
in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention
mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an
average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChefMind是一个混合架构，结合了探索链、知识图谱、检索增强生成和大语言模型，用于解决个性化食谱推荐中的模糊意图、语义准确性和细节覆盖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化食谱推荐面临处理模糊用户意图、确保语义准确性和提供足够细节覆盖的挑战。

Method: 提出ChefMind混合架构：探索链(CoE)将模糊查询细化为结构化条件，知识图谱(KG)提供语义推理和可解释性，检索增强生成(RAG)补充上下文烹饪细节，大语言模型(LLM)整合输出为连贯推荐。

Result: 在Xiachufang数据集和手动标注查询上的评估显示，ChefMind在准确性、相关性、完整性和清晰度方面表现优异，平均得分8.7，而消融模型为6.4-6.7。未处理查询降至1.6%，证明其在处理模糊需求方面的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ChefMind通过混合架构有效解决了食谱推荐中的关键挑战，在多个指标上显著优于单一方法基线。

Abstract: Personalized recipe recommendation faces challenges in handling fuzzy user
intent, ensuring semantic accuracy, and providing sufficient detail coverage.
We propose ChefMind, a hybrid architecture combining Chain of Exploration
(CoE), Knowledge Graph (KG), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a Large
Language Model (LLM). CoE refines ambiguous queries into structured conditions,
KG offers semantic reasoning and interpretability, RAG supplements contextual
culinary details, and LLM integrates outputs into coherent recommendations. We
evaluate ChefMind on the Xiachufang dataset and manually annotated queries,
comparing it with LLM-only, KG-only, and RAG-only baselines. Results show that
ChefMind achieves superior performance in accuracy, relevance, completeness,
and clarity, with an average score of 8.7 versus 6.4-6.7 for ablation models.
Moreover, it reduces unprocessed queries to 1.6%, demonstrating robustness in
handling fuzzy demands.

*Anthony Patera,Rohan Abeyaratne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种"N+1"GPT代理框架，用于机械工程问题的初始低成本分析。该框架通过多个独立求解代理和比较代理来提高GPT在工程问题求解中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPT在解决机械工程分析问题时存在不可靠性（成功率仅85%），这使得"开箱即用"的GPT不适合直接应用于教育或工程实践。需要一种机制来提高解决方案的可靠性。

Method: 采用"N+1"代理架构：首先启动N个独立求解代理生成N个问题解决方案，然后通过比较代理对这些方案进行总结、比较，并推荐最优解决方案。基于孔多塞陪审团定理，当每个求解代理的成功概率大于1/2且N足够大时，多数解决方案将大概率正确。

Result: 与商业多代理模型Grok Heavy相比，该框架在设计和性能上具有相似性，但更注重透明度和教学价值。比较代理还能整合次要解决方案的优点，特别是当这些方案代表不同的问题解释或数学解法时。

Conclusion: 该代理框架能够显著提高GPT在机械工程问题求解中的可靠性，使其更适合教育和技术实践应用，同时保持了解决方案的透明度和教学价值。

Abstract: Generative AI, and specifically GPT, can produce a remarkable solution to a
mechanical engineering analysis problem - but also, on occasion, a flawed
solution. For example, an elementary mechanics problem is solved flawlessly in
one GPT instance and incorrectly in a subsequent GPT instance, with a success
probability of only 85%. This unreliability renders "out-of-the-box" GPT
unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice. We introduce an
"N-Plus-1" GPT Agency for Initial (Low-Cost) Analysis of mechanical engineering
Problem Statements. Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to
yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes
Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution
Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from
Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by
per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the
Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high
probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore,
Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare)
Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative
Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or
alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures. Comparisons to Grok Heavy, a
commercial multi-agent model, show similarities in design and performance, but
also important differences in emphasis: our Agency focuses on transparency and
pedagogical value.

*Zihan Dong,Xinyu Fan,Zixiang Tang,Yunqing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ComputerAgent是一个轻量级分层强化学习框架，通过两级选项过程（管理器和子策略）控制桌面应用，使用三模态状态编码器处理视觉和上下文多样性，集成元动作和早停机制减少无效交互，小型网络实现设备端推理（1500万参数）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在桌面应用控制中存在推理延迟高、长视野稀疏奖励任务样本效率差、无法设备端部署等问题，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层强化学习框架，将操作系统控制建模为两级选项过程，使用三模态状态编码器（截图、任务ID、数值状态），集成元动作和早停机制，使用紧凑视觉骨干网络和小型策略网络。

Result: 在135个真实桌面任务测试中，简单任务（<8步）成功率92.1%，困难任务（≥8步）成功率58.8%，性能匹配或超越2000亿参数MLLM基线，模型大小减少四个数量级，推理时间减半。

Conclusion: 分层强化学习为计算机控制提供了一个实用、可扩展的替代方案，相比单一MLLM自动化方法更具优势。

Abstract: Controlling desktop applications via software remains a fundamental yet
under-served problem. Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest
screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but
they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on
long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We
introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework,
ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process
(manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task
ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates
meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and
uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device
inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks,
ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on
hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on
simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and
halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a
practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for
computer control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前医疗AI基准测试的局限性，证明高分模型在实际应用中可能表现不佳，强调需要更严格的评估标准来确保AI在医疗领域的真实可靠性。

Method: 对6个旗舰模型在6个广泛使用的医疗基准上进行压力测试，包括移除关键输入、改变提示词等方法，并通过临床医生指导的评估标准进行分析。

Result: 发现领先系统即使在没有关键输入的情况下也能猜对答案，在微小提示变化下会改变答案，并生成有缺陷但看似合理的推理。基准测试得分不能真实反映模型的实际医疗能力。

Conclusion: 医疗基准测试得分不能直接反映AI在真实世界中的准备程度，需要要求系统具备更强的鲁棒性、合理推理能力，并与真实医疗需求保持一致。

Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical
benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often
guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers
under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning.
These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking
tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six
widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness
and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that
benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated
interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark
scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn
trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold
systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real
medical demands.

TL;DR: 本文研究了两种计算约束策略（推理长度约束和模型量化）对推理语言模型安全性能的影响，旨在平衡计算效率与模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时计算扩展虽然能通过生成长链思维序列提升推理模型性能，但带来了显著的计算成本增加。本研究旨在探索在计算约束下保持模型性能和安全性的方法。

Method: 采用两种方法：1）基于长度控制策略优化的强化学习方法微调推理模型以满足用户定义的推理长度；2）应用量化技术，在用户定义的计算约束下最大化链思维序列的生成。

Result: 研究发现计算约束策略可以有效降低推理模型的计算需求，但需要在计算效率与模型安全性之间进行权衡。

Conclusion: 计算约束策略是减少推理模型计算需求的有效方法，但实施时需要仔细考虑其对模型安全性能的影响，以实现计算效率与安全性的平衡。

Abstract: Test-time compute scaling has demonstrated the ability to improve the
performance of reasoning language models by generating longer chain-of-thought
(CoT) sequences. However, this increase in performance comes with a significant
increase in computational cost. In this work, we investigate two compute
constraint strategies: (1) reasoning length constraint and (2) model
quantization, as methods to reduce the compute demand of reasoning models and
study their impact on their safety performance. Specifically, we explore two
approaches to apply compute constraints to reasoning models: (1) fine-tuning
reasoning models using a length controlled policy optimization (LCPO) based
reinforcement learning method to satisfy a user-defined CoT reasoning length,
and (2) applying quantization to maximize the generation of CoT sequences
within a user-defined compute constraint. Furthermore, we study the trade-off
between the computational efficiency and the safety of the model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Gödel测试，评估大型语言模型能否为简单未解数学猜想生成正确证明，并在组合优化领域的五个猜想上测试了GPT-5的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在解决新颖、简单的数学猜想方面的能力，特别是在前沿数学领域，而不仅仅是已知的数学竞赛问题。

Method: 设计Gödel测试，选择五个组合优化领域的未解猜想，向GPT-5提供相关源论文但不透露猜想内容，详细评估模型的推理过程。

Result: GPT-5在三个较简单问题上产生接近正确的解，甚至在一个问题上推翻了原猜想并给出有效解；但在需要跨论文综合的问题上失败，在无验证猜想的难题上算法正确但分析失败。

Conclusion: GPT-5在常规推理方面有显著进步，偶尔展现原创性，但在跨论文综合方面存在明显局限，可能是通过Gödel测试的早期步骤。

Abstract: Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong
results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains
unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more
advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether
a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved
conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures
in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source
papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then
assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5
produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different
approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while
providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required
combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a
validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but
failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected.
Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on
routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations
when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step
toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个HTS编码分类基准，基于美国海关CROSS系统构建，并展示了微调的Atlas模型在10位和6位分类上的显著性能提升，同时成本大幅降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTS编码分类是全球贸易中的关键瓶颈，但机器学习社区对此关注不足。错误分类可能导致货物运输中断，主要邮政运营商因海关文件不完整而暂停对美送货。

Method: 从美国海关CROSS系统构建基准数据集，对领先的LLMs进行评估，并微调Atlas模型（基于LLaMA-3.3-70B）进行HTS编码分类。

Result: 微调的Atlas模型在10位分类上达到40%完全正确率，6位分类达到57.5%正确率，分别比GPT-5-Thinking和Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking提升15和27.5个百分点。Atlas成本约为GPT-5-Thinking的1/5，Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking的1/8，且可自托管保证数据隐私。

Conclusion: Atlas模型为HTS分类设立了强基线，但基准仍具挑战性（10位准确率仅40%）。通过发布数据集和模型，旨在将HTS分类定位为新的社区基准任务，并促进检索、推理和对齐方面的未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate classification of products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) is a critical bottleneck in global trade, yet it has received little
attention from the machine learning community. Misclassification can halt
shipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the
U.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark
for HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online
Search System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned
Atlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit
classifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements
of 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking.
Beyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and
eight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to
guarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While
Atlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with
only 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim
to position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite
future work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有函数调用基准测试（如BFCL、tau^2-Bench、ACEBench）只评估参数正确性，但不测试格式指令遵循能力，这在实际AI代理系统中是一个重要限制。

Method: 基于IFEval方法，在JSON schema描述中直接编码可验证的格式要求，包含750个测试用例，每个用例包含带有格式要求的函数和对应的用户查询，采用全自动算法评估。

Result: 即使是GPT-5和Claude 4.1 Opus等最先进的专有模型也经常无法遵循基本格式规则，揭示了实际代理系统的局限性。

Conclusion: IFEval-FC基准测试揭示了当前大语言模型在格式指令遵循方面的不足，为改进实际AI代理系统的可靠性提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Function calling is a core capability of large language models, essential for
AI agents. Existing benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), tau^2-Bench (arXiv:2506.07982), and ACEBench
(arXiv:2501.12851) evaluate argument correctness but do not test adherence to
format instructions embedded in parameter descriptions, such as enclosing
values in double quotes or using ISO date formats.
  We introduce IFEval-FC, a benchmark inspired by IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中基于视觉记忆的回忆问答任务面临的挑战，包括任务导向记忆创建、时空信息有效利用以及多记忆推理能力。

Method: 提出Pensieve综合管道，包含记忆特定增强、时空感知多信号检索和多记忆问答微调三个核心组件。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，Pensieve相比最先进方法在问答准确率上提升高达14%。

Conclusion: Pensieve管道有效解决了Memory-QA任务的挑战，为基于视觉记忆的问答系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Memory-QA, a novel real-world task that involves answering
recall questions about visual content from previously stored multimodal
memories. This task poses unique challenges, including the creation of
task-oriented memories, the effective utilization of temporal and location
information within memories, and the ability to draw upon multiple memories to
answer a recall question. To address these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive pipeline, Pensieve, integrating memory-specific augmentation,
time- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA
fine-tuning. We created a multimodal benchmark to illustrate various real
challenges in this task, and show the superior performance of Pensieve over
state-of-the-art solutions (up to 14% on QA accuracy).

TL;DR: FERA是一个用于击剑裁判辅助的AI原型系统，通过姿态识别和规则推理来解决击剑裁判中的主观判断、人为错误等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 击剑运动面临裁判主观判断、人为错误、偏见以及实践环境中裁判资源有限等挑战，需要自动化裁判辅助系统。

Method: 系统从视频中提取2D关节位置，进行归一化处理，计算101维运动学特征集，使用Transformer进行多标签动作和剑尖分类，并结合基于规则的推理来确定优先权和得分。

Result: 在有限的手动标注数据下，5折交叉验证的平均宏F1分数达到0.549，优于Temporal Convolutional Network、BiLSTM和普通Transformer等多个基线模型。

Conclusion: 虽然尚未达到部署水平，但结果表明在击剑自动化裁判辅助方面具有前景，并为AI在击剑领域的应用（如教练辅助）开辟了新机会。

Abstract: The sport of fencing, like many other sports, faces challenges in refereeing:
subjective calls, human errors, bias, and limited availability in practice
environments. We present FERA (Fencing Referee Assistant), a prototype AI
referee for foil fencing which integrates pose-based multi-label action
recognition and rule-based reasoning. FERA extracts 2D joint positions from
video, normalizes them, computes a 101-dimensional kinematic feature set, and
applies a Transformer for multi-label move and blade classification. To
determine priority and scoring, FERA applies a distilled language model with
encoded right-of-way rules, producing both a decision and an explanation for
each exchange. With limited hand-labeled data, a 5-fold cross-validation
achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.549, outperforming multiple baselines,
including a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BiLSTM, and a vanilla
Transformer. While not ready for deployment, these results demonstrate a
promising path towards automated referee assistance in foil fencing and new
opportunities for AI applications, such as coaching in the field of fencing.

*Tom Pawelek,Raj Patel,Charlotte Crowell,Noorbakhsh Amiri,Sudip Mittal,Shahram Rahimi,Andy Perkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMZ+是一种基于提示白名单的新型防御机制，通过只允许上下文适当的安全消息与代理式LLM交互，有效防范越狱攻击，同时保证合法业务通信不受干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理式AI相比传统模型具有更高的安全风险，因为它们拥有对数据源和API工具的特权访问权限，且依赖AI的非确定性行为。现有的基于恶意意图检测的防御机制存在局限性，需要更有效的安全防护方案。

Method: 提出LLMZ+方法，采用提示白名单机制而非传统的检测方法。通过利用上下文特异性，确保所有外部用户与LLM之间的交互都符合预定义的使用场景和操作边界。

Result: 实证评估显示LLMZ+对最常见的越狱提示具有强大的抵御能力，同时不干扰合法业务通信。在实验环境中，误报率和漏报率均可降至0。

Conclusion: LLMZ+方法简化了安全框架，增强了长期韧性，减少了维持LLM信息安全所需的资源，为代理式AI提供了有效的安全保障。

Abstract: Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable
target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data
sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical
agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone
(DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI
(only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This
characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational
security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely
on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent,
thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this
paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond
traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting.
Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are
permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of
context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM
conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach
streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and
reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against
the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business
communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly
between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach
using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to
0 in our experimental setting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LLM和外部符号方程求解器的新方法，通过问题分解、方程生成、答案验证和迭代修正来解决数学应用题，在数值和代数问题上达到新的SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在解决数学应用题时存在困难，需要结合推理和数学能力。现有方法通过改进提示词帮助LLM解决复杂问题，但仍有提升空间。

Method: 首先提示LLM从问题分解中创建方程，使用外部符号方程求解器生成答案。然后让LLM第二次求解以估计正确答案，通过比较估计值和生成值进行验证。如果验证失败，采用迭代修正过程。

Result: 在数值和代数数学应用题数据集上取得了新的最先进结果，平均比之前最佳结果提高了近2%。在三角函数问题上也获得了满意结果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM解决数学应用题的能力，并引入了两个新数据集SVAMPClean和Trig300来进一步测试LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including
problem-solving and question-answering. However, LLMs often find Math Word
Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning
and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts
have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study
proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from
a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic
equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained
answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is
instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of
estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is
then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an
iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is
eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on
datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs,
improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In
addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a
task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge. This study also
introduces two new datasets, SVAMPClean and Trig300, to further advance the
testing of LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Method: 开发了基于Mesa的地理空间多智能体模型，整合CLIMADA气候影响评估，引入进化学习机制让企业通过适应度选择和突变演化预算分配、定价、工资和风险适应策略

Result: 使用RCP8.5情景下至2100年的河流洪水预测显示，进化适应使企业能够在数十年气候压力干扰后恢复到基线生产水平；未直接暴露于洪水的企业也面临供应链中断影响，世纪末商品平均价格比基线高5.6%

Conclusion: 该开源框架为金融机构和公司提供了量化直接和级联气候风险的工具，同时评估成本效益最优的适应策略

Abstract: Climate risk assessment requires modelling complex interactions between
spatially heterogeneous hazards and adaptive economic systems. We present a
novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with
evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines Mesa-based
spatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive
learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget
allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection
and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections
under RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to
converge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of
disruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even
agents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply
chain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher
under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline. This open-source framework provides
financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and
cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.

Motivation: 现有图RAG系统忽视了LLM在图构建过程中的高token成本，阻碍了大规模应用，需要开发更经济的解决方案

Method: 受HippoRAG启发，在检索阶段引入个性化PageRank(PPR)算法，显著降低图构建成本

Result: TERAG框架在保持高性能的同时，将输出token使用量大幅降低至传统方法的3%-11%

Conclusion: TERAG证明了构建信息丰富图结构的同时显著降低LLM token成本的可行性，为大规模图RAG应用提供了经济高效的解决方案

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely studied
approach for improving the reasoning, accuracy, and factuality of Large
Language Models. However, many existing graph-based RAG systems overlook the
high cost associated with LLM token usage during graph construction, hindering
large-scale adoption. To address this, we propose TERAG, a simple yet effective
framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost.
Inspired by HippoRAG, we incorporate Personalized PageRank (PPR) during the
retrieval phase, and we achieve at least 80% of the accuracy of widely used
graph-based RAG methods while consuming only 3%-11% of the output tokens.

Conclusion: MLMD和语义保持的概念对于确保ML模型在航空系统中的安全合规性至关重要，为未来的标准化和认证提供了基础。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) may offer new capabilities in airborne systems.
However, as any piece of airborne systems, ML-based systems will be required to
guarantee their safe operation. Thus, their development will have to be
demonstrated to be compliant with the adequate guidance. So far, the European
Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published a concept paper and an
EUROCAE/SAE group is preparing ED-324. Both approaches delineate high-level
objectives to confirm the ML model achieves its intended function and maintains
training performance in the target environment. The paper aims to clarify the
difference between an ML model and its corresponding unambiguous description,
referred to as the Machine Learning Model Description (MLMD). It then refines
the essential notion of semantics preservation to ensure the accurate
replication of the model. We apply our contributions to several industrial use
cases to build and compare several target models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出自主数据代理（DataAgents）的概念，通过集成LLM推理与任务分解、行动推理和工具调用，实现从复杂数据到知识的自动化转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据规模和复杂性的增长，数据准备、转换和分析工作仍然劳动密集、重复且难以扩展。数据与AI之间的对齐至关重要，但现有数据结构往往不适合AI优化利用。

Method: DataAgents通过动态规划工作流、调用强大工具和适应多样化数据任务，能够处理数据收集、集成、预处理、选择、转换、重新加权、增强、重编程、修复和检索等操作。

Result: DataAgents代表了向自主数据到知识系统的范式转变，能够将复杂和非结构化数据转化为连贯且可操作的知识。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁在行动工作流优化、建立开放数据集和基准生态系统、保护隐私、平衡效率与可扩展性以及开发可信赖的DataAgent防护措施方面进行协同努力。

Abstract: As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming,
and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale.
Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment
between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways
that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises:
how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations?
Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task
decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can
autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks,
reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and
execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools,
DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to
diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a
paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are
capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection,
transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and
retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and
unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why
the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a
critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their
architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and
capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance
action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems,
safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy
DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通过扩大模型规模、训练数据和计算能力的方法已接近饱和，人类生成文本资源枯竭，需要新的持续学习机制

Method: 经验扩展框架：捕获原始交互→提炼为紧凑可重用知识→定期优化存储内容以保持相关性和效率

Result: 在模拟真实场景中验证，包括未见相关任务泛化、重复查询和过饱和知识存储，经验扩展提高了准确性、维持性能并保持对新情况的适应能力

Conclusion: 结构化部署后学习能够超越静态人类生成数据的限制，为持续智能进步提供可扩展路径

Abstract: Scaling model size, training data, and compute power have driven advances in
large language models (LLMs), but these approaches are reaching saturation as
human-generated text is exhausted and further gains diminish. We propose
experience scaling, a framework for continuous post-deployment evolution for
LLMs through autonomous interaction with the environment and collaborative
sharing of accumulated experience. The framework captures raw interactions,
distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored
content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in
simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen
but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores.
Across all settings, experience scaling improves accuracy, sustains performance
over time, and maintains gains when applied to novel situations. These results
demonstrate that structured post-deployment learning can extend LLM
capabilities beyond the limits of static human-generated data, offering a
scalable path for continued intelligence progress.

Motivation: 解决异构多代理系统中代理能力发现的可扩展性、可验证性和互操作性问题，为新兴代理模式提供统一的注册和发现机制。

Method: 基于Open Agentic Schema Framework构建，采用两级映射架构（Kademlia DHT），重用OCI/ORAS基础设施进行工件分发，集成Sigstore用于来源验证，支持模式驱动的可扩展性。

Result: 建立了高效的分布式代理目录服务架构，支持跨异构多代理系统的能力发现，具备安全性和性能保障。

Conclusion: ADS为新兴代理注册和互操作性倡议提供了重要的技术基础，解决了多代理系统中的关键发现和验证挑战。

Abstract: The Agent Directory Service (ADS) is a distributed directory for the
discovery of AI agent capabilities, metadata, and provenance. It leverages
content-addressed storage, hierarchical taxonomies, and cryptographic signing
to enable efficient, verifiable, and multi-dimensional discovery across
heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Built on the Open Agentic Schema
Framework (OASF), ADS decouples capability indexing from content location
through a two-level mapping realized over a Kademlia-based Distributed Hash
Table (DHT). It reuses mature OCI / ORAS infrastructure for artifact
distribution, integrates Sigstore for provenance, and supports schema-driven
extensibility for emerging agent modalities (LLM prompt agents, MCP servers,
A2A-enabled components). This paper formalizes the architectural model,
describes storage and discovery layers, explains security and performance
properties, and positions ADS within the broader landscape of emerging agent
registry and interoperability initiatives.

### [156] [Bounded PCTL Model Checking of Large Language Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18836)
*Dennis Gross,Helge Spieker,Arnaud Gotlieb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMCHECKER是一种基于模型检验的方法，用于验证LLM文本生成过程的概率计算树逻辑(PCTL)属性。该方法通过α-k有界文本生成来限制验证范围，只考虑每个生成步骤中前k个token的累积概率超过阈值α的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对LLM文本生成过程的形式化验证手段，无法保证生成文本的一致性和可靠性。作者发现文本生成过程中通常只选择有限数量的token，且这些token并不总是相同，这为形式化验证提供了可能性。

Method: 提出α-k有界文本生成方法：在每个文本生成步骤中，只关注前k个token中累积概率超过阈值α的token。LLMCHECKER基于模型检验技术，考虑初始字符串和后续的top-k token，支持多种文本量化方法（如文本质量和偏见评估）。

Result: 该方法在多个LLM模型（Llama、Gemma、Mistral、Genstruct、BERT）上进行了验证，证明了其适用性。这是首次将PCTL模型检验应用于LLM文本生成过程的一致性检查。

Conclusion: LLMCHECKER为LLM文本生成过程提供了首个基于PCTL的形式化验证框架，能够有效检查生成过程的一致性和可靠性，为LLM的安全性和可信性评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification
method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of
an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number
of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the
same. This insight drives the creation of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded text generation,
narrowing the focus to the $\alpha$ maximal cumulative probability on the
top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification
method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while
accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text
quality and biases. The threshold $\alpha$ further reduces the selected tokens,
only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability.
LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of
$\alpha$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in
several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our
knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to
check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.

Motivation: ICD编码对于临床文档、计费和医疗分析至关重要，但目前仍是劳动密集且易出错的任务。尽管LLM在自动化ICD编码方面有潜力，但在基础模型选择、输入上下文化和训练数据冗余方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用模块化框架，包括LLM-as-judge评估协议与Plackett-Luce聚合来评估和排名开源LLM；引入基于嵌入的相似性度量和冗余感知采样策略；利用台湾医院的结构化出院摘要评估上下文效果。

Result: 在两个机构数据集上的实验表明，经过微调的选择基础模型在内部和外部评估中始终优于基线LLM。包含更多临床部分持续提高预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究使用开源LLM建立了实用且原则性的ICD-10-CM编码预测方法，为自动化医疗编码系统的实际部署提供了可扩展的机构就绪解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is critical
for clinical documentation, billing, and healthcare analytics, yet it remains a
labour-intensive and error-prone task. Although large language models (LLMs)
show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model
selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their
effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification
(ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled
model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design.
The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce
aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic
comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based
similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove
semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge
summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine
section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling
paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the
selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in
internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections
consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs
to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for
real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed
model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.

Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法在优势函数分配上存在优势反转和优势镜像问题，阻碍了不同查询样本间的合理优势分配。

Method: 提出MAPO策略，识别轨迹的不同确定性，为高确定性轨迹样本引入优势百分比偏差，并动态重加权优势函数以适应样本特定特征。

Result: 与相关最先进方法的比较以及对不同优势变体的消融研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPO是一种简单但有效的GRPO策略，能够自适应配置优势函数，提升基础模型在推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the
performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage
function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory
importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion
and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation
across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective
GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the
trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent
deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we
dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory
certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for
sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art
methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates
the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了ProfileBench基准和Conf-Profile框架，通过置信度驱动的两阶段方法解决用户画像中的标签稀缺和噪声问题，显著提升LLM在用户画像任务上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户画像作为用户理解的核心技术，LLMs为此提供了有前景的途径，但缺乏全面基准和面临标签稀缺、数据异构噪声等挑战

Method: 提出Conf-Profile框架：第一阶段利用高级LLM生成高质量标签，通过置信度加权投票和校准；第二阶段通过置信度引导的无监督强化学习增强推理能力

Result: 实验结果表明Conf-Profile通过两阶段训练显著提升性能，在Qwen3-8B模型上F1分数提高了13.97

Conclusion: 该工作为解决标签稀缺和噪声条件下的可靠用户画像提供了有效解决方案，证明了置信度驱动方法的有效性

Abstract: User profiling, as a core technique for user understanding, aims to infer
structural attributes from user information. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by
the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform,
encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy.
However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of
collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy
user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free
and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning
framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize
high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed
by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence
calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results,
rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a
lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided
unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty
filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental
results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through
the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的LLM记忆定义和四部分分类法（参数化、上下文、外部、程序性/情景性），建立了记忆四元组框架，并设计了分层评估协议来标准化LLM记忆研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLM记忆研究中缺乏统一操作定义、评估标准不一致以及治理框架缺失的问题，建立一个可复现、可比较和可治理的坐标系统。

Method: 采用三设置协议（仅参数、离线检索、在线检索）解耦能力与信息可用性，构建分层评估框架，整合时间治理和泄漏审计，并提出DMM Gov更新遗忘协调机制。

Result: 建立了包含参数化记忆、上下文记忆、外部记忆和程序性/情景性记忆的完整评估体系，提供了可测试的命题和治理规范。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM记忆研究提供了标准化的方法论基础，支持可复现的比较和实际部署中的治理需求。

Abstract: Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent
state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be
addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy
(parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple
(location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism,
evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To
avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a
three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval)
that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and
timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book
recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves
and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet
attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency
and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and
leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and
uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with
multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM
Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC),
and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout,
monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict
handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable
propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally
constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with
small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a
reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and
deployment.

Motivation: 开发一个高效的大规模推理模型，解决复杂推理任务中的效率问题，特别是在智能体推理方面减少令牌消耗。

Method: 采用长链思维数据冷启动训练策略，结合领域并行训练方案将不同领域的专家模型融合，使用DORA大规模RL框架实现异步训练加速。

Result: 在AIME-25上平均令牌消耗减少64.5%（从19,653降至6,965），在复杂推理任务上达到开源模型的最先进性能。

Conclusion: LongCat-Flash-Thinking展示了高效推理模型的可行性，为推理系统和智能体AI研究提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter
open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities
are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with
long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale
Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start
training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and
equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning.
Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples
optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and
subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly
Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic
ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL
framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over
synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result,
LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional
efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5%
(from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We
release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems
and agentic AI research.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了视觉语言模型中的视觉空间推理能力，提出了空间智能的三级能力分类，并创建了包含20个开源数据集的空间智能基准测试SIBench。实验发现当前最先进的VLM在基础感知任务上表现良好，但在理解和规划任务中存在明显差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉空间推理是人类核心认知能力，对推进具身智能和自主系统至关重要。尽管视觉语言模型取得进展，但由于三维空间表示和推理的复杂性，实现人类水平的VSR仍然极具挑战。

Method: 1）系统回顾现有方法（输入模态、模型架构、训练策略、推理机制）；2）将空间智能分为基础感知、空间理解、空间规划三个能力层级；3）构建SIBench基准测试，涵盖23个任务设置的近20个开源数据集；4）对最先进VLM进行实验评估。

Result: 实验显示VLM在感知与推理之间存在显著差距：模型在基础感知任务上表现胜任，但在理解和规划任务中持续表现不佳，特别是在数值估计、多视角推理、时间动态和空间想象方面。

Conclusion: 研究强调了实现空间智能仍面临的重大挑战，同时提供了系统路线图和全面基准测试来推动该领域未来研究。

Abstract: Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) is a core human cognitive ability and a
critical requirement for advancing embodied intelligence and autonomous
systems. Despite recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving
human-level VSR remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
representing and reasoning over three-dimensional space. In this paper, we
present a systematic investigation of VSR in VLMs, encompassing a review of
existing methodologies across input modalities, model architectures, training
strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, we categorize spatial
intelligence into three levels of capability, ie, basic perception, spatial
understanding, spatial planning, and curate SIBench, a spatial intelligence
benchmark encompassing nearly 20 open-source datasets across 23 task settings.
Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a pronounced gap between
perception and reasoning, as models show competence in basic perceptual tasks
but consistently underperform in understanding and planning tasks, particularly
in numerical estimation, multi-view reasoning, temporal dynamics, and spatial
imagination. These findings underscore the substantial challenges that remain
in achieving spatial intelligence, while providing both a systematic roadmap
and a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in the field. The

Motivation: 传统微调方法存在灾难性遗忘和数据效率低下的问题，限制了LLM在实际应用中的适用性。

Method: 提出DEAL框架，整合低秩适应(LoRA)和持续微调策略，包含知识保留和自适应参数更新模块。

Result: 在15个不同数据集上的实验表明，DEAL在任务准确性和资源效率方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提升任务性能和资源效率，展示了在LLM中推进持续适应的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the
critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific
tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible.
Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing
models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications.
However, con- ventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting
and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes DEAL, a novel framework that
integrates Low-Rank Adapta- tion (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy.
By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the
framework mitigates the lim- itations of existing FT methods while maintaining
efficiency in privacy-preserving settings. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets
show that DEAL consistently outper- forms baseline methods, yielding
substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in
LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

Abstract: Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like
cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being
deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education,
scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable
potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which
can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the
overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep
understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based
agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of
hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete
workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types
of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct
an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence
of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of
existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and
detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this
survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in
LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and
reliable agent systems.

TL;DR: 研究探索LLM是否能从数学可解释的推荐模型生成有效的用户解释，通过用户研究评估不同解释策略的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI研究多依赖自动评估指标，但无法真实反映用户需求和感知，因此需要采用用户中心的方法来评估解释质量。

Method: 基于约束矩阵分解的可解释推荐模型，通过精心设计的LLM提示将模型结构转换为自然语言解释，并对326名参与者进行多维度质量评估。

Result: 所有解释类型都获得良好评价，不同策略间存在适度统计差异，用户评论提供了定量结果之外的补充见解。

Conclusion: LLM能够从数学可解释模型生成有效的用户解释，用户中心评估方法为可解释AI研究提供了更全面的视角。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective,
user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation
model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types
are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as
observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted
scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural
language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in
explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to
capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a
user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed
the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency,
effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the
recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are
perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying
model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals
that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate
statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore
how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary
insights beyond the quantitative results.

Motivation: 预测性流程监控旨在预测正在进行的流程执行的未来，其中剩余时间预测是常见目标。本研究旨在在实际物流出库流程中比较不同预测方法的性能。

Method: 在航空物流公司的真实出库仓库流程中，使用包含169,523条轨迹的新颖事件日志，比较了四种剩余时间预测方法，包括深度学习模型和浅层方法如传统提升技术。

Result: 深度学习模型达到最高准确率，但浅层方法如传统提升技术能够达到竞争性准确率，且需要显著更少的计算资源。

Conclusion: 虽然深度学习在准确率上表现最佳，但浅层方法在准确率和计算效率之间提供了更好的平衡，对于资源受限的实际应用场景具有重要价值。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring is a sub-domain of process mining which aims to
forecast the future of ongoing process executions. One common prediction target
is the remaining time, meaning the time that will elapse until a process
execution is completed. In this paper, we compare four different remaining time
prediction approaches in a real-life outbound warehouse process of a logistics
company in the aviation business. For this process, the company provided us
with a novel and original event log with 169,523 traces, which we can make
publicly available. Unsurprisingly, we find that deep learning models achieve
the highest accuracy, but shallow methods like conventional boosting techniques
achieve competitive accuracy and require significantly fewer computational
resources.

Abstract: Algorithmic evaluation of procedurally generated content struggles to find
metrics that align with human experience, particularly for composite artefacts.
Automatic decomposition as a possible solution requires concepts that meet a
range of properties. To this end, drawing on Games Studies and Game AI
research, we introduce the nested concepts of \textit{Landmarks},
\textit{Monuments}, and \textit{Beacons}. These concepts are based on the
artefact's perceivability, evocativeness, and Call to Action, all from a
player-centric perspective. These terms are generic to games and usable across
genres. We argue that these entities can be found and evaluated with techniques
currently used in both research and industry, opening a path towards a fully
automated decomposition of PCG, and evaluation of the salient sub-components.
Although the work presented here emphasises mixed-initiative PCG and
compositional PCG, we believe it applies beyond those domains. With this
approach, we intend to create a connection between humanities and technical
game research and allow for better computational PCG evaluation

Motivation: 现有因果表示学习方法通常依赖于外部辅助变量来实现可识别性，但限制了辅助变量的范围。在某些情况下，系统驱动的潜在因子可以从数据中轻松观测或提取，这可能有助于识别。

Method: 引入可观测源作为辅助变量的框架，使用保体积编码器实现潜在变量的子空间变换和置换识别，并提供变量选择方案来选择最大化潜在因子可恢复性的辅助变量。

Result: 实验在合成图和图像数据上验证了框架的有效性，能够识别整个潜在变量，扩展了当前方法的边界。

Conclusion: 该框架通过利用可观测源作为辅助变量，扩展了因果表示学习的识别能力，为实际应用提供了更灵活的方法。

Abstract: Causal representation learning seeks to recover latent factors that generate
observational data through a mixing function. Needing assumptions on latent
structures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works
often build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables.
However, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external
to the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can
be easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating
identification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources
being auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables. Our main
results show that one can identify entire latent variables up to subspace-wise
transformations and permutations using volume-preserving encoders. Moreover,
when multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a
variable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the
latent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on synthetic
graph and image data, thereby extending the boundaries of current approaches.

Motivation: 现有LLM任务规划方法依赖频繁查询进行迭代优化，导致高查询成本且仅基于短期环境反馈，难以实现与长期奖励对齐的规划。

Method: 使用LLM生成多样化高级规划程序来迭代产生和优化候选计划，然后通过训练好的领域自适应批评器评估并选择最符合长期奖励的计划执行。

Result: 在ALFWorld、NetHack和StarCraft II Unit Building三个环境中，CoPiC相比AdaPlanner和Reflexion基线平均提升23.33%成功率，减少91.27%查询成本。

Conclusion: CoPiC通过代码驱动规划和领域自适应批评器的结合，有效解决了LLM任务规划中的查询成本高和长期奖励对齐问题，在多个复杂环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI
agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world
knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and
environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address
this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine
plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query
costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental
feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards.
We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of
relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of
high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate
plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and
selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using
high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as
estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs.
Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC
outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving
an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in
query costs.

Motivation: 现有MAS初始化方法未能充分考虑生成智能体在后续阶段的协作需求，需要更有效的团队组成原则来确保系统效率和效果。

Method: AgentInit包含多轮智能体交互与反思，采用自然语言到格式机制确保一致性，并应用帕累托原则进行平衡团队选择，同时考虑团队多样性和任务相关性。

Conclusion: AgentInit具有良好的可迁移性，关键组件有效性得到验证，证明其作为可靠MAS初始化方法的能力和适应性。

Abstract: Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent
systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's
efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do
not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in
subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we
propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams.
Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between
agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to
Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team
selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to
jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective
and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments
show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization
methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks,
achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6,
respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further
analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the
effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and
adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method. Source code and models

their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has
explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using
alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains
underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense
reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities
coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded
commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate
lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and
demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised
fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12
culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by
10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that
out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or
surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural
commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate
that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising
approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

TL;DR: 使用图像机器学习模型分析Ulam螺旋中不同区域的素数分布规律性，发现在较大整数区域（约5亿附近）比小整数区域（低于2500万）存在更易学习的模式，表明机器学习可作为数论研究的新实验工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 素数分布具有确定性定义却表现出随机过程的统计特性，研究旨在探索机器学习能否作为检测素数模式规律性的新工具，特别是验证数论中关于大数区域素数分布噪声减少的猜想。

Method: 采用图像聚焦的机器学习模型，从Ulam螺旋的不同区域提取数据块进行训练，比较在低整数区域（<25m）和高整数区域（~500m）的分类性能差异。

Result: 在500m区域训练的模型准确率优于25m区域，表明大数区域存在更易学习的秩序；精度和召回率分析显示模型在不同区域采用不同分类策略：低数区域侧重识别素数模式，高数区域侧重排除合数。

Conclusion: 机器学习可成为数论研究的新实验工具，特别适用于研究强素数和弱素数的模式，为密码学应用提供潜在价值，结果支持数论中关于大数区域素数分布规律性增强的猜想。

Abstract: Research on the distribution of prime numbers has revealed a dual character:
deterministic in definition yet exhibiting statistical behavior reminiscent of
random processes. In this paper we show that it is possible to use an
image-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of
prime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we
demonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted
from regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on
blocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This
implies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in
the latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem
to imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in
different regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at
lower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns
with number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we
should see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages
(density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness
regularises after scaling by log x. Taken together, these findings point toward
an interesting possibility: that machine learning can serve as a new
experimental instrument for number theory. Notably, the method shows potential
1 for investigating the patterns in strong and weak primes for cryptographic
purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI时代，数据市场需要可信赖的联邦学习解决方案来促进数据共享，但异构数据源的估值和选择仍是关键挑战。

Method: 提出基于Wasserstein距离的估计器框架，采用分布式方法近似Wasserstein距离而不需要原始数据访问，利用神经缩放定律外推模型性能。

Result: 在标签偏斜、错误标签和无标签等多种场景下的实验表明，该方法能一致识别高性能数据组合。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更可靠的基于联邦学习的模型市场铺平了道路，有效解决了数据异构性和隐私保护的挑战。

Abstract: In the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), marketplaces have become
essential platforms for facilitating the exchange of data products to foster
data sharing. Model transactions provide economic solutions in data
marketplaces that enhance data reusability and ensure the traceability of data
ownership. To establish trustworthy data marketplaces, Federated Learning (FL)
has emerged as a promising paradigm to enable collaborative learning across
siloed datasets while safeguarding data privacy. However, effective data
valuation and selection from heterogeneous sources in the FL setup remain key
challenges. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework centered on a
Wasserstein-based estimator tailored for FL. The estimator not only predicts
model performance across unseen data combinations but also reveals the
compatibility between data heterogeneity and FL aggregation algorithms. To
ensure privacy, we propose a distributed method to approximate Wasserstein
distance without requiring access to raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
model performance can be reliably extrapolated under the neural scaling law,
enabling effective data selection without full-scale training. Extensive
experiments across diverse scenarios, such as label skew, mislabeled, and
unlabeled sources, show that our approach consistently identifies
high-performing data combinations, paving the way for more reliable FL-based
model marketplaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BULL-ODE研究比较了完全学习的神经ODE与物理启发的通用微分方程在牛鞭效应预测中的表现，发现在结构化需求场景下UDE泛化更好，而在极端事件场景下NODE更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究结构约束在库存动力学预测中何时有帮助或有害，特别是在不同需求机制下，为混合建模提供具体指导

Method: 使用单级测试平台，比较完全学习的NODE和保留守恒结构的UDE在三种需求机制（AR(1)、高斯i.i.d.、重尾对数正态）下的表现，通过不同训练数据比例评估多步预测能力

Result: 在结构化需求下，UDE泛化更好（AR(1)下库存RMSE从4.92降至0.26，高斯需求下从5.96降至0.95）；在重尾对数正态冲击下，NODE灵活性更优。训练数据减少时，NODE出现相位漂移，UDE保持稳定但对罕见峰值反应不足

Conclusion: 当噪声为轻尾或时间相关时应强制执行结构约束；当极端事件主导时应放松结构约束。这为科学和工程系统中的混合建模提供了指导原则

Abstract: We study learning of continuous-time inventory dynamics under stochastic
demand and quantify when structure helps or hurts forecasting of the bullwhip
effect. BULL-ODE compares a fully learned Neural ODE (NODE) that models the
entire right-hand side against a physics-informed Universal Differential
Equation (UDE) that preserves conservation and order-up-to structure while
learning a small residual policy term. Classical supply chain models explain
the bullwhip through control/forecasting choices and information sharing, while
recent physics-informed and neural differential equation methods blend domain
constraints with learned components. It is unclear whether structural bias
helps or hinders forecasting under different demand regimes. We address this by
using a single-echelon testbed with three demand regimes - AR(1)
(autocorrelated), i.i.d. Gaussian, and heavy-tailed lognormal. Training is done
on varying fractions of each trajectory, followed by evaluation of multi-step
forecasts for inventory I, order rate O, and demand D. Across the structured
regimes, UDE consistently generalizes better: with 90% of the training horizon,
inventory RMSE drops from 4.92 (NODE) to 0.26 (UDE) under AR(1) and from 5.96
to 0.95 under Gaussian demand. Under heavy-tailed lognormal shocks, the
flexibility of NODE is better. These trends persist as train18 ing data
shrinks, with NODE exhibiting phase drift in extrapolation while UDE remains
stable but underreacts to rare spikes. Our results provide concrete guidance:
enforce structure when noise is light-tailed or temporally correlated; relax
structure when extreme events dominate. Beyond inventory control, the results
offer guidance for hybrid modeling in scientific and engineering systems:
enforce known structure when conservation laws and modest noise dominate, and
relax structure to capture extremes in settings where rare events drive
dynamics.

Method: 使用神经网络代理模型进行基于模型的迁移学习，将在某桥梁上训练的模型适配到具有相似特征的其他桥梁，捕捉共享的损伤机制

Result: 使用两座桥梁的真实数据进行验证，将迁移模型集成到贝叶斯推理框架中，结果显示对损伤位置、严重程度和范围具有高敏感性

Conclusion: 该方法增强了实时监测能力，实现了跨结构知识迁移，促进了智能监测策略和网络层面的韧性提升

Abstract: The growing use of permanent monitoring systems has increased data
availability, offering new opportunities for structural assessment but also
posing scalability challenges, especially across large bridge networks.
Managing multiple structures requires tracking and comparing long-term
behaviour efficiently. To address this, knowledge transfer between similar
structures becomes essential. This study proposes a model-based transfer
learning approach using neural network surrogate models, enabling a model
trained on one bridge to be adapted to another with similar characteristics.
These models capture shared damage mechanisms, supporting a scalable and
generalizable monitoring framework. The method was validated using real data
from two bridges. The transferred model was integrated into a Bayesian
inference framework for continuous damage assessment based on modal features
from monitoring data. Results showed high sensitivity to damage location,
severity, and extent. This approach enhances real-time monitoring and enables
cross-structure knowledge transfer, promoting smart monitoring strategies and
improved resilience at the network level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖预定义的单尺度补丁或缺乏有效的多尺度特征融合机制，无法充分捕捉时间序列中的复杂模式，导致性能受限和泛化能力不足

Method: AdaMixT引入多种补丁，利用通用预训练模型和领域特定模型进行多尺度特征提取，并通过门控网络动态分配不同专家的权重，实现自适应多尺度融合

Result: 在8个广泛使用的基准数据集上的综合实验一致证明了AdaMixT在真实场景中的有效性

Conclusion: AdaMixT通过自适应多尺度专家融合机制，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting involves predicting future values based
on historical observations. However, existing approaches primarily rely on
predefined single-scale patches or lack effective mechanisms for multi-scale
feature fusion. These limitations hinder them from fully capturing the complex
patterns inherent in time series, leading to constrained performance and
insufficient generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture named Adaptive Weighted Mixture of Multi-Scale Expert Transformers
(AdaMixT). Specifically, AdaMixT introduces various patches and leverages both
General Pre-trained Models (GPM) and Domain-specific Models (DSM) for
multi-scale feature extraction. To accommodate the heterogeneity of temporal
features, AdaMixT incorporates a gating network that dynamically allocates
weights among different experts, enabling more accurate predictions through
adaptive multi-scale fusion. Comprehensive experiments on eight widely used
benchmarks, including Weather, Traffic, Electricity, ILI, and four ETT
datasets, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaMixT in real-world
scenarios.

TL;DR: 基于AIS轨迹的轻量级特征可实现海峡中船舶类型的实时分类，随机森林模型在测试集上达到92.15%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确识别船舶类型对安全监管和打击非法、未报告和无管制(IUU)活动至关重要

Method: 使用机器学习管道分析AIS数据，提取31个轨迹级特征（运动学、时空、船舶形状等），采用分组训练/测试分割和5折交叉验证，使用随机森林等树模型

Result: 随机森林模型在5类船舶分类任务中达到92.15%准确率，宏精度94.11%，宏召回率92.51%，宏F1分数93.27%，ROC-AUC最高达0.9897

Conclusion: 仅使用AIS轨迹的轻量级特征即可实现海峡中船舶类型的实时准确分类，桥位比和最大航速是最具区分性的特征

Abstract: Accurate recognition of vessel types from Automatic Identification System
(AIS) tracks is essential for safety oversight and combating illegal,
unreported, and unregulated (IUU) activity. This paper presents a strait-scale,
machine-learning pipeline that classifies moving vessels using only AIS data.
We analyze eight days of historical AIS from the Danish Maritime Authority
covering the Bornholm Strait in the Baltic Sea (January 22-30, 2025). After
forward/backward filling voyage records, removing kinematic and geospatial
outliers, and segmenting per-MMSI tracks while excluding stationary periods
($\ge 1$ h), we derive 31 trajectory-level features spanning kinematics (e.g.,
SOG statistics), temporal, geospatial (Haversine distances, spans), and
ship-shape attributes computed from AIS A/B/C/D reference points (length,
width, aspect ratio, bridge-position ratio). To avoid leakage, we perform
grouped train/test splits by MMSI and use stratified 5-fold cross-validation.
Across five classes (cargo, tanker, passenger, high-speed craft, fishing;
N=1{,}910 trajectories; test=382), tree-based models dominate: a Random Forest
with SMOTE attains 92.15% accuracy (macro-precision 94.11%, macro-recall
92.51%, macro-F1 93.27%) on the held-out test set, while a tuned RF reaches
one-vs-rest ROC-AUC up to 0.9897. Feature-importance analysis highlights the
bridge-position ratio and maximum SOG as the most discriminative signals;
principal errors occur between cargo and tanker, reflecting similar transit
behavior. We demonstrate operational value by backfilling missing ship types on
unseen data and discuss improvements such as DBSCAN based trip segmentation and
gradient-boosted ensembles to handle frequent-stop ferries and further lift
performance. The results show that lightweight features over AIS trajectories
enable real-time vessel type classification in straits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA应用于高维解场时计算开销巨大，需要一种更高效的降维方法来支持神经算子学习。

Method: 研究两种patch-based方法：局部到全局patch PCA和局部到局部patch PCA，并探索重叠patch平滑滤波和CNN精炼两种优化策略。

Result: 基于patch的PCA将端到端流水线处理时间减少3.7-4倍，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为PDE系统中高效的算子学习提供了有前景的技术路径。

Abstract: Neural operator learning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven manner. However,
applying principal component analysis (PCA) to high-dimensional solution fields
incurs significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose a
patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller
patches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the
reduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that
balance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1)
local-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off
between computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the
advantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach,
we explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i)
introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a
two-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our
results demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational
complexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline
processing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore
making it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示学习的OOD检测方法仅依赖softmax概率，忽略了视觉语言模型在数百万样本上学习到的丰富特征嵌入的判别潜力。

Method: 通过将分布内（ID）特征投影到提示向量张成的子空间，同时将ID无关特征投影到正交零空间，提高ID-OOD可分性。设计了端到端学习准则，确保强OOD检测性能和高的ID分类准确率。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合子空间表示学习和提示调优，显著提升了OOD检测性能，充分利用了视觉语言模型的判别潜力。

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world
settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using
only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt
learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking
the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs
trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace
representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD
separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt
vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space.
To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end
learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as
high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase
the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 研究结果为胎儿监测应用中不同AI方法的相对优势提供了关键见解，并为产前护理中未来临床AI发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains through training on massive
datasets. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance in healthcare
applications, yet their potential for electronic fetal monitoring
(EFM)/cardiotocography (CTG) analysis, a critical technology for evaluating
fetal well-being, remains largely underexplored. Antepartum CTG interpretation
presents unique challenges due to the complex nature of fetal heart rate (FHR)
patterns and uterine activity, requiring sophisticated analysis of long
time-series data. The assessment of CTG is heavily based on subjective clinical
interpretation, often leading to variability in diagnostic accuracy and
deviation from timely pregnancy care. This study presents the first
comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art AI approaches for automated
antepartum CTG analysis. We systematically compare time-series FMs and LLMs
against established CTG-specific architectures. Our evaluation encompasses over
500 CTG recordings of varying durations reflecting real-world clinical
recordings, providing robust performance benchmarks across different modelling
paradigms. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior
performance compared to both foundation models and domain-specific approaches,
offering a promising alternative pathway for clinical CTG interpretation. These
findings provide critical insights into the relative strengths of different AI
methodologies for fetal monitoring applications and establish a foundation for
future clinical AI development in prenatal care.

Conclusion: 该方法既具有可扩展性，又能产生结构化的空间相关性，且易于实现，在效率和效果上都表现出色

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Balance Attention block for
spatiotemporal forecasting. To strike a balance between obeying spatial
proximity and capturing global correlation, we partition the spatial graph into
a set of subgraphs and instantiate Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local
spatial correlation within each subgraph; to capture the global spatial
correlation, we further aggregate the nodes to produce subgraph representations
and achieve message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention.
Building on the proposed Spatial Balance Attention block, we develop a
multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively increasing the
subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce
structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. We
evaluate its efficacy and efficiency against the existing models on real-world
spatiotemporal datasets from medium to large sizes. The experimental results
show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 7.7% over the baseline
methods at low running costs.

Motivation: 现有的测试时优化方法（如迭代优化和多步验证）计算成本过高，难以在大规模应用中实用。潜在空间优化方法虽然更直接，但仍需要昂贵的逐查询优化循环。

Conclusion: 研究表明，潜在优化的主要收益可以通过离线方式获得，使得复杂的推理技术能够在生产环境中实际部署。

Abstract: Test-time optimization remains impractical at scale due to prohibitive
inference costs\textemdash techniques like iterative refinement and multi-step
verification can require $10$--$100\times$ more compute per query than standard
decoding. Latent space test-time optimization methods like LatentSeek offer a
more direct approach by steering hidden representations, but still demand
expensive per-query optimization loops with multiple backward passes. We
propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative
optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost
during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from
successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to
calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from
the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and
MATH-$500$ benchmarks, ALS achieves $2$--$5\times$ speedup over iterative
methods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Self-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101\% improvement in
efficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent
optimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning
techniques viable for production deployment. Code is available

Abstract: The paper presents a machine learning approach to design digital interfaces
that can dynamically adapt to different users and usage strategies. The
algorithm uses Bayesian statistics to model users' browsing behavior, focusing
on their habits rather than group preferences. It is distinguished by its
online incremental learning, allowing reliable predictions even with little
data and in the case of a changing environment. This inference method generates
a task model, providing a graphical representation of navigation with the usage
statistics of the current user. The algorithm learns new tasks while preserving
prior knowledge. The theoretical framework is described, and simulations show
the effectiveness of the approach in stationary and non-stationary
environments. In conclusion, this research paves the way for adaptive systems
that improve the user experience by helping them to better navigate and act on
their interface.

*Marcelo Ribeiro,Diogo Costa,Gonçalo Moreira,Sandro Pinto,Tiago Gomes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究将轻量级随机梯度下降（L-SGD）算法扩展到RISC-V架构的微控制器上，通过8位量化版本显著降低了内存使用和训练时间，同时保持了模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代IoT设备缺乏GPU或专用加速器，使得本地训练不可行，通常需要依赖云服务，这引发了隐私问题和连接依赖性。联邦学习需要高效的优化算法，而RISC-V架构目前缺乏对设备上训练的稳健支持。

Method: 将L-SGD算法扩展到RISC-V MCU平台，评估了32位浮点算术的性能影响，并引入了8位量化版本的L-SGD来缓解RISC-V MCU缺乏浮点单元的限制。

Result: 8位量化L-SGD在RISC-V平台上实现了内存使用减少近4倍，训练时间加速2.2倍，且精度损失可忽略不计。在Arm和RISC-V平台上都进行了评估。

Conclusion: 该工作成功地将L-SGD扩展到RISC-V架构，为开源硬件平台上的高效设备上训练提供了可行解决方案，特别适用于资源受限的IoT设备。

Abstract: Modern IoT devices increasingly rely on machine learning solutions to process
data locally. However, the lack of graphics processing units (GPUs) or
dedicated accelerators on most platforms makes on-device training largely
infeasible, often requiring cloud-based services to perform this task. This
procedure often raises privacy-related concerns, and creates dependency on
reliable and always-on connectivity. Federated Learning (FL) is a new trend
that addresses these issues by enabling decentralized and collaborative
training directly on devices, but it requires highly efficient optimization
algorithms. L-SGD, a lightweight variant of stochastic gradient descent, has
enabled neural network training on Arm Cortex-M Microcontroller Units (MCUs).
This work extends L-SGD to RISC-V-based MCUs, an open and emerging architecture
that still lacks robust support for on-device training. L-SGD was evaluated on
both Arm and RISC-V platforms using 32-bit floating-point arithmetic,
highlighting the performance impact of the absence of Floating-Point Units
(FPUs) in RISC-V MCUs. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce an 8-bit
quantized version of L-SGD for RISC-V, which achieves nearly 4x reduction in
memory usage and a 2.2x speedup in training time, with negligible accuracy
degradation.

TL;DR: MOBILERL是一个在线强化学习框架，用于提升移动GUI代理的性能，通过难度自适应算法和奖励调整策略，在AndroidWorld和AndroidLab上取得了最先进的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发有效的移动GUI代理面临任务难度分布不均和大规模环境采样效率低下的挑战，需要新的强化学习框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MOBILERL框架，核心是难度自适应GRPO算法（ADAGRPO），包括难度自适应正向回放、失败课程过滤和最短路径奖励调整策略。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct和GLM-4.1V-9B-Base模型上应用，MOBILERL-9B模型在AndroidWorld上达到75.8%的成功率，在AndroidLab上达到46.8%的成功率。

Conclusion: MOBILERL框架能稳定强化学习训练，提高样本效率，在多样化移动应用和任务中表现出色，已被AutoGLM产品采用并开源。

Abstract: Building general-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) agents has become
increasingly promising with the progress in vision language models. However,
developing effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains
challenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the
inefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic
reinforcement learning framework MOBILERL to enhance GUI agents in mobile
environments. Its core component is the Difficulty-Adaptive GRPO (ADAGRPO)
algorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and
failure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties.
We introduce the shortest path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards
concerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies
jointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong
performance across diverse mobile apps and tasks. We apply MOBILERL to two open
models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Base). The resultant MOBILERL-9B
model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of success rates on both
AndroidWorld (75.8%) and AndroidLab (46.8%). The MOBILERL framework is adopted
in the AutoGLM products, and also open-sourced at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoCoGen是一个基于生成AI和势博弈理论的协同数据生成框架，用于解决跨机构联邦学习中的统计异质性和经济竞争问题，通过优化数据生成策略来最大化社会福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注统计异质性，但忽略了机构间的经济竞争关系。当机构是市场竞争对手时，它们可能因担心效用损失而不愿参与联合训练。统计异质性和竞争关系的综合影响尚未得到充分探索。

Method: CoCoGen框架使用生成AI和势博弈理论来建模和分析异构竞争环境下的协同学习。它将每个训练轮次建模为加权势博弈，并通过学习性能和效用公式来表征竞争和统计异质性，然后推导出最大化社会福利的生成AI数据生成策略。

Result: 在Fashion-MNIST数据集上的实验结果表明，CoCoGen能够有效应对不同异质性和竞争水平对机构行为的影响，并且始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CoCoGen为解决跨机构联邦学习中的统计异质性和经济竞争挑战提供了有效的解决方案，通过生成AI和博弈论方法实现了社会福利的最大化。

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (CFL) enables organizations (e.g., hospitals or
banks) to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while
preserving data privacy by keeping data local. While prior work has primarily
addressed statistical heterogeneity across organizations, a critical challenge
arises from economic competition, where organizations may act as market rivals,
making them hesitant to participate in joint training due to potential utility
loss (i.e., reduced net benefit). Furthermore, the combined effects of
statistical heterogeneity and inter-organizational competition on
organizational behavior and system-wide social welfare remain underexplored. In
this paper, we propose CoCoGen, a coopetitive-compatible data generation
framework, leveraging generative AI (GenAI) and potential game theory to model,
analyze, and optimize collaborative learning under heterogeneous and
competitive settings. Specifically, CoCoGen characterizes competition and
statistical heterogeneity through learning performance and utility-based
formulations and models each training round as a weighted potential game. We
then derive GenAI-based data generation strategies that maximize social
welfare. Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST dataset reveal how varying
heterogeneity and competition levels affect organizational behavior and
demonstrate that CoCoGen consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: This study explores the application of supervised machine learning algorithms
to predict coffee ratings based on a combination of influential textual and
numerical attributes extracted from user reviews. Through careful data
preprocessing including text cleaning, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and

coffee quality assessments. Six models (Decision Tree, KNearest Neighbors,
Multi-layer Perceptron, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost) were trained
and evaluated using optimized hyperparameters. Model performance was assessed
primarily using F1-score, Gmean, and AUC metrics. Results demonstrate that
ensemble methods (Extra Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost), as well as
Multi-layer Perceptron, consistently outperform simpler classifiers (Decision
Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors) in terms of evaluation metrics such as F1
scores, G-mean and AUC. The findings highlight the essence of rigorous feature
selection and hyperparameter tuning in building robust predictive systems for
sensory product evaluation, offering a data driven approach to complement
traditional coffee cupping by expertise of trained professionals.

Motivation: 医疗系统面临有限护理资源高效分配的压力，传统优化和启发式调度方法难以处理动态多约束环境。

Method: 使用近端策略优化（PPO）结合可行性掩码，确保分配符合现实约束，动态适应患者到达和护士可用性变化。

Result: 在真实护士和患者数据的模拟中，NurseSchedRL相比基线启发式和无约束RL方法，实现了更高的调度效率、更好的技能与患者需求匹配以及更低的疲劳度。

Conclusion: 强化学习在复杂高风险医疗人力管理决策支持中具有潜力。

Abstract: Healthcare systems face increasing pressure to allocate limited nursing
resources efficiently while accounting for skill heterogeneity, patient acuity,
staff fatigue, and continuity of care. Traditional optimization and heuristic
scheduling methods struggle to capture these dynamic, multi-constraint
environments. I propose NurseSchedRL, a reinforcement learning framework for
nurse-patient assignment that integrates structured state encoding, constrained
action masking, and attention-based representations of skills, fatigue, and
geographical context. NurseSchedRL uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with
feasibility masks to ensure assignments respect real-world constraints, while
dynamically adapting to patient arrivals and varying nurse availability. In
simulation with realistic nurse and patient data, NurseSchedRL achieves
improved scheduling efficiency, better alignment of skills to patient needs,
and reduced fatigue compared to baseline heuristic and unconstrained RL
approaches. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for
decision support in complex, high-stakes healthcare workforce management.

TL;DR: 本文评估了联邦学习在电动汽车充电站异常检测中的性能，特别是在系统异构性和非IID数据条件下的表现。研究发现FedAvgM在异构环境下优于FedAvg，能够实现隐私保护的鲁棒安全方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车基础设施的快速发展，保护基于物联网的充电站免受网络威胁变得至关重要。集中式入侵检测系统存在隐私问题，而现有的联邦学习评估忽略了系统异构性和非IID数据等实际挑战。

Method: 使用FedAvg和FedAvgM两种优化方法，在系统异构性和数据异构性条件下进行实验，评估联邦学习在电动汽车充电站异常检测中的性能。

Result: 在IID设置下，FedAvg性能优于使用相同神经网络的集中式模型。但在非IID数据和系统异构性条件下性能下降。FedAvgM在异构设置中始终优于FedAvg，表现出更好的收敛性和更高的异常检测精度。

Conclusion: 联邦学习能够处理物联网电动汽车充电站的异构性而不会显著损失性能，FedAvgM是构建鲁棒、隐私保护的电动汽车充电站安全的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized training framework widely used in
IoT ecosystems that preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, making it
ideal for IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems with sensing and communication
like Smart Grids (SGs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), and Electric
Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS). With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle
infrastructure, securing these IoT-based charging stations against cyber
threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a
promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook
practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address
these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of
federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system
and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization
approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID
settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the
same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system
heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous
settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our
results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without
significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust,
privacy-preserving EVCS security.

TL;DR: Safe-SAIL是一个用于解释大语言模型中稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征的框架，旨在提升对安全相关行为的机制理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型安全研究主要关注评估模型输出或特定安全任务，无法应对更广泛、未定义的风险。SAE虽然有助于解释模型行为，但之前的研究未能将特征与细粒度的安全概念关联，无法充分解决安全关键行为。

Method: 提出Safe-SAIL框架，系统性地识别具有最佳概念特定可解释性的SAE，解释安全相关神经元，并引入高效策略来扩展解释过程。

Result: 将发布包含SAE检查点和人类可读神经元解释的全面工具包，支持对安全风险进行实证分析。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解释SAE特征来促进大语言模型安全研究，有助于更深入地理解模型的安全相关行为机制。

Abstract: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world
applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research
focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their
ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)
facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining
single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever,
prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained
safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical
behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu-
lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set
of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors,
yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for
generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of
detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a
framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic
understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE
with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons,
and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process.
We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and
human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of
safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习代理模型在物理可靠性分析中应用广泛，但模型近似误差引入的认知不确定性会与模型输入的偶然不确定性耦合，影响可靠性预测的准确性。

Method: 使用Gauss-Hermite求积方法解耦嵌套不确定性，在偶然不确定性条件下评估条件失效概率（使用一阶和二阶可靠性方法），然后将这些概率在认知不确定性实现上进行积分。

Result: 三个示例表明，该方法在保持计算效率的同时，比忽略模型不确定性的传统方法产生更可信的预测结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理机器学习代理模型中的不确定性耦合问题，为可靠性分析提供更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Machine learning surrogates are increasingly employed to replace expensive
computational models for physics-based reliability analysis. However, their use
introduces epistemic uncertainty from model approximation errors, which couples
with aleatory uncertainty in model inputs, potentially compromising the
accuracy of reliability predictions. This study proposes a Gauss-Hermite
quadrature approach to decouple these nested uncertainties and enable more
accurate reliability analysis. The method evaluates conditional failure
probabilities under aleatory uncertainty using First and Second Order
Reliability Methods and then integrates these probabilities across realizations
of epistemic uncertainty. Three examples demonstrate that the proposed approach
maintains computational efficiency while yielding more trustworthy predictions
than traditional methods that ignore model uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在地铁智能交通系统中，准确的换乘客流预测是优化运营计划和提升运输效率的关键环节，需要进一步发展预测理论来支持智能运营决策。

Abstract: In the metro intelligent transportation system, accurate transfer passenger
flow prediction is a key link in optimizing operation plans and improving
transportation efficiency. To further improve the theory of metro internal
transfer passenger flow prediction and provide more reliable support for
intelligent operation decisions, this paper innovatively proposes a metro
transfer passenger flow prediction model that integrates the Seasonal and Trend
decomposition using Loess (STL) method and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).In
practical application, the model first relies on the deep learning library
Keras to complete the construction and training of the GRU model, laying the
foundation for subsequent prediction; then preprocesses the original metro card
swiping data, uses the graph-based depth-first search algorithm to identify
passengers' travel paths, and further constructs the transfer passenger flow
time series; subsequently adopts the STL time series decomposition algorithm to
decompose the constructed transfer passenger flow time series into trend
component, periodic component and residual component, and uses the 3{\sigma}
principle to eliminate and fill the outliers in the residual component, and
finally completes the transfer passenger flow prediction.Taking the transfer
passenger flow data of a certain metro station as the research sample, the
validity of the model is verified. The results show that compared with Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the combined model of
STL time series decomposition method and Long Short-Term Memory (STL-LSTM), the
STL-GRU combined prediction model significantly improves the prediction
accuracy of transfer passenger flow on weekdays (excluding Fridays), Fridays
and rest days, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the prediction
results reduced by at least 2.3, 1.36 and 6.42 percentage points respectively.

Motivation: 研究机器学习模型（特别是Transformer）在解决物理问题时的内部工作机制，探索其权重矩阵是否与物理问题的数学结构存在直接对应关系。

Method: 分析Transformer模型在解决两个代表性物理应用时的权重矩阵特征，并与物理问题的数学结构进行对比。

Result: 发现权重矩阵具有随机性特征，与物理问题的数学和物理结构没有直接可识别联系；将Transformer操作与路径积分技术类比可以解释权重的随机性，但仍无法解决可解释性问题。

Conclusion: 机器学习和科学方法可能是互补的知识获取路径，但直接的可解释性（网络参数与物理结构的对应关系）可能难以实现；需要警惕缺乏洞察力的知识获取风险。

Abstract: It is shown that the weight matrices of transformer-based machine learning
applications to the solution of two representative physical applications show a
random-like character which bears no directly recognizable link to the physical
and mathematical structure of the physical problem under study. This suggests
that machine learning and the scientific method may represent two distinct and
potentially complementary paths to knowledge, even though a strict notion of
explainability in terms of direct correspondence between network parameters and
physical structures may remain out of reach. It is also observed that drawing a
parallel between transformer operation and (generalized) path-integration
techniques may account for the random-like nature of the weights, but still
does not resolve the tension with explainability. We conclude with some general
comments on the hazards of gleaning knowledge without the benefit of Insight.

Conclusion: MoE-CL在大规模工业部署中具有实用性，能够实现持续适应和稳定迁移，支持自进化学习。

Abstract: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn
continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring
self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However,
existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter
isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks
degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and
weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial
mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual
instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated
LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter
independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable
cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the
shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The
discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned
information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the
shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the
discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing
knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting
self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an
industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for
continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance
review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by
15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale
industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are
critical.

Abstract: This paper investigates the privacy-preserving distributed optimization
problem, aiming to protect agents' private information from potential attackers
during the optimization process. Gradient tracking, an advanced technique for
improving the convergence rate in distributed optimization, has been applied to
most first-order algorithms in recent years. We first reveal the inherent
privacy leakage risk associated with gradient tracking. Building upon this
insight, we propose a weighted gradient tracking distributed privacy-preserving
algorithm, eliminating the privacy leakage risk in gradient tracking using
decaying weight factors. Then, we characterize the convergence of the proposed
algorithm under time-varying heterogeneous step sizes. We prove the proposed
algorithm converges precisely to the optimal solution under mild assumptions.
Finally, numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness through a
classical distributed estimation problem and the distributed training of a
convolutional neural network.

Conclusion: SDGF模型能够有效捕捉多尺度时间序列间的复杂动态相关性，在多元时间序列预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Inter-series correlations are crucial for accurate multivariate time series
forecasting, yet these relationships often exhibit complex dynamics across
different temporal scales. Existing methods are limited in modeling these
multi-scale dependencies and struggle to capture their intricate and evolving
nature. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Static-Dynamic
Graph Fusion network (SDGF), whose core lies in capturing multi-scale
inter-series correlations through a dual-path graph structure learning
approach. Specifically, the model utilizes a static graph based on prior
knowledge to anchor long-term, stable dependencies, while concurrently
employing Multi-level Wavelet Decomposition to extract multi-scale features for
constructing an adaptively learned dynamic graph to capture associations at
different scales. We design an attention-gated module to fuse these two
complementary sources of information intelligently, and a multi-kernel dilated
convolutional network is then used to deepen the understanding of temporal
patterns. Comprehensive experiments on multiple widely used real-world
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains, driving significant technological advancements and innovations.
Despite the rapid growth in model scale and capability, systematic, data-driven
research on how structural configurations affect performance remains scarce. To
address this gap, we present a large-scale dataset encompassing diverse
open-source LLM structures and their performance across multiple benchmarks.
Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a systematic, data mining-driven analysis
to validate and quantify the relationship between structural configurations and
performance. Our study begins with a review of the historical development of
LLMs and an exploration of potential future trends. We then analyze how various
structural choices impact performance across benchmarks and further corroborate
our findings using mechanistic interpretability techniques. By providing
data-driven insights into LLM optimization, our work aims to guide the targeted
development and application of future models. We will release our dataset at

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为LoRALib的统一基准，用于标准化LoRA-MoE方法的评估，通过40个下游任务的数据集和17种模型架构的680个LoRA模块进行大规模实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA-MoE方法在模型、数据集、超参数和评估方法上缺乏统一标准，难以进行公平比较。

Method: 将40个下游任务的数据集标准化为统一格式，使用相同超参数进行微调，获得680个LoRA模块，基于LoRA库对3种代表性LoRA-MoE方法和不同LoRA选择机制进行大规模实验。

Result: 实验表明LoRAMoE表现最佳，优先选择与目标任务相关的LoRA可以进一步提升MoE性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现将为未来工作提供启发，数据集和LoRA库已开源。

Abstract: As a parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) can save significant costs in storage and computing, but its strong
adaptability to a single task is often accompanied by insufficient cross-task
generalization capabilities. To improve this, existing work combines LoRA with
mixture-of-experts (MoE) to enhance the model's adaptability through expert
modules and routing mechanisms. However, existing LoRA-MoE methods lack unified
standards in models, datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation methods, making
it difficult to conduct fair comparisons between different methods. To this
end, we proposed a unified benchmark named LoRALib. Specifically, we
standardized datasets from $40$ downstream tasks into a unified format,
fine-tuned them using the same hyperparameters and obtained $680$ LoRA modules
across $17$ model architectures. Based on this LoRA library, we conduct
large-scale experiments on $3$ representative LoRA-MoE methods and different
LoRA selection mechanisms using the open-sourced testing tool OpenCompass.
Extensive experiments show that LoRAMoE performs best, and that prioritizing
LoRAs relevant to the target task can further improve the performance of MoE.
We hope these findings will inspire future work. Our datasets and LoRA library
are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/YaoLuzjut/LoRAOcean_dataset

Motivation: 解决现有方法在专家身份上操作的问题，开发一个既保持排名忠实性又具有方差自适应性的算法。

Method: 利用排名基准与分布基准的结构等价性，直接在排名诱导的Plackett-Luce参数化中进行更新，确保分布始终属于排名诱导分布类。

Result: RIPLM是第一个在睡眠专家设置中既保持排名忠实性又具有方差自适应性的算法。

Conclusion: RIPLM算法通过创新的参数化方法，成功解决了排名基准与分布基准的等价性问题，为睡眠专家设置提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm, \emph{Rank-Induced Plackett--Luce Mirror
Descent (RIPLM)}, which leverages the structural equivalence between the
\emph{rank benchmark} and the \emph{distributional benchmark} established in
\citet{BergamOzcanHsu2022}. Unlike prior approaches that operate on expert
identities, RIPLM updates directly in the \emph{rank-induced Plackett--Luce
(PL)} parameterization. This ensures that the algorithm's played distributions
remain within the class of rank-induced distributions at every round,
preserving the equivalence with the rank benchmark. To our knowledge, RIPLM is
the first algorithm that is both (i) \emph{rank-faithful} and (ii)
\emph{variance-adaptive} in the sleeping experts setting.

*Akshay Murthy,Shawn Sebastian,Manil Shangle,Huaduo Wang,Sopam Dasgupta,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究比较了规则分类器FOLD-SE与FOLD-R++在二分类任务中的表现，以及FOLD-SE与XGBoost在多分类任务中的性能。结果表明FOLD-SE在保持可解释性的同时，性能接近甚至优于对比算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型需要在准确性、效率和可解释性之间取得平衡。传统模型如神经网络虽然准确率高但缺乏透明度，因此需要开发既能提供可解释规则又保持良好性能的新算法。

Method: 使用分类数据集，以准确率、F1分数和处理时间作为主要性能指标，比较FOLD-SE与FOLD-R++在二分类任务中的表现，以及FOLD-SE与XGBoost在多分类任务中的性能。

Result: FOLD-SE在二分类中比FOLD-R++规则更少，仅损失少量准确性和处理效率；在多分类中比XGBoost更精确高效，同时生成可理解的规则集。

Conclusion: FOLD-SE等基于规则的方法能够在可解释性和性能之间架起桥梁，成为黑盒模型在多样化分类任务中的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Recently, the demand for Machine Learning (ML) models that can balance
accuracy, efficiency, and interpreability has grown significantly.
Traditionally, there has been a tradeoff between accuracy and explainability in
predictive models, with models such as Neural Networks achieving high accuracy
on complex datasets while sacrificing internal transparency. As such, new
rule-based algorithms such as FOLD-SE have been developed that provide tangible
justification for predictions in the form of interpretable rule sets. The
primary objective of this study was to compare FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++, both
rule-based classifiers, in binary classification and evaluate how FOLD-SE
performs against XGBoost, a widely used ensemble classifier, when applied to
multi-category classification. We hypothesized that because FOLD-SE can
generate a condensed rule set in a more explainable manner, it would lose
upwards of an average of 3 percent in accuracy and F1 score when compared with
XGBoost and FOLD-R++ in multiclass and binary classification, respectively. The
research used data collections for classification, with accuracy, F1 scores,
and processing time as the primary performance measures. Outcomes show that
FOLD-SE is superior to FOLD-R++ in terms of binary classification by offering
fewer rules but losing a minor percentage of accuracy and efficiency in
processing time; in tasks that involve multi-category classifications, FOLD-SE
is more precise and far more efficient compared to XGBoost, in addition to
generating a comprehensible rule set. The results point out that FOLD-SE is a
better choice for both binary tasks and classifications with multiple
categories. Therefore, these results demonstrate that rule-based approaches
like FOLD-SE can bridge the gap between explainability and performance,
highlighting their potential as viable alternatives to black-box models in
diverse classification tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个结合机器学习预测建模和基因无关通路映射的新框架，用于识别2型糖尿病高风险个体并发现潜在治疗靶点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代谢疾病特别是2型糖尿病对全球健康造成重大负担，对遗传易感人群如皮马印第安人影响尤为严重，需要开发精准医学解决方案。

Method: 使用皮马印第安人数据集，应用逻辑回归和t检验识别T2DM关键预测因子，开发通路映射策略将预测因子与胰岛素信号、AMPK和PPAR等关键信号网络连接。

Result: 模型整体准确率达到78.43%，通过通路富集分析验证了GLP-1/GIP受体激动剂、AMPK激活剂、SIRT1调节剂和植物化学物等治疗策略。

Conclusion: 该框架通过提供可解释和可扩展的解决方案，推动了代谢疾病早期检测和靶向干预的精准医学发展。

Abstract: Metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), represent
a significant global health burden, disproportionately impacting genetically
predisposed populations such as the Pima Indians (a Native American tribe from
south central Arizona). This study introduces a novel machine learning (ML)
framework that integrates predictive modeling with gene-agnostic pathway
mapping to identify high-risk individuals and uncover potential therapeutic
targets. Using the Pima Indian dataset, logistic regression and t-tests were
applied to identify key predictors of T2DM, yielding an overall model accuracy
of 78.43%. To bridge predictive analytics with biological relevance, we
developed a pathway mapping strategy that links identified predictors to
critical signaling networks, including insulin signaling, AMPK, and PPAR
pathways. This approach provides mechanistic insights without requiring direct
molecular data. Building upon these connections, we propose therapeutic
strategies such as dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, AMPK activators, SIRT1
modulators, and phytochemical, further validated through pathway enrichment
analyses. Overall, this framework advances precision medicine by offering
interpretable and scalable solutions for early detection and targeted
intervention in metabolic disorders. The key contributions of this work are:
(1) development of an ML framework combining logistic regression and principal
component analysis (PCA) for T2DM risk prediction; (2) introduction of a
gene-agnostic pathway mapping approach to generate mechanistic insights; and
(3) identification of novel therapeutic strategies tailored for high-risk
populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Kaplan-Meier图数据提取方法依赖手动数字化，容易出错且缺乏可扩展性，需要自动化解决方案来提高临床研究的效率和准确性。

Method: KM-GPT整合了先进的图像预处理、GPT-5驱动的多模态推理和迭代重建算法，采用混合推理架构自动化地将非结构化信息转换为结构化数据流。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的严格评估显示，KM-GPT始终表现出卓越的准确性，并在胃癌免疫治疗试验的荟萃分析中成功应用。

Conclusion: KM-GPT通过自动化传统手动流程并提供基于Web的解决方案，利用重建的个体患者数据支持更明智的下游分析和循证决策，改变了临床研究方式。

Abstract: Reconstructing individual patient data (IPD) from Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots
provides valuable insights for evidence synthesis in clinical research.
However, existing approaches often rely on manual digitization, which is
error-prone and lacks scalability. To address these limitations, we develop
KM-GPT, the first fully automated, AI-powered pipeline for reconstructing IPD
directly from KM plots with high accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility.
KM-GPT integrates advanced image preprocessing, multi-modal reasoning powered
by GPT-5, and iterative reconstruction algorithms to generate high-quality IPD
without manual input or intervention. Its hybrid reasoning architecture
automates the conversion of unstructured information into structured data flows
and validates data extraction from complex KM plots. To improve accessibility,
KM-GPT is equipped with a user-friendly web interface and an integrated AI
assistant, enabling researchers to reconstruct IPD without requiring
programming expertise. KM-GPT was rigorously evaluated on synthetic and
real-world datasets, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy. To
illustrate its utility, we applied KM-GPT to a meta-analysis of gastric cancer
immunotherapy trials, reconstructing IPD to facilitate evidence synthesis and
biomarker-based subgroup analyses. By automating traditionally manual processes
and providing a scalable, web-based solution, KM-GPT transforms clinical
research by leveraging reconstructed IPD to enable more informed downstream
analyses, supporting evidence-based decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空数据常因传感器故障等原因存在缺失值，现有扩散模型方法在提取时空依赖关系时存在误差累积问题，且忽略了不同噪声水平下依赖关系的变异性。

Method: 提出AdaSTI框架，包含基于双向S4模型的BiS4PI网络进行预插补，STC网络提取条件信息，以及具有门控注意力机制的NAST网络捕获变异性依赖关系。

Conclusion: AdaSTI通过自适应地处理不同扩散步骤中的时空依赖关系，显著提升了时空数据插补的性能。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data abounds in domain like traffic and environmental
monitoring. However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor
malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued
efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently
diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including
spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and
utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in
diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation
in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy
data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive
Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel
spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model.
Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model
for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional
information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We
also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated
attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms
existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation
error.

*Syed Ahmad Chan Bukhari,Amritpal Singh,Shifath Hossain,Iram Wajahat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种多标签分类框架，用于预测ICU患者的护理升级触发因素（CETs），包括呼吸衰竭、血流动力学不稳定、肾功能损害和神经功能恶化。使用MIMIC-IV数据库，基于前24小时数据训练XGBoost模型，在四个CET类别上取得了优于基线模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统早期预警系统（如SOFA或MEWS）局限于单一结果预测，无法捕捉临床恶化的多维度特征。ICU患者常出现复杂、重叠的生理恶化迹象，需要及时升级护理。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据库中85,242例ICU住院数据，基于前24小时的体征聚合值、实验室数据和静态人口统计学特征，训练多标签分类模型预测24-72小时内发生的CETs。CETs通过基于规则的临床标准定义。

Result: XGBoost模型表现最佳，F1分数分别为：呼吸0.66、血流动力学0.72、肾脏0.76、神经系统0.62。特征分析显示呼吸频率、血压和肌酐等临床相关参数是最具影响力的预测因子。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在不依赖复杂时间序列建模或自然语言处理的情况下，实现早期、可解释临床警报的实际潜力。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients often present with complex, overlapping
signs of physiological deterioration that require timely escalation of care.
Traditional early warning systems, such as SOFA or MEWS, are limited by their
focus on single outcomes and fail to capture the multi-dimensional nature of
clinical decline. This study proposes a multi-label classification framework to
predict Care Escalation Triggers (CETs), including respiratory failure,
hemodynamic instability, renal compromise, and neurological deterioration,
using the first 24 hours of ICU data. Using the MIMIC-IV database, CETs are
defined through rule-based criteria applied to data from hours 24 to 72 (for
example, oxygen saturation below 90, mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg,
creatinine increase greater than 0.3 mg/dL, or a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale
score greater than 2). Features are extracted from the first 24 hours and
include vital sign aggregates, laboratory values, and static demographics. We
train and evaluate multiple classification models on a cohort of 85,242 ICU
stays (80 percent training: 68,193; 20 percent testing: 17,049). Evaluation
metrics include per-label precision, recall, F1-score, and Hamming loss.
XGBoost, the best performing model, achieves F1-scores of 0.66 for respiratory,
0.72 for hemodynamic, 0.76 for renal, and 0.62 for neurologic deterioration,
outperforming baseline models. Feature analysis shows that clinically relevant
parameters such as respiratory rate, blood pressure, and creatinine are the
most influential predictors, consistent with the clinical definitions of the
CETs. The proposed framework demonstrates practical potential for early,
interpretable clinical alerts without requiring complex time-series modeling or
natural language processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了单个滤波器的语义角色和概念在层间的动态传播，需要更深入地理解CNN的内部推理逻辑

Method: 提出ConceptFlow框架：1）概念注意力 - 将每个滤波器与相关高级概念关联；2）概念路径 - 通过概念转移矩阵量化概念在滤波器间的传播和转换

Result: 实验结果表明ConceptFlow能够产生语义上有意义的模型推理洞察，验证了概念注意力和概念路径在解释决策行为方面的有效性

Conclusion: 通过建模层次化的概念路径，ConceptFlow为CNN内部逻辑提供了更深入的洞察，支持生成更忠实且与人类对齐的解释

Abstract: Concept-based interpretability for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aims
to align internal model representations with high-level semantic concepts, but
existing approaches largely overlook the semantic roles of individual filters
and the dynamic propagation of concepts across layers. To address these
limitations, we propose ConceptFlow, a concept-based interpretability framework
that simulates the internal "thinking path" of a model by tracing how concepts
emerge and evolve across layers. ConceptFlow comprises two key components: (i)
concept attentions, which associate each filter with relevant high-level
concepts to enable localized semantic interpretation, and (ii) conceptual
pathways, derived from a concept transition matrix that quantifies how concepts
propagate and transform between filters. Together, these components offer a
unified and structured view of internal model reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that ConceptFlow yields semantically meaningful insights into model
reasoning, validating the effectiveness of concept attentions and conceptual
pathways in explaining decision behavior. By modeling hierarchical conceptual
pathways, ConceptFlow provides deeper insight into the internal logic of CNNs
and supports the generation of more faithful and human-aligned explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型训练效率低下，主要由于多模态数据引入的长输入序列和层间计算利用率低

Method: STS框架包含两个关键组件：视觉标记压缩器（减少视觉标记信息负载）和层动态跳过器（在前后向传播中动态跳过语言模型中不必要的层）

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中广泛评估，证明了其有效性和效率

Conclusion: 所提出的稀疏训练方案适用于多种MLLM架构，能够显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance across a variety of domains. However, training MLLMs is often
inefficient due to the significantly longer input sequences introduced by
multimodal data and the low utilization of inter-layer computations. To address
this challenge, we shift the focus to the training process itself and propose a
novel training-efficient framework based on sparse representations, termed the
Sparse Training Scheme (STS). This scheme consists of two key components: the
Visual Token Compressor, which reduces the information load by compressing
visual tokens, and the Layer Dynamic Skipper, which mitigates the computational
overhead by dynamically skipping unnecessary layers in the language model
during both forward and backward passes. Our approach is broadly applicable to
diverse MLLM architectures and has been extensively evaluated on multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: HyperNAS提出了一种新的神经架构搜索预测器范式，通过全局编码方案和共享超网络来增强架构表示学习，在少样本场景下显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的神经架构搜索性能评估耗时严重，现有的神经预测器由于难以捕捉架构间复杂关系而泛化能力较差。

Method: HyperNAS包含全局编码方案和共享超网络两个核心组件，前者捕获宏观结构信息，后者作为辅助任务增强架构间模式探索，并采用动态自适应多任务损失确保训练稳定性。

Result: 在五个代表性搜索空间（包括ViT）上的实验显示，HyperNAS在少样本场景下优势明显，在CIFAR-10上达到97.60% top-1准确率，ImageNet上达到82.4% top-1准确率，且样本使用量减少至少5倍。

Conclusion: HyperNAS通过创新的架构表示学习方法，显著提升了神经架构搜索预测器的性能，特别是在样本稀缺的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Time-intensive performance evaluations significantly impede progress in
Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To address this, neural predictors leverage
surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance
predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor
generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships
among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural
predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS
consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared
hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the
comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves
as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture
patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive
multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front.
Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs,
demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For
instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1
accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least
5.0$\times$ fewer samples.

TL;DR: WLFM是一个用于测井解释的基础模型，通过三阶段训练（标记化、自监督预训练、多任务适应）在1200口井的多曲线测井数据上预训练，在孔隙度估算和岩性分类任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测井解释面临工具响应异质性、噪声信号和有限标签的挑战，需要开发能够处理这些问题的可扩展AI方法。

Method: 三阶段方法：1）将测井数据块标记化为地质标记；2）使用掩码标记建模和地层感知对比学习进行自监督预训练；3）通过少样本微调进行多任务适应。

Result: WLFM在孔隙度估算上达到0.0041 MSE，岩性分类准确率74.13%；微调后进一步提升至0.0038 MSE和78.10%准确率。模型展现出层感知能力，可学习可重用的地质词汇表。

Conclusion: WLFM为地质AI建立了可扩展、可解释和可迁移的骨干网络，为测井、地震和文本数据的多模态集成提供了基础。

Abstract: Well-log interpretation is fundamental for subsurface characterization but
remains challenged by heterogeneous tool responses, noisy signals, and limited
labels. We propose WLFM, a foundation model pretrained on multi-curve logs from
1200 wells, comprising three stages: tokenization of log patches into
geological tokens, self-supervised pretraining with masked-token modeling and
stratigraphy-aware contrastive learning, and multi-task adaptation with
few-shot fine-tuning. WLFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving 0.0041 MSE in porosity estimation and 74.13\% accuracy in lithology
classification, while WLFM-Finetune further improves to 0.0038 MSE and 78.10\%
accuracy. Beyond predictive accuracy, WLFM exhibits emergent layer-awareness,
learns a reusable geological vocabulary, and reconstructs masked curves with
reasonable fidelity, though systematic offsets are observed in shallow and
ultra-deep intervals. Although boundary detection is not explicitly evaluated
here, clustering analyses suggest strong potential for future extension. These
results establish WLFM as a scalable, interpretable, and transferable backbone
for geological AI, with implications for multi-modal integration of logs,
seismic, and textual data.

Motivation: 抗生素耐药性预计到205年每年导致1000万人死亡，迫切需要开发新型抗生素来应对这一全球健康威胁。

Method: 使用64亿参数蛋白质语言模型进行微调，结合近端策略优化和复合奖励函数（包括最小抑菌浓度分类器和可微分理化目标）进行多目标优化。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths
annually by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Here we
present ApexAmphion, a deep-learning framework for de novo design of
antibiotics that couples a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with
reinforcement learning. The model is first fine-tuned on curated peptide data
to capture antimicrobial sequence regularities, then optimised with proximal
policy optimization against a composite reward that combines predictions from a
learned minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classifier with differentiable
physicochemical objectives. In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed
low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit
rate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial
activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules
killed bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. By
unifying generation, scoring and multi-objective optimization with deep
reinforcement learning in a single pipeline, our approach rapidly produces
diverse, potent candidates, offering a scalable route to peptide antibiotics
and a platform for iterative steering toward potency and developability within
hours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的训练和推理效率已成为使其更易获取和扩展的核心瓶颈，需要开发高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用统一的3D-Resampler模型架构实现图像和视频的紧凑编码；使用统一学习范式处理文档知识和文本识别；采用混合强化学习策略提升长短推理能力。

Result: 在OpenCompass评测中超越GPT-4o-latest和Qwen2.5-VL 72B等模型；在VideoMME基准测试中达到30B以下模型的最佳性能，仅需Qwen2.5-VL 7B的46.7%GPU内存和8.7%推理时间。

Conclusion: MiniCPM-V 4.5展示了在保持强性能的同时实现显著效率提升的可行性，为多模态大语言模型的高效发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and
represent the frontier of AI development. However, their training and inference
efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible
and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B
parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We
introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and
training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact
encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document
knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid
reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long
reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation
show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as
GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL
72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency.
For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU
memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出并比较了9种训练方法，用于探索具有参数化线性B样条激活函数的神经网络中的双重优化动态，相比传统ReLU模型，在FNN中实现了高达94%的误差率降低，在CNN中实现了51%的误差率降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的神经网络激活函数（如ReLU、tanh、sigmoid）是静态选择的，通过优化激活函数的形状，可以为神经元分配更优的激活函数，从而训练出更参数高效和准确的模型。

Method: 使用参数化线性B样条激活函数，提出并比较了9种训练方法，探索神经网络中的双重优化动态。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比传统ReLU模型，在FNN中实现了高达94%的误差率降低，在CNN中实现了51%的误差率降低。

Conclusion: 通过优化激活函数形状可以显著提高模型性能，但需要付出额外的开发、训练复杂度以及模型延迟的代价。

Abstract: Activation functions in neural networks are typically selected from a set of
empirically validated, commonly used static functions such as ReLU, tanh, or
sigmoid. However, by optimizing the shapes of a network's activation functions,
we can train models that are more parameter-efficient and accurate by assigning
more optimal activations to the neurons. In this paper, I present and compare 9
training methodologies to explore dual-optimization dynamics in neural networks
with parameterized linear B-spline activation functions. The experiments
realize up to 94% lower end model error rates in FNNs and 51% lower rates in
CNNs compared to traditional ReLU-based models. These gains come at the cost of
additional development and training complexity as well as end model latency.

TL;DR: 本文研究卡车与无人机协同的最后一公里配送问题，提出了一种混合强化学习方法，在N=50的欧几里得实例上实现了比ALNS方法平均2.73%的改进，与神经网络方法性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在明确电池管理约束下的最后一公里配送优化问题，无人机飞行速度为卡车两倍，每次飞行需满足续航预算，交付后需在卡车上充电。

Method: 提出混合强化学习求解器，结合ALNS卡车路线规划（使用2/3-opt和Or-opt优化）和指针/注意力策略来调度无人机飞行任务。策略通过硬可行性掩码解码发射-服务-会合三元组，使用精确时间线模拟器确保发射/回收处理。

Result: 在N=50、E=0.7、R=0.1的欧几里得实例上，平均完工时间为5.203±0.093，优于ALNS的5.349±0.038，与神经网络的5.208±0.124相当。RL调度器在所有实例上都不差于ALNS，在2/3的种子实例上优于或等于神经网络。

Conclusion: 学习到的调度器能够平衡卡车等待时间与无人机飞行时间，最小化总完工时间。方法提供了配置优先的实现，支持复现和显著性测试。

Abstract: We study last-mile delivery with one truck and one drone under explicit
battery management: the drone flies at twice the truck speed; each sortie must
satisfy an endurance budget; after every delivery the drone recharges on the
truck before the next launch. We introduce a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL)
solver that couples an ALNS-based truck tour (with 2/3-opt and Or-opt) with a
small pointer/attention policy that schedules drone sorties. The policy decodes
launch--serve--rendezvous triplets with hard feasibility masks for endurance
and post-delivery recharge; a fast, exact timeline simulator enforces
launch/recovery handling and computes the true makespan used by masked
greedy/beam decoding. On Euclidean instances with $N{=}50$, $E{=}0.7$, and
$R{=}0.1$, the method achieves an average makespan of \textbf{5.203}$\pm$0.093,
versus \textbf{5.349}$\pm$0.038 for ALNS and \textbf{5.208}$\pm$0.124 for NN --
i.e., \textbf{2.73\%} better than ALNS on average and within \textbf{0.10\%} of
NN. Per-seed, the RL scheduler never underperforms ALNS on the same instance
and ties or beats NN on two of three seeds. A decomposition of the makespan
shows the expected truck--wait trade-off across heuristics; the learned
scheduler balances both to minimize the total completion time. We provide a
config-first implementation with plotting and significance-test utilities to
support replication.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在生成能力上有优势，但在学习数值敏感的数学和顺序敏感的逻辑任务时存在挑战，现有训练方法缺乏对数学和逻辑模式的全面理解。

Method: 提出DSFT策略，调整掩码策略和损失函数，引导模型理解数学和逻辑模式，可与预训练、强化学习等方法灵活结合。

Conclusion: 这种掩码方法为未来学习特定模式提供了见解，可轻松高效地与其他训练方法结合，适用于各种扩散大语言模型。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a new architecture
following auto regressive models. Their denoising process offers a powerful
generative advantage, but they present significant challenges in learning and
understanding numerically sensitive mathematical and order-sensitive logical
tasks. Current training methods, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and
reinforcement learning, focus primarily on improving general knowledge
retention and reasoning abilities, but lack a comprehensive understanding of
mathematical and logical patterns. We propose DSFT, a simple yet effective
Diffusion SFT strategy, by adjusting the masking strategy and loss function,
guiding models to understand mathematical and logical patterns. This strategy
can be flexibly combined with pre-training, reinforcement learning, and other
training methods. Validated on models such as LLaDA and Dream series, we prove
that DSFT on small-scale data can achieve improvements of 5-10% and
approximately 2% on mathematical and logical problems, respectively. This
inspiring masking approach offers insights for future learning of specific
patterns, which can be easily and efficiently combined with other training
methods and applied to various dLLMs. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动数据预测方法需要为不同数据类型定制专门模型，增加了大规模异构网络中的复杂性和部署成本，需要设计一个统一的基础模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出MobiGPT基础模型，采用软提示学习方法帮助模型理解不同数据类型的特征，引入时间掩码机制指导模型完成短期预测、长期预测和分布生成三种任务。

Result: 在超过10万个样本的真实数据集上评估，MobiGPT相比现有模型预测准确率分别提升27.37%、20.08%和7.27%，在未见场景中的零样本/少样本性能提升超过21.51%。

Conclusion: MobiGPT作为一个基础模型，在移动数据预测方面表现出强大的泛化能力和迁移能力，能够有效支持多样化的优化场景。

Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile communication technologies, future
mobile networks will offer vast services and resources for commuting,
production, daily life, and entertainment. Accurate and efficient forecasting
of mobile data (e.g., cell traffic, user behavior, channel quality) helps
operators monitor network state changes, orchestrate wireless resources, and
schedule infrastructure and users, thereby improving supply efficiency and
service quality. However, current forecasting paradigms rely on customized
designs with tailored models for exclusive data types. Such approaches increase
complexity and deployment costs under large-scale, heterogeneous networks
involving base stations, users, and channels. In this paper, we design a
foundation model for mobile data forecasting, MobiGPT, with a unified structure
capable of forecasting three data types: base station traffic, user app usage,
and channel quality. We propose a soft-prompt learning method to help the model
understand features of different data types, and introduce a temporal masking
mechanism to guide the model through three forecasting tasks: short-term
prediction, long-term prediction, and distribution generation, supporting
diverse optimization scenarios. Evaluations on real-world datasets with over
100,000 samples show that MobiGPT achieves accurate multi-type forecasting.
Compared to existing models, it improves forecasting accuracy by 27.37%,
20.08%, and 7.27%, reflecting strong generalization. Moreover, MobiGPT exhibits
superior zero/few-shot performance in unseen scenarios, with over 21.51%
improvement, validating its strong transferability as a foundation model.

TL;DR: PiMoE是一种新的训练和推理架构，通过在神经网络中内生集成计算能力来解决LLMs无法进行高精度数值计算的问题。相比多智能体系统，PiMoE在token级别实现计算与推理的交替，显著提升了效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型无法将高精度数值计算作为内在可解释能力集成，而主流多智能体方法存在通信开销大、多模态能力效率低和可扩展性有限的问题。

Method: 提出PiMoE架构，通过分别训练专家模型、文本到计算模块和路由器，在推理时路由器在token级别指导计算和推理，实现单一思维链内的迭代交替。

Result: 在两个推理-计算任务上的评估显示，PiMoE不仅比直接微调LLMs精度更高，而且相比主流多智能体方法在响应延迟、token使用和GPU能耗方面都有显著改善。

Conclusion: PiMoE为下一代科学或工业智能系统提供了高效、可解释和可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Complex systems typically rely on high-precision numerical computation to
support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot yet
incorporate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with
existing architectures. Mainstream multi-agent approaches can leverage external
experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from
inefficient multimodal emergent capability and limited scalability. To this
end, we propose PiMoE (Physically-isolated Mixture of Experts), a training and
inference architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of
the workflow paradigm of tool invocation, PiMoE endogenously integrates
computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training
experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router
directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling
iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiMoE on
two reasoning-computation tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent
system approaches. Results show that the PiMoE architecture achieves not only
higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements
in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with
mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiMoE offers an efficient, interpretable,
and scalable paradigm for next-generation scientific or industrial intelligent
systems.

TL;DR: FedIA框架通过投影优先策略解决联邦图学习中域偏移导致的梯度噪声问题，使用重要性感知的两阶段管道来去噪客户端更新，实现更稳定收敛和更高准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习在域偏移下（如Twitch Gamers和多语言Wikipedia网络）会导致客户端模型表示不兼容，使简单聚合方法不稳定且无效。研究发现主要问题不是权重方案而是噪声梯度信号

Method: 提出FedIA框架，采用投影优先策略：1）服务器端top-ρ掩码保留约5%最信息丰富的坐标；2）轻量级影响正则化动量权重抑制异常客户端。该方法不增加上行流量且服务器内存开销可忽略

Result: 在Twitch Gamers和Wikipedia图上，FedIA相比9个强基线方法实现了更平滑稳定的收敛和更高的最终准确率。收敛分析显示动态投影保持了最优收敛率

Conclusion: FedIA通过重要性感知的投影优先策略有效解决了联邦图学习中的域偏移问题，提供了一种高效且可部署的解决方案

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) under domain skew -- as observed on platforms
such as \emph{Twitch Gamers} and multilingual \emph{Wikipedia} networks --
drives client models toward incompatible representations, rendering naive
aggregation both unstable and ineffective. We find that the culprit is not the
weighting scheme but the \emph{noisy gradient signal}: empirical analysis of
baseline methods suggests that a vast majority of gradient dimensions can be
dominated by domain-specific variance. We therefore shift focus from
"aggregation-first" to a \emph{projection-first} strategy that denoises client
updates \emph{before} they are combined. The proposed FedIA framework realises
this \underline{I}mportance-\underline{A}ware idea through a two-stage,
plug-and-play pipeline: (i) a server-side top-$\rho$ mask keeps only the most
informative about 5% of coordinates, and (ii) a lightweight
influence-regularised momentum weight suppresses outlier clients. FedIA adds
\emph{no extra uplink traffic and only negligible server memory}, making it
readily deployable. On both homogeneous (Twitch Gamers) and heterogeneous
(Wikipedia) graphs, it yields smoother, more stable convergence and higher
final accuracy than nine strong baselines. A convergence sketch further shows
that dynamic projection maintains the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ rate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBVR是一种新颖的大语言模型量化方法，通过高斯分布的位向量表示实现硬件友好的快速推理，在4位量化下比FP16模型快2.21-3.04倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ方法存在局限性：RTN方法无法处理LLM权重的类高斯分布，而基于码本的方法虽然考虑分布但存在内存访问模式问题导致推理速度下降

Method: 提出SBVR方法，将权重值映射到非均匀表示点，其分布遵循LLM权重的实际分布；设计自定义CUDA内核，支持在SBVR格式下直接进行矩阵向量乘法而无需解压缩

Result: 在各种模型上的评估显示，SBVR在困惑度和准确性基准测试中达到最先进性能，在4位量化下比FP16模型快2.21-3.04倍

Conclusion: SBVR方法成功克服了现有量化方法的局限性，实现了既准确又高效的LLM量化，为大规模语言模型的部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous Post-Training
Quantization (PTQ) strategies have been proposed to alleviate deployment
barriers created by their enormous parameter counts. Quantization achieves
compression by limiting the number of representable points in the data.
Therefore, the key to achieving efficient quantization is selecting the optimal
combination of representation points, or codes, for the given data. Existing
PTQ solutions adopt two major approaches to this problem: Round-To-Nearest
(RTN)-based methods and codebook-based methods. RTN-based methods map LLM
weights onto uniformly distributed integer grids, failing to account for the
Gaussian-like weight distribution of LLM weights. Codebook-based methods
mitigate this issue by constructing distribution-aware codebooks; however, they
suffer from random and strided memory access patterns, resulting in degraded
inference speed that is exacerbated by the limited size of GPU L1 cache. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM quantization method, SBVR
(Summation of BitVector Representation), that enables Gaussian-like code
representation in a hardware-friendly manner for fast inference. SBVR maps
weight values to non-uniform representation points whose distribution follows
the actual distribution of LLM weights, enabling more accurate compression.
Additionally, we design a custom CUDA kernel that allows matrix-vector
multiplication directly in the SBVR format without decompression, thereby
enabling high-performance execution of SBVR-compressed models. Our evaluations
of SBVR on various models demonstrate state-of-the-art perplexity and accuracy
benchmark performance while delivering a 2.21x- 3.04x end-to-end
token-generation speedup over naive FP16 models in the 4-bit quantization
regime.

Motivation: 人类能够通过自然语言理解地理空间信息，但大语言模型的地理空间认知能力尚未得到充分探索，现有研究受限于不可量化的指标、有限的数据集和模糊的研究层次。

Method: 创建了包含全球12个大都市36000条路线的大规模评估数据集，开发了PathBuilder工具用于自然语言与导航路径的相互转换，并提出了新的评估框架和指标来评估11个SOTA LLMs的路径反转能力。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLMs在地理空间认知方面的局限性，为未来改进LLMs的空间推理能力提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while
the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by
non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research
hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a
large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises
worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural
language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap
between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new
evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art
(SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs
exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the
starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face
challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for
their incorrect answers. Code\ \&\ Data available here:

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态思维链（MCoT）框架，用于解决对话系统中自我中心到他人中心的空间方向推理问题，在传统中文对话导航任务中取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内或复杂环境中GPS信号弱、缺乏详细地图时，对话代理需要将自我中心表述（如"在我右边"）转换为他人中心方向（东/南/西/北）的挑战。

Method: 提出多模态思维链框架，整合ASR转录语音和地标坐标，通过三步推理过程：提取空间关系、坐标映射到绝对方向、推断用户朝向，并在Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat模型上采用课程学习策略。

Result: MCoT在干净转录文本上达到100%方向准确率，在ASR转录文本上达到98.1%，显著优于单模态和非结构化基线方法，并在噪声对话条件下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结构化MCoT空间推理为可解释且资源高效的具身导航提供了一条可行路径，展示了在多语言和真实世界环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Conversational agents must translate egocentric utterances (e.g., "on my
right") into allocentric orientations (N/E/S/W). This challenge is particularly
critical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and
detailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has
advanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal
spatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational
Orientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese
conversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing
egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed
scenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which
integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a
structured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)
mapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.
A curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on
Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of
resource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%
orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,
substantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover,
MCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including
ASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also
maintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic
variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight
the potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward
interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.

Abstract: Task vectors capture how a model changes during fine-tuning by recording the
difference between pre-trained and task-specific weights. The composition of
task vectors, a key operator in task arithmetic, enables models to integrate
knowledge from multiple tasks without incurring additional inference costs. In
this paper, we propose variational task vector composition, where composition
coefficients are taken as latent variables and estimated in a Bayesian
inference framework. Unlike previous methods that operate at the task level,
our framework focuses on sample-specific composition. Motivated by the
observation of structural redundancy in task vectors, we introduce a
Spike-and-Slab prior that promotes sparsity and preserves only the most
informative components. To further address the high variance and sampling
inefficiency in sparse, high-dimensional spaces, we develop a gated sampling
mechanism that constructs a controllable posterior by filtering the composition
coefficients based on both uncertainty and importance. This yields a more
stable and interpretable variational framework by deterministically selecting
reliable task components, reducing sampling variance while improving
transparency and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets by
selectively leveraging the most reliable and informative components in task
vectors. These findings highlight the practical value of our approach,
establishing a new standard for efficient and effective task vector
composition.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, the sequential

that limits the practical deployment. While Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has
demonstrated remarkable benefits for model training efficiency and performance,
its inherent potential for inference acceleration remains largely unexplored.
This paper introduces FastMTP, a simple yet effective method that improves
multi-step draft quality by aligning MTP training with its inference pattern,
significantly enhancing speculative decoding performance. Our approach
fine-tunes a single MTP head with position-shared weights on self-distilled
data, enabling it to capture dependencies among consecutive future tokens and
maintain high acceptance rates across multiple recursive draft steps. By
integrating language-aware dynamic vocabulary compression into the MTP head, we
further reduce computational overhead in the drafting process. Experimental
results across seven diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FastMTP achieves an
average of 2.03x speedup compared to standard next token prediction with
lossless output quality, outperforming vanilla MTP by 82%. FastMTP requires
only lightweight training and seamlessly integrates with existing inference
frameworks, offering a practical and rapidly deployable solution for
accelerating LLM inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in distributed swarm learning (DSL) offer a promising
paradigm for edge Internet of Things. Such advancements enhance data privacy,
communication efficiency, energy saving, and model scalability. However, the
presence of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data pose
a significant challenge for multi-access edge computing, degrading learning
performance and diverging training behavior of vanilla DSL. Further, there
still lacks theoretical guidance on how data heterogeneity affects model
training accuracy, which requires thorough investigation. To fill the gap, this
paper first study the data heterogeneity by measuring the impact of non-i.i.d.
datasets under the DSL framework. This then motivates a new multi-worker
selection design for DSL, termed M-DSL algorithm, which works effectively with
distributed heterogeneous data. A new non-i.i.d. degree metric is introduced
and defined in this work to formulate the statistical difference among local
datasets, which builds a connection between the measure of data heterogeneity
and the evaluation of DSL performance. In this way, our M-DSL guides effective
selection of multiple works who make prominent contributions for global model
updates. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence behavior of
our M-DSL, followed by extensive experiments on different heterogeneous
datasets and non-i.i.d. data settings. Numerical results verify performance
improvement and network intelligence enhancement provided by our M-DSL beyond
the benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GnnXemplar是一种新颖的图神经网络全局解释方法，通过识别嵌入空间中的代表性节点（范例）并使用自然语言规则解释预测，解决了现有全局解释方法在大型真实世界图上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）的决策过程不透明限制了其可信度和应用。现有的全局解释方法依赖小图中的模体发现，在大型真实世界图中效果不佳，因为子图重复罕见、节点属性高维且预测来自复杂的结构-属性交互。

Method: GnnXemplar受认知科学中的范例理论启发，将范例选择建模为反向k近邻覆盖最大化问题，并提供高效的贪心近似算法。使用大语言模型（LLMs）的自优化提示策略生成可解释的自然语言规则。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，GnnXemplar在保真度、可扩展性和人类可解释性方面显著优于现有方法，60名参与者的用户研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GnnXemplar为GNNs提供了一种可扩展且人类可理解的全局解释框架，解决了现有方法在大型真实世界图中的局限性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification, yet
their opaque decision-making limits trust and adoption. While local
explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation
methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped.
Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach
that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is
rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex
structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global
explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar
identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and
explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their
neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem
over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy
approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt
strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse
benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in
fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study
with 60 participants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GETAD框架，通过整合道路网络拓扑、路段语义和历史出行模式来检测轨迹异常，使用图注意力网络和Transformer解码器，在道路约束环境中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹异常检测方法仅考虑轨迹的有限方面，在欧几里得空间中分析轨迹，忽略了底层移动网络（如道路网络）的约束和连通性信息。

Method: GETAD框架使用图注意力网络学习道路感知嵌入，结合基于图的位置编码，Transformer解码器建模序列运动，多目标损失函数结合自回归预测和监督链接预测。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据集上的实验表明，GETAD相比现有方法取得了持续改进，特别是在检测道路约束环境中的细微异常方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 将图结构和上下文语义整合到轨迹建模中，能够实现更精确和上下文感知的异常检测。

Abstract: Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and
unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent
transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention.
  Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and
its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations,
with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level
abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space,
neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying
movement network, e.g., road or transit networks.
  The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework
tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical
travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network
to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and
transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings
that reflect the spatial layout of the road network.
  A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a
multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised
link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations.
  To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence
Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that
emphasizes high-confidence deviations.
  Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD
achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in
detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results
highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual
semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware
anomaly detection.

Result: 理论分析表明，预训练损失的全局最小值确实能够实现上下文强化学习能力。

Conclusion: 研究为上下文强化学习的有效性提供了初步理论支持，表明预训练算法生成的参数最小值具有上下文学习能力。

Abstract: Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by
updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task.
Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of
new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on
some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making
parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional
input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new
task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context
increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically
called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network
enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the
pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this
paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network
parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL
are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for
this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a
Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers
of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.

optimizers and for identifying potential areas of future development.

Conclusion: 该方法生成了适合深度学习的特征丰富图像，同时通过显式编码保持完整的序列信息，为需要准确性和序列恢复的可解释生物信息学分析开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR)
method, also called Reverse-CGR (R-CGR), for biological sequence analysis that
addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss
of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces
complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with
rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction
from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our
reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains
both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving
competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while
providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates
feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete
sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for
interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery
are essential.

Motivation: 离线强化学习在医疗健康应用中面临奖励函数定义困难、逆强化学习在复杂环境中难以准确推断奖励函数，以及学习策略与观察到的医疗行为难以对齐等挑战。

Method: 提出KANDI方法，利用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的灵活函数逼近能力从低跌倒风险老年人（专家）行为中学习奖励函数，同时在Actor-Critic框架中使用基于扩散的策略进行动作优化。

Conclusion: KANDI为解决医疗健康应用中离线强化学习的关键挑战提供了有效解决方案，在活动促进干预策略方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Utilizing offline reinforcement learning (RL) with real-world clinical data
is getting increasing attention in AI for healthcare. However, implementation
poses significant challenges. Defining direct rewards is difficult, and inverse
RL (IRL) struggles to infer accurate reward functions from expert behavior in
complex environments. Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned
policies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address
challenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older
adults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we
introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function
approximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by
learning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults
(experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework
provide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline
RL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm
clinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study,
emphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to
promote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore
KANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare
applications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion
intervention strategies in healthcare.

Conclusion: MeshODENet为开发数据驱动替代模型提供了一种强大且可推广的方法，可加速复杂结构系统的分析和建模。

Abstract: The simulation of complex physical systems using a discretized mesh is a
cornerstone of applied mechanics, but traditional numerical solvers are often
computationally prohibitive for many-query tasks. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their
standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued
by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce
MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs
with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of
challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional
elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in
long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial
computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful
and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate
the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模系统中集成MCMC预处理器提供了可行路径，展示了AI驱动参数优化的有效性

Abstract: Large, sparse linear systems are pervasive in modern science and engineering,
and Krylov subspace solvers are an established means of solving them. Yet
convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments
usually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix
inversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations,
but its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices;
manual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending
MCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts
preconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition
function then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On
a previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better
preconditioning with 50\% of the search budget of conventional methods,
yielding about a 10\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results
suggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale
systems.

Conclusion: GluMind框架在持续血糖预测任务中表现出色，能够有效整合多模态数据并保持长期学习能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes GluMind, a transformer-based multimodal framework
designed for continual and long-term blood glucose forecasting. GluMind devises
two attention mechanisms, including cross-attention and multi-scale attention,
which operate in parallel and deliver accurate predictive performance.
Cross-attention effectively integrates blood glucose data with other
physiological and behavioral signals such as activity, stress, and heart rate,
addressing challenges associated with varying sampling rates and their adverse
impacts on robust prediction. Moreover, the multi-scale attention mechanism
captures long-range temporal dependencies. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
GluMind incorporates a knowledge retention technique into the transformer-based
forecasting model. The knowledge retention module not only enhances the model's
ability to retain prior knowledge but also boosts its overall forecasting
performance. We evaluate GluMind on the recently released AIREADI dataset,
which contains behavioral and physiological data collected from healthy people,
individuals with prediabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes. We examine the
performance stability and adaptability of GluMind in learning continuously as
new patient cohorts are introduced. Experimental results show that GluMind
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting models, achieving
approximately 15% and 9% improvements in root mean squared error (RMSE) and
mean absolute error (MAE), respectively.

Conclusion: PGPCA将PPCA推广到非线性流形几何，能够执行降维并学习流形周围和流形上的数据分布，对于分析具有噪声且分布在非线性流形周围的高维数据具有重要价值。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science
including neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a
prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic
approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection
between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its
extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in
a Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data
may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than
lying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal
Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction
algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear
manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition
to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be
derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold
and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA
model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data
distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations
and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data
distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data.
Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric
coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally,
PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both
around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for
enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of
high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear
manifold.

Conclusion: 离散时间扩散过程是连续扩散模型的有效替代方案，能够提供相似的语音生成质量，同时具有更好的训练推理效率和一致性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These
models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient
training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising,
which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to
the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions.
Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not
have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and
are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores
some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants.
These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative
Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises.
The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable
subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous
counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.

Motivation: 高维嵌入向量的大尺寸给现代向量搜索技术带来了问题：从内存/存储中检索大向量成本高昂，且其存储占用成本也很高。

Method: 使用新颖的简约且计算高效的非线性构建非均匀向量量化器，这些量化器是为每个索引向量单独学习的。

Conclusion: NVQ在高保真度机制下是一种计算和空间效率都很高的向量压缩技术。

Abstract: Embedding vectors are widely used for representing unstructured data and
searching through it for semantically similar items. However, the large size of
these vectors, due to their high-dimensionality, creates problems for modern
vector search techniques: retrieving large vectors from memory/storage is
expensive and their footprint is costly. In this work, we present NVQ
(non-uniform vector quantization), a new vector compression technique that is
computationally and spatially efficient in the high-fidelity regime. The core
in NVQ is to use novel parsimonious and computationally efficient
nonlinearities for building non-uniform vector quantizers. Critically, these
quantizers are \emph{individually} learned for each indexed vector. Our
experimental results show that NVQ exhibits improved accuracy compared to the
state of the art with a minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a
combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and
training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across
different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these
architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In
this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein
folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein
folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving
triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training
objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs
standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a
generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale
SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein
structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks,
SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble
prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic
reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold
shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware.
SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures
designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future
progress.

*Abhijit Sen,Illya V. Lukin,Kurt Jacobs,Lev Kaplan,Andrii G. Sotnikov,Denys I. Bondar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Kolmogorov Arnold Networks（KANs）和物理信息损失函数的新方法，用于量子动力学预测，相比传统神经网络方法显著减少了训练数据需求并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子系统在高维希尔伯特空间中演化，传统数值方法计算成本高昂。现有神经网络架构需要大量训练数据且存在虚假振荡问题，影响物理可解释性。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov Arnold Networks（KANs）结合物理信息损失函数（强制执行Ehrenfest定理），并引入Chain of KANs架构直接嵌入时间因果关系。

Result: 该方法仅需200个样本（传统Temporal Convolution Networks需要3,700个），即5.4%的数据量，就能达到更优的准确性。

Conclusion: 物理信息KANs相比传统黑盒模型具有明显优势，在保持数学严谨性和物理一致性的同时大幅减少数据需求。

Abstract: The prediction of quantum dynamical responses lies at the heart of modern
physics. Yet, modeling these time-dependent behaviors remains a formidable
challenge because quantum systems evolve in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
often rendering traditional numerical methods computationally prohibitive.
While large language models have achieved remarkable success in sequential
prediction, quantum dynamics presents a fundamentally different challenge:
forecasting the entire temporal evolution of quantum systems rather than merely
the next element in a sequence. Existing neural architectures such as recurrent
and convolutional networks often require vast training datasets and suffer from
spurious oscillations that compromise physical interpretability. In this work,
we introduce a fundamentally new approach: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs)
augmented with physics-informed loss functions that enforce the Ehrenfest
theorems. Our method achieves superior accuracy with significantly less
training data: it requires only 5.4 percent of the samples (200) compared to
Temporal Convolution Networks (3,700). We further introduce the Chain of KANs,
a novel architecture that embeds temporal causality directly into the model
design, making it particularly well-suited for time series modeling. Our
results demonstrate that physics-informed KANs offer a compelling advantage
over conventional black-box models, maintaining both mathematical rigor and
physical consistency while dramatically reducing data requirements.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用混合数据集来增强合成数据集在反洗钱（AML）模型训练中的效用，通过结合公开可用的真实世界特征，既保护隐私又提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反洗钱是金融机构面临的全球性关键问题，但开发自动化AML模型时缺乏训练数据，因为隐私和保密问题限制了真实数据的访问。合成数据虽然能保护隐私，但纯合成数据集训练AML模型存在挑战。

Method: 提出使用混合数据集方法，将合成数据与公开可用、易于获取的真实世界特征相结合，以增强合成数据集的实用性。

Result: 混合数据集不仅能够保护隐私，还能提高模型效用，为金融机构增强AML系统提供了实用途径。

Conclusion: 混合数据集方法是解决AML模型训练数据缺乏问题的有效方案，平衡了隐私保护和模型性能的需求。

Abstract: Money laundering is a critical global issue for financial institutions.
Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN),
can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for
developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy
and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the
statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality
has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely
synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes
the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by
incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features.
These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but
also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial
institutions to enhance AML systems.

### [241] [APRIL: Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning to tame long-tail generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18521)
*Yuzhen Zhou,Jiajun Li,Yusheng Su,Gowtham Ramesh,Zilin Zhu,Xiang Long,Chenyang Zhao,Jin Pan,Xiaodong Yu,Ze Wang,Kangrui Du,Jialian Wu,Ximeng Sun,Jiang Liu,Qiaolin Yu,Hao Chen,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APRIL是一种新的强化学习训练方法，通过主动部分rollout策略解决RL训练中长尾响应分布导致的GPU利用率低下问题，显著提升训练效率和最终性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL训练中，rollout生成占用了90%以上的计算时间，且由于响应长度的长尾分布，少数长响应会阻塞整个批次，导致GPU空闲和利用率低下。随着模型和rollout规模的增大，这一瓶颈问题日益严重。

Method: APRIL在rollout阶段过度配置rollout请求，一旦达到目标响应数量就终止，并将未完成的响应回收用于后续步骤的继续生成。这种策略确保没有rollout被丢弃，同时大幅减少GPU空闲时间。

Result: 实验表明，APRIL在常用RL算法（GRPO、DAPO、GSPO）上最多提升44%的rollout吞吐量，加速收敛速度，并在各项任务中达到最多8%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: APRIL将系统级和算法级考虑统一起来，提高了RL训练效率，且与框架和硬件无关，已在slime RL框架中集成，可部署在NVIDIA和AMD GPU上。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale
pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o
series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale
RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the
community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most
of these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation
and training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains
computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%
of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the
long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy
responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model
and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits
scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in
Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the
rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the
target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for
continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are
discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that
APRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL
algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8%
higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and
hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and
deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies
system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of
advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL
systems.

### [242] [Reverse-Complement Consistency for DNA Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18529)
*Mingqian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为反向互补一致性正则化（RCCR）的方法，通过在微调过程中直接惩罚DNA序列与其反向互补序列预测之间的差异，来提高DNA语言模型对反向互补对称性的捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA序列的反向互补序列通常具有相同的生物学意义，但现有的DNA语言模型往往无法捕捉这种对称性，导致对序列及其反向互补序列的预测不一致，降低了模型的可靠性。

Method: RCCR是一种模型无关的微调目标函数，通过正则化项来减小模型对原始序列和其反向互补序列预测之间的差异。该方法在三个不同的骨干网络（Nucleotide Transformer、HyenaDNA、DNABERT-2）上进行了评估，涵盖了序列分类、标量回归和轮廓预测等多种基因组任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，RCCR显著提高了模型的RC鲁棒性，大幅减少了预测翻转和错误，同时在任务准确率上保持或优于基线方法（如RC数据增强和测试时平均）。

Conclusion: 通过将关键的生物学先验直接整合到学习过程中，RCCR为多样化的生物学任务提供了一种单一、内在鲁棒且计算高效的模型微调方案。

Abstract: A fundamental property of DNA is that the reverse complement (RC) of a
sequence often carries identical biological meaning. However, state-of-the-art
DNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing
inconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which
undermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement
Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning
objective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction
on a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate
RCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA,
DNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification,
scalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR
substantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips
and errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to
baselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating
a key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a
single, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning
recipe for diverse biology tasks.

### [243] [Symphony-MoE: Harmonizing Disparate Pre-trained Models into a Coherent Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18542)
*Qi Wang,Hanyang Peng,Yue Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symphony-MoE是一个两阶段框架，通过融合多个预训练模型的专家来构建强大的MoE模型，解决了传统方法专家多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型通过复制单个预训练密集模型的FFN层来构建专家，限制了专家多样性。本文旨在利用多个不同预训练模型的专家来增强MoE模型的性能。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）无训练阶段：通过层感知融合策略构建共享骨干网络，并使用基于激活的函数对齐缓解参数不对齐；2）轻量级路由器训练阶段协调整个架构。

Result: 实验表明该方法成功整合了异构源专家，在多领域任务和分布外泛化方面显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: Symphony-MoE框架有效解决了多源预训练模型专家融合的挑战，构建了性能优越的MoE模型。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable performance by activating
large parameter sets sparsely, minimizing computational overhead. To circumvent
the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs
upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its
feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert
diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This
paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using
experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained
models (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact
that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter
space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To
overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to
harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we
establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared
backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter
misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment.
Subsequently, a single lightweight stage of router training coordinates the
entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully
integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that
significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution
generalization.

TL;DR: 本文从理论上解释了SigLIP和SigLIP2模型中可训练逆温度和偏置参数在sigmoid损失函数下的优势，提出了(m, b_rel)-Constellations这一新的组合对象，并基于此理论分析了SigLIP的成功原因、模态间隙现象以及高质量表示所需的维度条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CLIP和ALIGN等对比预训练方法的普及，理解其表示获取和对齐的元任务变得日益重要。本文旨在从理论上解释SigLIP模型中同步可训练逆温度和偏置参数的优势。

Method: 提出了(m, b_rel)-Constellations这一新的组合对象，该对象与球面编码相关，由边距m和相对偏置b_rel参数化。通过理论分析表征了星座结构，并提出了具有显式相对偏置的sigmoid损失重参数化方法。

Result: 理论分析解释了SigLIP在检索任务上的成功，说明了SigLIP中存在的模态间隙现象，并确定了产生高质量表示所需的必要维度。在合成数据实验中，提出的重参数化方法改善了训练动态。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析(m, b_rel)-Constellations，为SigLIP模型的有效性提供了理论依据，并提出了改进的训练策略，有助于更好地理解对比预训练中的表示对齐机制。

Abstract: The meta-task of obtaining and aligning representations through contrastive
pretraining is steadily gaining importance since its introduction in CLIP and
ALIGN. In this paper we theoretically explain the advantages of synchronizing
with trainable inverse temperature and bias under the sigmoid loss, as
implemented in the recent SigLIP and SigLIP2 models of Google DeepMind.
Temperature and bias can drive the loss function to zero for a rich class of
configurations that we call $(\mathsf{m},
\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations. $(\mathsf{m},
\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations are a novel combinatorial object
related to spherical codes and are parametrized by a margin $\mathsf{m}$ and
relative bias $\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}}$. We use our characterization of
constellations to theoretically justify the success of SigLIP on retrieval, to
explain the modality gap present in SigLIP, and to identify the necessary
dimension for producing high-quality representations. Finally, we propose a
reparameterization of the sigmoid loss with explicit relative bias, which
improves training dynamics in experiments with synthetic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症具有临床和生物学异质性，使得诊断和亚型区分极具挑战性。虽然图神经网络在脑连接建模方面显示出潜力，但其有限的鲁棒性、数据稀缺性和缺乏可解释性限制了临床采用。XGNNs通过结合图学习和可解释性来解决这些障碍。

Abstract: Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multiple
etiologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal
dementia, and vascular dementia. Its clinical and biological heterogeneity
makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain
connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of
interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks
(XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based
learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant
biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent
insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review
dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and
multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for
dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models
in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited
generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open
problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically
meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT)框架，通过多尺度交互拓扑结构来预测多孔材料的吸附、传输和稳定性性能，实现了数据高效和可迁移的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多孔材料具有复杂的多尺度结构-性能关系，现有建模方法难以捕捉局部化学环境和全局孔网络拓扑的协同作用，且标记数据稀疏分布不均，限制了跨材料家族的泛化能力。

Method: 开发了Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT)框架，利用新颖的交互拓扑结构在多尺度（结构、元素、原子、成对元素组织）上捕捉材料信息，通过Transformer架构进行跨尺度联合推理，采用两阶段训练策略（60万无标签结构的自监督预训练+监督微调）。

Result: ITT在吸附、传输和稳定性性能预测方面达到了最先进的准确性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构和化学多样性多孔材料的学习引导发现提供了原则性和可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Porous materials exhibit vast structural diversity and support critical
applications in gas storage, separations, and catalysis. However, predictive
modeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property
relationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical
environments and global pore-network topology. These complexities, combined
with sparse and unevenly distributed labeled data, hinder generalization across
material families. We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a
unified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to
capture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels,
including structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization.
ITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and
relational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them
through a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning
across scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised
pretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised
fine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable
predictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties. This framework
provides a principled and scalable path for learning-guided discovery in
structurally and chemically diverse porous materials.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DS-Diffusion模型，解决了现有时间序列生成扩散模型需要重新训练引入条件指导、生成数据与真实数据存在分布偏差以及推理过程不可解释的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在时间序列生成中存在三个主要问题：需要重新训练整个框架来引入特定条件指导；生成数据与真实数据存在分布偏差；扩散模型和潜在空间的复杂性导致推理过程不可解释。

Method: 提出了数据风格引导的扩散模型（DS-Diffusion），包括基于风格引导核的扩散框架以避免特定条件的重新训练，以及基于时间信息的分层去噪机制（THD）来减少分布偏差。

Result: 实验结果显示，与最先进的ImagenTime模型相比，预测分数和判别分数分别降低了5.56%和61.55%，生成数据与真实数据的分布偏差进一步减小，推理过程更加可解释。

Conclusion: DS-Diffusion模型不仅提高了时间序列生成的质量和可解释性，还通过消除重新训练需求增强了模型对特定条件的灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation
tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require
retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance.
There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated
data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream
tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces
leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we
propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the
DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed
to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based
hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the
distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore,
the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they
originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets
to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the
state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the
discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The
distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further
reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by
eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and
adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.

Conclusion: REBACT方法通过少量修改步骤就能显著提升性能，证明了其计算效率和实用性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interactive decision-making tasks, but existing methods often struggle with
error accumulation and lack robust self-correction mechanisms. We introduce
"Reflect before Act" (REBACT), a novel approach that enhances LLM-based
decision-making by introducing a critical reflect step prior to taking the next
action. This approach allows for immediate error correction, ensuring smooth
action path and adaptibity to environment feedback. We evaluate REBACT on three
diverse interactive environments: ALFWorld, WebShop, and TextCraft. Our results
demonstrate that REBACT significantly outperforms strong baselines, improving
success rates by up to 24% on WebShop (achieving 61%), 6.72% on ALFWorld
(achieving 98.51%), and 0.5% on TextCraft (achieving 99.5%) using
Claude3.5-sonnet as the underlying LLM. Further analysis reveals that REBACT's
performance improvements are achieved with only a few modification steps,
demonstrating its computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数PDE基础模型依赖于确定性Transformer架构，缺乏生成灵活性，无法满足许多科学和工程应用的需求。

Method: 提出了Flow Marching算法、Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) 和Flow Marching Transformer (FMT)，结合扩散强迫方案和潜在时间金字塔，实现了比完整视频扩散模型高达15倍的计算效率。

Result: 在12个不同PDE家族的约250万条轨迹上进行了训练，在未见过的Kolmogorov湍流上进行少样本适应评估，展示了长期滚动稳定性优于确定性对应模型，并呈现了不确定性分层的集成结果。

Conclusion: 生成式PDE基础模型对于现实世界应用具有重要意义，该工作为物理动力系统的建模提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale collections of PDE-governed spatiotemporal
trajectories has recently shown promise for building generalizable models of
dynamical systems. Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on
deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for
many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an
algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by
an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a
generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise
level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a
unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean
successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling uncertainty-aware
ensemble generations. Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a
Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states
into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT)
that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids,
achieving up to 15x greater computational efficiency than full-length video
diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially
reduced cost. We curate a corpus of ~2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE
families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream
evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot
adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic
counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting
the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.

TL;DR: HyperAdapt是一种参数高效微调方法，通过行列缩放对角矩阵实现高秩更新，仅需n+m个可训练参数即可达到或接近全参数微调的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在多样化任务上表现出色，但适应专业应用通常需要微调，这种方法内存和计算成本高。参数高效微调方法通过仅更新小部分权重来缓解这个问题

Method: HyperAdapt通过对预训练权重矩阵应用行列缩放对角矩阵来适应模型，仅需n+m个可训练参数（对于n×m矩阵），同时诱导高秩更新

Result: 在GLUE、算术推理和常识推理基准测试中，使用高达140亿参数的模型进行实验，HyperAdapt匹配或接近全参数微调和最先进PEFT方法的性能，同时使用数量级更少的可训练参数

Conclusion: HyperAdapt是一种高效的参数微调方法，理论分析确立了其更新秩的上界，实证表明它在模型各层持续诱导高秩变换，显著优于LoRA等现有方法

Abstract: Foundation models excel across diverse tasks, but adapting them to
specialized applications often requires fine-tuning, an approach that is memory
and compute-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate
this by updating only a small subset of weights. In this paper, we introduce
HyperAdapt, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that significantly reduces
the number of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods like
LoRA. Specifically, HyperAdapt adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by applying
row- and column-wise scaling through diagonal matrices, thereby inducing a
high-rank update while requiring only $n+m$ trainable parameters for an $n
\times m$ matrix. Theoretically, we establish an upper bound on the rank of
HyperAdapt's updates, and empirically, we confirm that it consistently induces
high-rank transformations across model layers. Experiments on GLUE, arithmetic
reasoning, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks with models up to 14B
parameters demonstrate that HyperAdapt matches or nearly matches the
performance of full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art PEFT methods while using
orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: 该框架在处理具有超越单个数据向量结构的高维应用方面展现出巨大潜力，特别是在噪声和干扰严重的挑战性场景中。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices
based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of
Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume
vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix
and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish
conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation
Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general
setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a
third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint
estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide
the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable
optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world
hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and
interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These
results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging
high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data
vectors.

Abstract: This research focuses on rational pesticide design, using graph machine
learning to accelerate the development of safer, eco-friendly agrochemicals,
inspired by in silico methods in drug discovery. With an emphasis on
ecotoxicology, the initial contributions include the creation of ApisTox, the
largest curated dataset on pesticide toxicity to honey bees. We conducted a
broad evaluation of machine learning (ML) models for molecular graph
classification, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, GNNs, and
pretrained transformers. The results show that methods successful in medicinal
chemistry often fail to generalize to agrochemicals, underscoring the need for
domain-specific models and benchmarks. Future work will focus on developing a
comprehensive benchmarking suite and designing ML models tailored to the unique
challenges of pesticide discovery.

### [253] [A Generalized Bisimulation Metric of State Similarity between Markov Decision Processes: From Theoretical Propositions to Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18714)
*Zhenyu Tao,Wei Xu,Xiaohu You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了广义双模拟度量（GBSM），用于计算不同马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）之间的状态相似性，解决了传统双模拟度量在多MDP场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统双模拟度量（BSM）在单个MDP内有效，但在多MDP场景（如策略迁移）中应用受限，且缺乏严格的数学性质分析。

Method: 通过形式化定义GBSM，并严格证明其三个基本性质：对称性、跨MDP三角不等式和相同状态空间上的距离界限。

Result: GBSM在策略迁移、状态聚合和采样估计等方面获得了比标准BSM更严格的理论界限，并提供了闭式样本复杂度。

Conclusion: GBSM为多MDP场景提供了理论基础，数值结果验证了其有效性，推动了双模拟度量在强化学习中的进一步应用。

Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state
similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states
closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been
successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state
representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP
scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has
attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis
of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In
this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM)
between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental
properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance
bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically
analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in
MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived
from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample
complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on
BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to e-commerce payment fraud detection by
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). By
framing transaction risk as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP), RL
optimizes risk detection across multiple payment stages. Crafting effective
reward functions, essential for RL model success, typically requires
significant human expertise due to the complexity and variability in design.
LLMs, with their advanced reasoning and coding capabilities, are well-suited to
refine these functions, offering improvements over traditional methods. Our
approach leverages LLMs to iteratively enhance reward functions, achieving
better fraud detection accuracy and demonstrating zero-shot capability.
Experiments with real-world data confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and
resilience of our LLM-enhanced RL framework through long-term evaluations,
underscoring the potential of LLMs in advancing industrial RL applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的周期性CNN架构，该架构在卷积层中融入了周期性边界条件。主要理论贡献是证明了周期性CNN能够逼近d维输入空间中依赖d-1个线性变量的脊函数，而这种逼近在低维脊设置（d-2或更少变量）中是不可能的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展CNN近似理论的数学基础，并探索在具有高内在维度脊状结构数据问题中表现优异的架构，如图像分析、物理信息学习和材料科学等领域。

Method: 设计周期性CNN架构，在卷积层中引入周期性边界条件，并通过严格的数学定理分析其表达能力。

Result: 证明了周期性CNN能够精确逼近高维脊函数，建立了周期性CNN表达能力的尖锐特征描述。

Conclusion: 周期性CNN不仅扩展了CNN近似理论的数学基础，还展示了一类具有惊人且实际相关近似能力的架构，特别适用于具有脊状结构的高维数据问题。

Abstract: We introduce a novel convolutional neural network architecture, termed the
\emph{periodic CNN}, which incorporates periodic boundary conditions into the
convolutional layers. Our main theoretical contribution is a rigorous
approximation theorem: periodic CNNs can approximate ridge functions depending
on $d-1$ linear variables in a $d$-dimensional input space, while such
approximation is impossible in lower-dimensional ridge settings ($d-2$ or fewer
variables). This result establishes a sharp characterization of the expressive
power of periodic CNNs. Beyond the theory, our findings suggest that periodic
CNNs are particularly well-suited for problems where data naturally admits a
ridge-like structure of high intrinsic dimension, such as image analysis on
wrapped domains, physics-informed learning, and materials science. The work
thus both expands the mathematical foundation of CNN approximation theory and
highlights a class of architectures with surprising and practically relevant
approximation capabilities.

*Samuel Yoon,Jongwon Kim,Juyoung Ha,Young Myoung Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOMEMTO是一个基于时间序列基础模型的时间序列异常检测方法，通过引入基于patch的内存模块来缓解模型过度泛化问题，能够在多个数据集上联合微调并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于重构的深度模型在时间序列异常检测中容易过度泛化，准确重构未见过的异常样本。虽然已有工作尝试通过内存架构存储正常模式原型来缓解此问题，但这些方法训练成本高且未能有效与时间序列基础模型集成。

Method: 提出MOMEMTO方法，包含基于patch的内存模块：1）从预训练编码器初始化内存项；2）将内存项组织为patch级单元；3）通过注意力机制更新内存项；4）采用多领域训练策略使单个模型能在多个数据集上联合微调。

Result: 在23个单变量基准数据集上的实验表明，MOMEMTO作为单个模型在AUC和VUS指标上优于基线方法，并显著提升了其骨干时间序列基础模型的性能，特别是在少样本学习场景下。

Conclusion: MOMEMTO通过引入patch级内存模块有效缓解了时间序列异常检测中的过度泛化问题，实现了多数据集联合训练，并在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time
series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability
increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen
anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by
incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns.
Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to
be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection,
enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The
memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from
multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across
multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes
memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes
them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We
evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on
AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the
performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.

Motivation: 深入研究对角线性网络的训练动态，揭示其与LASSO正则化路径的精确关系，为理解神经网络隐式正则化提供理论依据。

Method: 通过理论分析和数值模拟，研究对角线性网络从小初始化开始的训练轨迹，并与LASSO正则化路径进行比较。

Result: 在LASSO路径单调性假设下，两者关系是精确的；一般情况下，存在近似联系。训练时间可视为逆正则化参数。

Conclusion: 对角线性网络的训练轨迹与LASSO正则化路径密切相关，这一发现深化了对神经网络隐式正则化机制的理解。

Abstract: Diagonal linear networks are neural networks with linear activation and
diagonal weight matrices. Their theoretical interest is that their implicit
regularization can be rigorously analyzed: from a small initialization, the
training of diagonal linear networks converges to the linear predictor with
minimal 1-norm among minimizers of the training loss. In this paper, we deepen
this analysis showing that the full training trajectory of diagonal linear
networks is closely related to the lasso regularization path. In this
connection, the training time plays the role of an inverse regularization
parameter. Both rigorous results and simulations are provided to illustrate
this conclusion. Under a monotonicity assumption on the lasso regularization
path, the connection is exact while in the general case, we show an approximate
connection.

Abstract: Deep neural networks has been increasingly applied in fault diagnostics,
where it uses historical data
  to capture systems behavior, bypassing the need for high-fidelity physical
models.
  However, despite their competence in prediction tasks, these models often
struggle with

  important in consistency-based diagnosis where decision logic is highly
sensitive to false alarms.
  To address this challenge, this work presents a diagnostic framework that
uses
  ensemble probabilistic machine learning to
  improve diagnostic characteristics of data driven consistency based diagnosis
  by quantifying and automating the prediction uncertainty.
  The proposed method is evaluated across several case studies using both
ablation

assimilation algorithms, and does not require any further training. As a
guiding example throughout this work, we illustrate our methodology on GenCast,
a diffusion-based model that generates global ensemble weather forecasts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的低秩双随机聚类方法（LoRD），通过减少对正交约束的松弛来改进现有图聚类方法，并引入块对角正则化（B-LoRD）进一步提升聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图聚类方法（如谱聚类、对称非负矩阵分解等）过度松弛了低秩、非负、双随机和正交约束，这可能限制了它们的聚类效果。

Method: 提出LoRD模型，仅松弛正交约束以获得概率聚类结果；引入块对角正则化（B-LoRD）通过Frobenius范数最大化增强聚类性能；将非凸双随机约束转化为线性凸约束，并提出全局收敛的投影梯度下降算法。

Result: 理论分析证明了正交性与块对角性在双随机约束下的等价性，并通过大量实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LoRD和B-LoRD方法在减少约束松弛的同时保持了数值可解性，显著提升了聚类性能，代码已公开。

Abstract: The well-known graph-based clustering methods, including spectral clustering,
symmetric non-negative matrix factorization, and doubly stochastic
normalization, can be viewed as relaxations of the kernel $k$-means approach.
However, we posit that these methods excessively relax their inherent low-rank,
nonnegative, doubly stochastic, and orthonormal constraints to ensure numerical
feasibility, potentially limiting their clustering efficacy. In this paper,
guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose \textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank
\textbf{D}oubly stochastic clustering (\textbf{LoRD}), a model that only
relaxes the orthonormal constraint to derive a probabilistic clustering
results. Furthermore, we theoretically establish the equivalence between
orthogonality and block diagonality under the doubly stochastic constraint. By
integrating \textbf{B}lock diagonal regularization into LoRD, expressed as the
maximization of the Frobenius norm, we propose \textbf{B-LoRD}, which further
enhances the clustering performance. To ensure numerical solvability, we
transform the non-convex doubly stochastic constraint into a linear convex
constraint through the introduction of a class probability parameter. We
further theoretically demonstrate the gradient Lipschitz continuity of our LoRD
and B-LoRD enables the proposal of a globally convergent projected gradient
descent algorithm for their optimization. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approaches. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lwl-learning/LoRD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络扩展方法中新添加的神经元往往无法适应已训练网络而变得不活跃，无法有效增加网络容量。

Method: SWE通过将新神经元与现有神经元耦合实现平滑集成，防止神经元失效；SVoD使用基于梯度的方法在深度网络扩展时优化神经元在各层的分配。

Result: 在四个数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，该方法能有效抑制神经元失效，性能优于其他扩展方法和基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络动态扩展提供了有效的解决方案，能够在不重新训练大型模型的情况下提升网络容量。

Abstract: Expanding neural networks during training is a promising way to augment
capacity without retraining larger models from scratch. However, newly added
neurons often fail to adjust to a trained network and become inactive,
providing no contribution to capacity growth. We propose the Shared-Weights
Extender (SWE), a novel method explicitly designed to prevent inactivity of new
neurons by coupling them with existing ones for smooth integration. In
parallel, we introduce the Steepest Voting Distributor (SVoD), a gradient-based
method for allocating neurons across layers during deep network expansion. Our
extensive benchmarking on four datasets shows that our method can effectively
suppress neuron inactivity and achieve better performance compared to other
expanding methods and baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在处理同质响应组（全对或全错）时存在严重缺陷，特别是当所有响应都错误时，优势函数值为零导致梯度消失，无法从错误中学习。

Method: 提出NGRPO算法：1）优势校准机制，在计算优势时假设存在虚拟最大奖励样本；2）非对称裁剪技术，放松正样本更新幅度，严格约束负样本更新幅度。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型上的实验表明，NGRPO在MATH500、AMC23和AIME2025等数学基准测试中显著优于PPO、GRPO、DAPO和PSR-NSR等基线方法。

Conclusion: NGRPO能够有效从同质错误中学习，实现数学推理能力的稳定和显著提升，解决了GRPO的关键局限性。

Abstract: RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
across various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers
from a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either
entirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these
homogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously
incorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero,
leading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To
overcome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy
Optimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust
learning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism
hypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage
calculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group
and ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no
longer zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the
update magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on
that of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure
introduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B
demonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO,
DAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and
AIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous
errors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical
reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/nangongrui-ngr/NGRPO.

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了图级学习中异质性的新理论理解，并为设计有效的GNN架构提供了指导，强调需要频率自适应而非频率主导的方法。

Abstract: While heterophily has been widely studied in node-level tasks, its impact on
graph-level tasks remains unclear. We present the first analysis of heterophily
in graph-level learning, combining theoretical insights with empirical
validation. We first introduce a taxonomy of graph-level labeling schemes, and
focus on motif-based tasks within local structure labeling, which is a popular
labeling scheme. Using energy-based gradient flow analysis, we reveal a key
insight: unlike frequency-dominated regimes in node-level tasks, motif
detection requires mixed-frequency dynamics to remain flexible across multiple
spectral components. Our theory shows that motif objectives are inherently
misaligned with global frequency dominance, demanding distinct architectural
considerations. Experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled heterophily
and real-world molecular property prediction support our findings, showing that
frequency-adaptive model outperform frequency-dominated models. This work
establishes a new theoretical understanding of heterophily in graph-level
learning and offers guidance for designing effective GNN architectures.

Motivation: 现有的联邦学习后门攻击通常依赖固定模式或对抗性扰动作为触发器，导致主任务和后门任务紧密耦合，容易被诚实更新稀释，且在联邦防御下持久性有限。

Method: 采用min-max框架动态优化后门触发器：内层最大化中毒样本与良性样本的性能差距，确保良性用户更新对后门影响最小；外层将自适应触发器注入本地模型。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言任务上评估，与6种后门攻击方法和6种防御算法比较，实验结果显示该方法具有良好的攻击性能，并能轻松集成到现有后门攻击技术中。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态触发器优化成功解耦了主任务和后门任务，显著提高了联邦学习后门攻击的持久性和抗防御能力。

Abstract: Federated learning allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a
central model without sharing their private data. However, this distributed
nature also exposes new attack surfaces. In particular, backdoor attacks allow
attackers to implant malicious behaviors into the global model while
maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. Existing attacks usually rely on
fixed patterns or adversarial perturbations as triggers, which tightly couple
the main and backdoor tasks. This coupling makes them vulnerable to dilution by
honest updates and limits their persistence under federated defenses. In this
work, we propose an approach to decouple the backdoor task from the main task
by dynamically optimizing the backdoor trigger within a min-max framework. The
inner layer maximizes the performance gap between poisoned and benign samples,
ensuring that the contributions of benign users have minimal impact on the
backdoor. The outer process injects the adaptive triggers into the local model.
We evaluate our method on both computer vision and natural language tasks, and
compare it with six backdoor attack methods under six defense algorithms.
Experimental results show that our method achieves good attack performance and
can be easily integrated into existing backdoor attack techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经算法推理存在无法构建有效解、难以处理NP难问题、依赖专家算法等局限性，需要新的框架来突破这些限制。

Method: 将算法轨迹学习问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出GNARL框架，包含从NAR到RL的问题转换方法和适用于图基问题的学习架构。

Result: 在多个CLRS-30问题上获得高图精度，NP难问题性能匹配或超越传统NAR方法，甚至在缺乏专家算法时也适用。

Conclusion: GNARL框架成功解决了NAR的核心局限性，为算法学习提供了更通用和强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) is a paradigm that trains neural networks
to execute classic algorithms by supervised learning. Despite its successes,
important limitations remain: inability to construct valid solutions without
post-processing and to reason about multiple correct ones, poor performance on
combinatorial NP-hard problems, and inapplicability to problems for which
strong algorithms are not yet known. To address these limitations, we reframe
the problem of learning algorithm trajectories as a Markov Decision Process,
which imposes structure on the solution construction procedure and unlocks the
powerful tools of imitation and reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the
GNARL framework, encompassing the methodology to translate problem formulations
from NAR to RL and a learning architecture suitable for a wide range of
graph-based problems. We achieve very high graph accuracy results on several
CLRS-30 problems, performance matching or exceeding much narrower NAR
approaches for NP-hard problems and, remarkably, applicability even when
lacking an expert algorithm.

Conclusion: 置信网络为开发隐私感知的概率图模型提供了一种原则性、实用且有效的方法，能够在隐私保护和模型效用之间实现良好平衡。

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable
efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective
across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The
structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly
learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes
increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive
information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize
privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine
the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals
belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection
tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this
offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the
model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the
resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of
releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks
(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After
adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the
masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful
attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve
meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key
learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from
recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical
experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN
hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical,
and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic
graphical models.

Result: 在11个基准数据集上验证，ζ策略在保持高精度的同时显著减少资源消耗

Conclusion: HEROS框架和ζ策略为绿色在线学习提供了有效解决方案，在性能和可持续性间取得良好平衡

Abstract: Ensemble methods for stream mining necessitate managing multiple models and
updating them as data distributions evolve. Considering the calls for more
sustainability, established methods are however not sufficiently considerate of
ensemble members' computational expenses and instead overly focus on predictive
capabilities. To address these challenges and enable green online learning, we
propose heterogeneous online ensembles (HEROS). For every training step, HEROS
chooses a subset of models from a pool of models initialized with diverse
hyperparameter choices under resource constraints to train. We introduce a
Markov decision process to theoretically capture the trade-offs between
predictive performance and sustainability constraints. Based on this framework,
we present different policies for choosing which models to train on incoming
data. Most notably, we propose the novel $\zeta$-policy, which focuses on
training near-optimal models at reduced costs. Using a stochastic model, we
theoretically prove that our $\zeta$-policy achieves near optimal performance
while using fewer resources compared to the best performing policy. In our
experiments across 11 benchmark datasets, we find empiric evidence that our
$\zeta$-policy is a strong contribution to the state-of-the-art, demonstrating
highly accurate performance, in some cases even outperforming competitors, and
simultaneously being much more resource-friendly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Otters的新型光电突触设计，利用光电设备的自然信号衰减特性来实现时间到首次脉冲编码，从而消除昂贵的数字运算，显著提高脉冲神经网络的能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脉冲神经网络（SNNs）特别是时间到首次脉冲编码虽然承诺高能效，但由于需要评估时间衰减函数和突触权重乘法，实际能效优势往往无法实现。

Method: 通过制造定制氧化铟光电突触，利用其自然物理衰减直接实现所需的时间函数；引入量化神经网络到SNN的转换算法，解决复杂架构训练难题；采用硬件-软件协同设计方法。

Result: 在七个GLUE基准数据集上达到最先进准确率，基于商业22nm工艺的能耗分析显示比之前领先SNNs能效提高1.77倍。

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的能效SNN范式，将基础设备物理特性直接转化为强大的计算原语，为高效SNN系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise high energy efficiency, particularly
with time-to-first-spike (TTFS) encoding, which maximizes sparsity by emitting
at most one spike per neuron. However, such energy advantage is often
unrealized because inference requires evaluating a temporal decay function and
subsequent multiplication with the synaptic weights. This paper challenges this
costly approach by repurposing a physical hardware `bug', namely, the natural
signal decay in optoelectronic devices, as the core computation of TTFS. We
fabricated a custom indium oxide optoelectronic synapse, showing how its
natural physical decay directly implements the required temporal function. By
treating the device's analog output as the fused product of the synaptic weight
and temporal decay, optoelectronic synaptic TTFS (named Otters) eliminates
these expensive digital operations. To use the Otters paradigm in complex
architectures like the transformer, which are challenging to train directly due
to the sparsity issue, we introduce a novel quantized neural network-to-SNN
conversion algorithm. This complete hardware-software co-design enables our
model to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across seven GLUE benchmark datasets
and demonstrates a 1.77$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over previous
leading SNNs, based on a comprehensive analysis of compute, data movement, and
memory access costs using energy measurements from a commercial 22nm process.
Our work thus establishes a new paradigm for energy-efficient SNNs, translating
fundamental device physics directly into powerful computational primitives. All
codes and data are open source.

Motivation: SGNNs在真实世界标签有限或不可观测的领域取得了最先进性能，但缺乏正式的理论基础。本文旨在为仿真基础学习提供理论基础。

Method: 通过理论分析证明SGNNs实现摊销贝叶斯推断，推导模型错误设定下的泛化界限，并形式化SGNNs独有的机制可解释性方法。通过数值实验验证理论预测。

Conclusion: 这些结果确立了SGNNs作为数据受限情况下科学预测的原则性和实用框架。

Abstract: Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained
entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or
unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
  We present the foundational theory of simulation-grounded learning. We show
that SGNNs implement amortized Bayesian inference under a simulation prior and
converge to the Bayes-optimal predictor. We derive generalization bounds under
model misspecification and prove that SGNNs can learn unobservable scientific
quantities that empirical methods provably cannot. We also formalize a novel
form of mechanistic interpretability uniquely enabled by SGNNs: by attributing
predictions to the simulated mechanisms that generated them, SGNNs yield
posterior-consistent, scientifically grounded explanations.
  We provide numerical experiments to validate all theoretical predictions.
SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform
classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC
in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a
principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited
regimes.

Method: 提出跨层低秩残差网络（CR-Net），采用双路径架构，通过结合前一层输出与其低秩差异来高效重构层激活，并开发专门的重计算策略来减少内存需求。

Conclusion: CR-Net成功解决了当前低秩方法的局限性，证明了利用层间激活残差低秩特性的有效性，为大语言模型的高效预训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-rank architectures have become increasingly important for efficient large
language model (LLM) pre-training, providing substantial reductions in both
parameter complexity and memory/computational demands. Despite these
advantages, current low-rank methods face three critical shortcomings: (1)
compromised model performance, (2) considerable computational overhead, and (3)
limited activation memory savings. To address these limitations, we propose
Cross-layer Low-Rank residual Network (CR-Net), an innovative
parameter-efficient framework inspired by our discovery that inter-layer
activation residuals possess low-rank properties. CR-Net implements this
insight through a dual-path architecture that efficiently reconstructs layer
activations by combining previous-layer outputs with their low-rank
differences, thereby maintaining high-rank information with minimal parameters.
We further develop a specialized activation recomputation strategy tailored for
CR-Net that dramatically reduces memory requirements. Extensive pre-training
experiments across model scales from 60M to 7B parameters demonstrate that
CR-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank frameworks while
requiring fewer computational resources and less memory.

Abstract: Representation learning from unlabeled data has been extensively studied in
statistics, data science and signal processing with a rich literature on
techniques for dimension reduction, compression, multi-dimensional scaling
among others. However, current deep learning models use new principles for
unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using
classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous
success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which
effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data.
However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by
these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks
or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine
mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an
overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from
unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.

Motivation: 解决传统方法对预定义符号接地函数或先验任务知识的依赖问题，使非马尔可夫RL任务更易应用且更具可解释性。

Method: 将完全可学习的奖励机与深度强化学习结合，通过端到端学习同时获得符号接地函数和自动机表示。

Conclusion: 该方法既保持了深度RL的易用性，又通过有限自动机的紧凑性提供了更好的可解释性，是解决非马尔可夫RL任务的有效方案。

Abstract: Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks present significant
challenges, as agents must reason over entire trajectories of state-action
pairs to make optimal decisions. A common strategy to address this is through
symbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which
provide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However,
these approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the
availability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw
observations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the
temporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural
Reward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton
end-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore
as easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more
explainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore,
we show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL,
our method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs).

Method: 采用语言中心设计重用预训练LLM，引入轻量级双向潜在对齐模块，提出两阶段解耦训练策略：监督微调+潜在空间对齐用于对齐LLM行为与多模态推理，语义引导扩散训练通过可学习查询嵌入对齐跨模态潜在空间。

Result: 在广泛基准测试中，OmniBridge在所有三个任务上都取得了竞争性或最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果证明了潜在空间对齐在共享表示空间下统一多模态建模的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to
significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks.
However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require
training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited
generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a
unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language
understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture.
OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and
introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the
challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM
behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to
align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge
achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks.
Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for
unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and
models are released at https://github.com/xiao-xt/OmniBridge.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的GAN方法能有效克服欺诈检测中的严重类别不平衡问题，生成高质量合成少数类样本。

Abstract: Detection of credit card fraud is an acute issue of financial security
because transaction datasets are highly lopsided, with fraud cases being only a
drop in the ocean. Balancing datasets using the most popular methods of
traditional oversampling such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE) generally create simplistic synthetic samples that are not readily
applicable to complex fraud patterns. Recent industry advances that include
Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and Tabular
Variational Autoencoders (TVAE) have demonstrated increased efficiency in
tabular synthesis, yet all these models still exhibit issues with
high-dimensional dependence modelling. Now we will present our hybrid approach
where we use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Transformer encoder
block to produce realistic fraudulent transactions samples. The GAN
architecture allows training realistic generators adversarial, and the
Transformer allows the model to learn rich feature interactions by
self-attention. Such a hybrid strategy overcomes the limitations of SMOTE,
CTGAN, and TVAE by producing a variety of high-quality synthetic minority
classes samples. We test our algorithm on the publicly-available Credit Card
Fraud Detection dataset and compare it to conventional and generative
resampling strategies with a variety of classifiers, such as Logistic
Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and
Support Vector Machine (SVM). Findings indicate that our Transformer-based GAN
shows substantial gains in Recall, F1-score and Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which indicates that it is effective in
overcoming the severe class imbalance inherent in the task of fraud detection.

Motivation: 现有的黑盒对抗攻击方法通常依赖于特定网络架构或需要大量查询，导致跨架构迁移性差且查询成本高。

Method: JAD利用潜在扩散模型，通过从CNN和ViT模型中提取的注意力图来指导生成对抗扰动，关注跨架构共同敏感的图像区域。

Result: 实验表明JAD在攻击泛化性、生成效率和跨架构迁移性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JAD为黑盒对抗攻击提供了一个有前景的有效范式，具有架构无关性和高生成效率的优势。

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to
model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network
architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited
cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these
limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box
adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent
diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on
image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach
crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different
model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be
architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse
models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high
adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative
queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack
generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability
compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for
black-box adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的计算和能耗需求不断增长，主要由反向传播驱动，这挑战了可持续AI发展。需要寻找更高效的训练方法。

Method: 建立了稳健的比较框架：在原生架构上实现三种BP-free算法（FF和MF用MLP，CaFo用CNN），与等效BP模型对比。使用Optuna优化超参数，基于验证性能应用一致的早停标准。

Result: MF在MLP上的分类精度不仅与BP相当，而且持续超越BP。硬件层面测量显示MF降低能耗41%，缩短训练时间34%，碳足迹显著减小。

Conclusion: MF通过在验证损失景观中找到更有利的最小值实现优越泛化，挑战了全局优化必要性的假设。该工作为未来能效深度学习提供了清晰的数据驱动路线图。

Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of deep neural networks (DNNs),
driven largely by backpropagation (BP), challenge sustainable AI development.
This paper rigorously investigates three BP-free training methods: the
Forward-Forward (FF), Cascaded-Forward (CaFo), and Mono-Forward (MF)
algorithms, tracing their progression from foundational concepts to a
demonstrably superior solution.
  A robust comparative framework was established: each algorithm was
implemented on its native architecture (MLPs for FF and MF, a CNN for CaFo) and
benchmarked against an equivalent BP-trained model. Hyperparameters were
optimized with Optuna, and consistent early stopping criteria were applied
based on validation performance, ensuring all models were optimally tuned
before comparison.
  Results show that MF not only competes with but consistently surpasses BP in
classification accuracy on its native MLPs. Its superior generalization stems
from converging to a more favorable minimum in the validation loss landscape,
challenging the assumption that global optimization is required for
state-of-the-art results. Measured at the hardware level using the NVIDIA
Management Library (NVML) API, MF reduces energy consumption by up to 41% and
shortens training time by up to 34%, translating to a measurably smaller carbon
footprint as estimated by CodeCarbon.
  Beyond this primary result, we present a hardware-level analysis that
explains the efficiency gains: exposing FF's architectural inefficiencies,
validating MF's computationally lean design, and challenging the assumption
that all BP-free methods are inherently more memory-efficient. By documenting
the evolution from FF's conceptual groundwork to MF's synthesis of accuracy and
sustainability, this work offers a clear, data-driven roadmap for future
energy-efficient deep learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI)，一种改进的变分推断方法，通过从可学习的数据依赖初始分布开始反向扩散，解决了DDVI在深度高斯过程后验推断中的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DDVI方法使用固定的无条件起始分布，与复杂真实后验分布差距较大，导致推断轨迹效率低下和收敛缓慢。

Method: DBVI通过参数化的摊销神经网络初始化数据依赖的起始分布，利用ELBO目标的梯度逐步调整，减少后验差距。网络设计为在诱导输入上操作，实现可扩展的摊销。

Conclusion: DBVI保持了DDVI的数学优雅性，同时通过可学习的桥接扩散过程显著提高了深度高斯过程后验推断的效率和性能。

Abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian
modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially
over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI)
addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a
simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting
distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in
inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we
propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension
of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent
initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized
neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO
objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To
enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing
inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and
naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the
mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time
SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We
derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI
for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification,
and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other
variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior
quality.

Result: 在节点分类和影响力估计基准测试中，AxelGNN在各种具有不同同质性-异质性特征的图结构上始终优于或匹配最先进的GNN方法。

Conclusion: AxelGNN的双稳态收敛动力学自然处理同质性和异质性图，为图神经网络提供了统一的框架，有效解决了现有GNN的基本局限性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations:
feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become
indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage
heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and
they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits
flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel
GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that
addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates
similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence
or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying
mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and
maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple
representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally
handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture.
Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation
benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying
homophily-heterophily characteristics.

setting: before any pulls, the learner is given N'_k i.i.d. samples from each
source distribution nu'_k, and the true target distributions nu_k lie within a
known distance bound d_k(nu_k, nu'_k) <= L_k. In this framework, we first
derive a problem-dependent asymptotic lower bound on cumulative regret that
extends the classical Lai-Robbins result to incorporate the transfer parameters
(d_k, L_k, N'_k). We then propose KL-UCB-Transfer, a simple index policy that
matches this new bound in the Gaussian case. Finally, we validate our approach
via simulations, showing that KL-UCB-Transfer significantly outperforms the
no-prior baseline when source and target distributions are sufficiently close.

Abstract: Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical
applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against
adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we
discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable
robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in
computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training
paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of
domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to
generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test
distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art
generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image
classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language
models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that
elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses,
which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based
agents.

*Sharan Sahu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-REBEL是一种鲁棒的离线RLHF方法，通过Wasserstein、KL和χ²模糊集解决奖励错误指定导致的过拟合问题，在保持可扩展性的同时实现最优参数化收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线RLHF方法存在过优化问题，模型会过度拟合奖励错误指定并偏离训练期间观察到的偏好行为。

Method: 提出统一的DRO-REBEL更新框架，通过Fenchel对偶将问题简化为相对奖励回归，避免了PPO风格的裁剪和辅助价值网络。推导了三种散度的实用SGD算法：梯度正则化(Wasserstein)、重要性加权(KL)和快速一维对偶求解(χ²)。

Result: 在Emotion Alignment、ArmoRM多目标基准和HH-Alignment上的实验表明，该方法在未见偏好混合、模型大小和数据规模上具有强大的最坏情况鲁棒性，χ²-REBEL表现出持续强劲的实证性能。

Conclusion: 控制半径-覆盖研究验证了无免费午餐权衡：半径收缩速度快于经验散度集中率可实现极小极大最优参数化率但会丧失覆盖，而保证覆盖的半径会带来O(n^{-1/4})的收敛率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become crucial for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, existing
offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to
reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during
training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with
type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality,
each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving
scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under
standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage
condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants
than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$
rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes
the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal
parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences:
gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast
1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale
ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong
worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data
scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance.
A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii
shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve
minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while
coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.

Motivation: 理解事件序列中的因果关系对于医疗、车辆诊断等领域至关重要，但目前仍是一个未解决的挑战，特别是在处理包含数千种事件类型的高维稀疏序列时。

Method: 使用两个预训练的因果Transformer作为领域特定的基础模型，并行推断每个序列的因果图，然后通过自适应频率融合聚合这些图来重建标签的全局马尔可夫边界。

Result: 在包含29,100个唯一事件类型和474个不平衡标签的真实世界汽车故障预测数据集上，CARGO能够进行结构化推理。

Conclusion: 这种两阶段方法能够在规模上实现高效的概率推理，同时避免了全数据集条件独立性测试的不可行成本。

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as
diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error
codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like
healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label
causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising
of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as
domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in
parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an
adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of
labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at
scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional
independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault
prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced
labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.

Motivation: 联邦学习在医疗等敏感领域面临非IID数据、客户端不可靠性和对抗性操纵的挑战，需要更鲁棒和公平的解决方案。

Method: 采用三阶段参与策略（自由训练、自然选择、槽位团队参与），结合动态客户端评分、自适应阈值和基于队列的调度，平衡收敛效率和鲁棒性。

Result: 在医学影像、视觉基准和表格农业数据上的实验表明，FedFiTS在准确性、收敛速度和抗中毒攻击能力上优于FedAvg、FedRand和FedPow。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
privacy-preserving model training, yet deployments in sensitive domains such as
healthcare face persistent challenges from non-IID data, client unreliability,
and adversarial manipulation. This paper introduces FedFiTS, a trust and
fairness-aware selective FL framework that advances the FedFaSt line by
combining fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation. FedFiTS
implements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural
selection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client
scoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance
convergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis
establishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard
assumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions
relative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical
imaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular
agricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently
outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and
resilience to poisoning attacks. By integrating trust-aware aggregation with
fairness-oriented client selection, FedFiTS advances scalable and secure FL,
making it well suited for real-world healthcare and cross-domain deployments.

Conclusion: 标准差向量和聚类向量是分析大语言模型权重特征的有效工具，能揭示模型间的差异和相关性，对模型理解和优化具有重要价值。

Abstract: The study on architecture and parameter characteristics remains the hot topic
in the research of large language models. In this paper we concern with the
characteristics of weight which are used to analyze the correlations and
differences between models. Two kinds of vectors-standard deviation vector and
clustering vector-are proposed to describe features of models. In the first
case, the weights are assumed to follow normal distribution. The standard
deviation values of projection matrices are normalized to form
Standard-Deviation Vector, representing the distribution characteristics of
models. In the second case, the singular values from each weight projection
matrix are extracted and grouped by K-Means algorithm. The grouped data with
the same type matrix are combined as Clustering Vector to represent the
correlation characteristics of models' weights. The study reveals that these
two vectors can effectively distinguish between different models and clearly
show the similarities among models of the same family. Moreover, after
conducting LoRA fine-tuning with different datasets and models, it is found
that the distribution of weights represented by standard deviation vector is
directly influenced by the dataset, but the correlations between different
weights represented by clustering vector remain unaffected and maintain a high
consistency with the pre-trained model.

Conclusion: PipelineRL提供了一种可扩展且模块化的解决方案，有效解决了大语言模型RL训练中的硬件效率和数据时效性平衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling
these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the
difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating
stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces
PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between
hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs
concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by
the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation
engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the
generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator
utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on
long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL
achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL
baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and
modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key
contribution.

TL;DR: GSTM-HMU是一个生成式时空框架，通过显式建模人类移动的语义和时间复杂性来推进移动性分析。该框架包含四个关键创新：时空概念编码器、认知轨迹记忆、生活方式概念库和任务导向生成头。

Motivation: 人类移动轨迹记录了签到序列，为短期访问模式和持久生活方式规律提供了独特窗口。现有方法未能充分建模移动数据的语义和时间复杂性。

Method: 1) STCE整合地理位置、POI类别语义和周期性时间节奏；2) CTM自适应过滤历史访问，强调近期和行为显著事件；3) LCB提供结构化人类偏好线索；4) 任务导向生成头将学习表示转换为下游任务预测。

Result: 在Gowalla、WeePlace、Brightkite和FourSquare四个真实数据集上的实验显示，在下一个位置预测、轨迹用户识别和时间估计三个基准任务上均取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 生成式建模为构建更鲁棒、可解释和可泛化的人类移动智能系统提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a
unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle
regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal
framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the
semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of
four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE)
integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal
rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory
Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and
behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively.
Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference
cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance
interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads
transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream
tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world
datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate
performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user
identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and
substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of
GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond
raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling
provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and
generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.

Conclusion: 激活函数的梯度稀疏性在减少遗忘中起重要作用，大象激活函数为解决灾难性遗忘问题提供了有效的架构层面解决方案。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a significant challenge for efficient
reinforcement learning for decades (Ring 1994, Rivest and Precup 2003). While
recent works have proposed effective methods to mitigate this issue, they
mainly focus on the algorithmic side. Meanwhile, we do not fully understand
what architectural properties of neural networks lead to catastrophic
forgetting. This study aims to fill this gap by studying the role of activation
functions in the training dynamics of neural networks and their impact on
catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning setup. Our study reveals
that, besides sparse representations, the gradient sparsity of activation
functions also plays an important role in reducing forgetting. Based on this
insight, we propose a new class of activation functions, elephant activation
functions, that can generate both sparse outputs and sparse gradients. We show
that by simply replacing classical activation functions with elephant
activation functions in the neural networks of value-based algorithms, we can
significantly improve the resilience of neural networks to catastrophic
forgetting, thus making reinforcement learning more sample-efficient and
memory-efficient.

Method: 使用师生核回归设置和在线随机梯度下降，通过内在时间视角和随机微分方程建模，提出功能缩放定律来表征不同学习率调度下总体风险的演化。

Result: FSL能够准确捕捉学习率调度的影响，理论验证了高容量模型更高效、学习率衰减提升效率、WSD调度优于直接衰减等经验实践。在0.1B到1B参数规模的实验中验证了FSL的实用性。

Conclusion: FSL框架深化了对LLM预训练动态的理解，为大规模模型训练提供了理论指导和优化insights。

Abstract: Scaling laws have played a cornerstone role in guiding the training of large
language models (LLMs). However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily
focus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training
process and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this
paper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel
regression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
Leveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential
equation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL),
which characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training
process for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured
through an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects
fully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used
LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under
both data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical
justification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such
as (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)
learning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules
can outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical
relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing
the loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model
sizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen
the understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for
improving large-scale model training.

Abstract: Data-driven models, especially deep learning classifiers often demonstrate
great success on clean datasets. Yet, they remain vulnerable to common data
distortions such as adversarial and common corruption perturbations. These
perturbations can significantly degrade performance, thereby challenging the
overall reliability of the models. Traditional robustness validation typically
relies on perturbed test datasets to assess and improve model performance. In
our framework, however, we propose a validation approach that extracts "weak
robust" samples directly from the training dataset via local robustness
analysis. These samples, being the most susceptible to perturbations, serve as
an early and sensitive indicator of the model's vulnerabilities. By evaluating
models on these challenging training instances, we gain a more nuanced
understanding of its robustness, which informs targeted performance
enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on models trained
with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, highlighting how robustness validation
guided by weak robust samples can drive meaningful improvements in model
reliability under adversarial and common corruption scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际联邦学习面临异构特征空间、严重非IID数据和跨客户端标签稀缺的挑战，需要一种能够同时处理这些现实约束的解决方案。

Method: 使用标记的教师客户端通过置信度过滤的伪标签和域自适应迁移指导学习客户端，同时客户端维护针对本地数据的个性化编码器。采用相似性加权分类器耦合（可选聚类平均）来保持全局一致性，减少数据丰富站点的支配并改善少数客户端性能。节俭标注管道结合自监督/半监督预训练与选择性微调。

Result: 在表格和图像基准测试中，FedFusion在IID、非IID和标签稀缺情况下，在准确性、鲁棒性和公平性方面始终优于最先进的基线方法，同时保持可比较的通信和计算预算。

Conclusion: 协调个性化、域适应和标签效率是现实约束下实现鲁棒联邦学习的有效方法。

Abstract: Federated learning in practice must contend with heterogeneous feature
spaces, severe non-IID data, and scarce labels across clients. We present
FedFusion, a federated transfer-learning framework that unifies domain
adaptation and frugal labelling with diversity-/cluster-aware encoders (DivEn,
DivEn-mix, DivEn-c). Labelled teacher clients guide learner clients via
confidence-filtered pseudo-labels and domain-adaptive transfer, while clients
maintain personalised encoders tailored to local data. To preserve global
coherence under heterogeneity, FedFusion employs similarity-weighted classifier
coupling (with optional cluster-wise averaging), mitigating dominance by
data-rich sites and improving minority-client performance. The frugal-labelling
pipeline combines self-/semi-supervised pretext training with selective
fine-tuning, reducing annotation demands without sharing raw data. Across
tabular and imaging benchmarks under IID, non-IID, and label-scarce regimes,
FedFusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy,
robustness, and fairness while maintaining comparable communication and
computation budgets. These results show that harmonising personalisation,
domain adaptation, and label efficiency is an effective recipe for robust
federated learning under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have enabled the creation
of high-fidelity, temporally coherent clips from natural language prompts. Yet
these systems come with significant computational costs, and their energy
demands remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic study
of the latency and energy consumption of state-of-the-art open-source T2V
models. We first develop a compute-bound analytical model that predicts scaling
laws with respect to spatial resolution, temporal length, and denoising steps.
We then validate these predictions through fine-grained experiments on
WAN2.1-T2V, showing quadratic growth with spatial and temporal dimensions, and
linear scaling with the number of denoising steps. Finally, we extend our
analysis to six diverse T2V models, comparing their runtime and energy profiles
under default settings. Our results provide both a benchmark reference and
practical insights for designing and deploying more sustainable generative
video systems.

Abstract: In the context of the energy transition, with increasing integration of
renewable sources and cross-border electricity exchanges, power grids are
encountering greater uncertainty and operational risk. Maintaining grid
stability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators
are commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before
implementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are
often too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as
fast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g.,
Kirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are
also known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an
ablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from
incorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised
losses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to
advanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics
equations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called
LIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical
compliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The
results highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across
these criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the
corresponding Github page.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于稳定性的对抗训练泛化分析，针对去中心化网络中的扩散策略，揭示了泛化误差随对抗扰动强度和训练步数增长的理论界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然对抗训练能增强模型鲁棒性，但存在鲁棒过拟合和泛化差距扩大的问题。现有研究已证明去中心化网络中对抗训练的收敛性，但其泛化特性尚未被探索。

Method: 采用基于稳定性的分析方法，针对凸损失函数下的扩散策略对抗训练，推导泛化误差的理论界限。

Result: 理论分析表明泛化误差随对抗扰动强度和训练步数增长，这一发现在单智能体情况下一致，但在去中心化设置中是新颖的。逻辑回归数值实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 该研究首次在去中心化环境中建立了对抗训练的泛化理论，为理解分布式对抗学习的泛化行为提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is an established tool for analyzing generalization.
While adversarial training enhances model robustness, it often suffers from
robust overfitting and an enlarged generalization gap. Although recent work has
established the convergence of adversarial training in decentralized networks,
its generalization properties remain unexplored. This work presents a
stability-based generalization analysis of adversarial training under the
diffusion strategy for convex losses. We derive a bound showing that the
generalization error grows with both the adversarial perturbation strength and
the number of training steps, a finding consistent with single-agent case but
novel for decentralized settings. Numerical experiments on logistic regression
validate these theoretical predictions.

### [296] [What Characterizes Effective Reasoning? Revisiting Length, Review, and Structure of CoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19284)
*Yunzhen Feng,Julia Kempe,Cheng Zhang,Parag Jain,Anthony Hartshorn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在大型推理模型中，更长的思维链（CoT）和更多的回顾步骤反而会降低准确性，提出了"失败步骤比例（FSF）"作为评估CoT质量的关键指标，并证明减少失败分支能显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在测试时需要大量计算资源处理长思维链，但什么构成有效的思维链仍不清楚。先前研究认为更长的思维链和更多回顾步骤能提升性能，但近期研究表明短思维链可能表现更好，因此需要系统性评估。

Method: 在10个大型推理模型上进行数学和科学推理的系统评估，引入思维链的图结构视图，提出失败步骤比例（FSF）指标，并设计两种干预实验：基于指标排序候选思维链和编辑思维链移除失败分支。

Result: 研究发现思维链长度和回顾比例与准确性呈负相关，失败步骤比例（FSF）能更好地预测正确性。通过移除失败分支的干预实验显著提升了模型准确性，表明失败分支会干扰后续推理。

Conclusion: 有效的思维链是那些失败步骤较少的思维链，支持基于结构感知的测试时扩展策略，而不是无差别地生成长思维链。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long
chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT
remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and
increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent
studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We
therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and
scientific reasoning. Contrary to the "longer-is-better" narrative, we find
that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with
*lower* accuracy.
  As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with
process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and
identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of
steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review
ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two
interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where
FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed
branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed
branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize
effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware*
test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了零样本深度伪造检测技术，结合自监督学习、Transformer分类器、生成模型指纹识别和元学习等方法，并提出了AI驱动的预防策略，包括对抗性扰动、数字水印、实时监控和区块链验证。

Conclusion: 需要结合零样本学习和预防机制的综合防御框架，并强调AI研究人员、网络安全专家和政策制定者之间的跨学科合作，以建立对深度伪造攻击的弹性防御体系。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically
advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media
integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored
zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have
never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied
self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative
model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the
ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention
strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes
before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating
deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity
verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and
blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements,
zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as
adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence
of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by
discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection,
multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for
enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake
detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense
framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in
combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the
important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers,
cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against
the rising tide of deepfake attacks.

*Kaiwen Jiang,Jia-Mu Sun,Zilu Li,Dan Wang,Tzu-Mao Li,Ravi Ramamoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯面元的高效可微分光传输框架，解决了传统辐射场方法在材质反射特性和光照建模方面的不足，实现了高质量的几何重建、视图合成和重光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统辐射场方法牺牲了材质反射特性和光照条件的建模，导致几何模糊且无法进行重光照。现有方法虽然尝试引入基于物理的渲染，但全局光照计算成本过高，通常采用简化方案导致精度不足。

Method: 采用高斯面元作为基元，基于经典辐射度理论构建可微分光传输框架。在球谐系数空间中操作，支持漫反射和镜面材质。扩展了经典辐射度方法，引入非二元可见性和半透明基元，提出高效的光传输求解器，并推导了比自动微分更高效的梯度优化反向传播。

Result: 在推理阶段实现了视角无关的渲染，光照传输无需随视角变化重新计算，能够以数百FPS实现全局光照效果（包括视角相关的反射）。在几何重建、视图合成和重光照方面均优于现有的逆向渲染基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在已知或未知光照条件的相对稀疏数据集上，通过定性和定量实验证明了其在几何重建、视图合成和重光照方面的优越性能，为高质量可微分渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from
novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of
Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective
properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric
ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address
these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been
prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner
loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that
make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less
accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build
an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the
classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space
of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend
the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives,
propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the
backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than
auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering
where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling
hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent
reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry
reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering
baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known
or unknown lighting conditions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Text Slider是一个轻量级、高效的即插即用框架，通过在预训练文本编码器中识别低秩方向，实现对视觉概念的连续控制，显著减少训练时间、GPU内存消耗和可训练参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念控制方法需要大量训练时间和GPU内存来学习滑块或嵌入，并且需要为不同的扩散主干网络重新训练，限制了其可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 在预训练文本编码器中识别低秩方向，实现连续控制，支持多概念组合和连续控制，在图像和视频合成中实现细粒度和灵活的操作。

Result: Text Slider实现了平滑连续的特定属性调制，同时保留输入的空间布局和结构。训练速度比Concept Slider快5倍，比Attribute Control快47倍，GPU内存使用分别减少近2倍和4倍。

Conclusion: Text Slider是一个高效、轻量的框架，能够实现连续、细粒度的视觉概念控制，具有更好的可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and
video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been
proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over
free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive
training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also
need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their
scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text
Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies
low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous
control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU
memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text
Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling
fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We
show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific
attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the
input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster
training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control,
while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$,
respectively.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques,
and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform
retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style
transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is
becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized
by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties,
which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore
the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel
contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content
features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of
image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and
then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of
pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture
fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the
whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from
content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to
further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation.
Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with
only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer,
we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior
methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three
additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and
appearance transfer.
