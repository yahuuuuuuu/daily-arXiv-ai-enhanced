### [1] [Cropland Mapping using Geospatial Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02923)
*Ivan Zvonkov,Gabriel Tseng,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Hannah Kerner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估地理空间嵌入在Togo农田制图中的应用效果，发现其能简化工作流程并实现高精度农田分类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确及时的土地覆盖图对于理解土地利用变化至关重要，地理空间嵌入提供了更高效的地图制作方式，但实际应用仍待探索

Method: 使用Presto和AlphaEarth的地理空间嵌入来生成Togo的农田地图

Result: 地理空间嵌入能够简化工作流程，实现高精度的农田分类

Conclusion: 地理空间嵌入最终能支持更好的土地利用变化评估及其气候影响分析

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land
use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more
efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in
real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we
evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We
produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our
findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve
high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments
of land use change and its climate impacts.

### [2] [Generative Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02933)
*Andy Dimnaku,Abdullah Yusuf Kavranoğlu,Yaser Abu-Mostafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出生成式提示训练方法，通过生成模型创建虚拟样本来直接强制执行已知的不变性属性，优于传统数据增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强仅在训练数据的变换上学习不变性，无法完全捕获这些属性，需要在整个输入空间中直接强制执行已知的不变性。

Method: 使用在训练集上训练的生成模型生成未标记的虚拟图像，然后在半监督方式下同时训练分类和提示目标，利用虚拟样本来引导模型学习期望的提示属性。

Result: 在多个数据集、架构和损失函数上，生成式提示在学习相同属性时始终优于标准数据增强，在细粒度视觉分类基准上获得最高1.78%的top-1准确率提升，在CheXpert X射线数据集上平均提升1.286%。

Conclusion: 生成式提示是一种有效的训练方法，能够直接在整个输入空间中强制执行已知的不变性，比传统数据增强方法表现更好。

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and
mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,
such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by
data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on
transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a
training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire
input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training
set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which
we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce
functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the
training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised
manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled
virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across
datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently
outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On
popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%
top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data
augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray
dataset.

### [3] [ProM3E: Probabilistic Masked MultiModal Embedding Model for Ecology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02946)
*Srikumar Sastry,Subash Khanal,Aayush Dhakal,Jiayu Lin,Dan Cher,Phoenix Jarosz,Nathan Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProM3E是一个概率性掩码多模态嵌入模型，用于生态学中任意模态到任意模态的生成，通过掩码模态重建学习推断缺失模态，支持嵌入空间中的模态反转，并提出新颖的跨模态检索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生态学中多模态数据融合和跨模态检索的挑战，学习如何有效融合不同模态并分析融合可行性。

Method: 基于掩码模态重建在嵌入空间中学习，通过概率模型推断缺失模态，支持模态反转，并采用混合跨模态和同模态相似度的检索方法。

Result: 模型在跨模态检索任务中表现出优越性能，通过线性探测任务展示了其优秀的表示学习能力。

Conclusion: ProM3E为生态学多模态分析提供了有效的任意模态生成和检索解决方案，代码和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for
any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is
based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to
infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model
supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of
our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for
given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features
of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes
inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across
all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our
model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior
representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and
model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

### [4] [EvtSlowTV -- A Large and Diverse Dataset for Event-Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02953)
*Sadiq Layi Macaulay,Nimet Kaygusuz,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EvtSlowTV，一个从YouTube视频构建的大规模事件相机数据集，包含130亿个事件，用于自监督深度估计，无需帧级标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件相机深度估计方法受限于小规模标注数据集，难以泛化到真实世界场景。

Method: 从YouTube慢动作视频构建大规模事件数据集EvtSlowTV，采用自监督学习框架利用事件流的高动态范围特性。

Result: EvtSlowTV比现有事件数据集大一个数量级，训练后的模型能更好地泛化到复杂场景和运动。

Conclusion: EvtSlowTV数据集为事件相机深度估计提供了大规模、无约束的自然场景数据，支持自监督学习并保持事件数据的异步特性。

Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a
promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments.
However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by
small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event
camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains
more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,
including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.
EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth
learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised
learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We
further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability
to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for
frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

### [5] [Hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer NAS Search Space for TinyML Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02992)
*Mikhael Djajapermana,Moritz Reiber,Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder,Ulf Schlichtmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合CNN-ViT搜索空间，用于神经架构搜索，以寻找适合tinyML部署的高效图像分类架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合CNN-ViT架构参数量大、计算成本高，不适合tinyML部署。

Method: 设计了包含混合CNN和ViT块以及可搜索池化层的新型搜索空间，用于学习局部和全局信息并高效减少特征图。

Result: 在CIFAR10数据集上的实验表明，该搜索空间能在严格模型大小约束下产生比基于ResNet的tinyML模型具有更高准确率和推理速度的混合架构。

Conclusion: 提出的搜索空间能有效找到适合tinyML的高效混合CNN-ViT架构。

Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)
have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these
architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs,
they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid
CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient
hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid
CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel
Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.
Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space
can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference
speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

### [6] [SCALE-VLP: Soft-Weighted Contrastive Volumetric Vision-Language Pre-training with Spatial-Knowledge Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02996)
*Ailar Mahdizadeh,Puria Azadi Moghadam,Xiangteng He,Shahriar Mirabbasi,Panos Nasiopoulos,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALE-VLP是一个软加权对比视觉语言预训练框架，专门针对3D医学影像数据设计，通过整合体积空间语义和领域知识，在有限监督下实现结构一致和语义基础的表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要局限于2D数据，将体积扫描视为独立2D切片处理，破坏了空间连贯性且未能充分利用丰富的临床语义信息。

Method: 提出软加权对比学习框架，整合体积空间语义以保留解剖结构，并融入领域知识（如放射学本体）来指导对齐。

Result: 在CT报告检索中达到比之前SOTA高4.3倍的top-1准确率，异常分类提升10个百分点，报告生成达到ROUGE-L 0.44和BERT-F1 0.89。在零样本跨域评估中也观察到一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: SCALE-VLP展示了强大的跨任务可迁移性和跨域泛化能力，无需进一步微调即可获得一致性能提升。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

### [7] [Learning with less: label-efficient land cover classification at very high spatial resolution using self-supervised deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03004)
*Dakota Hester,Vitor S. Martins,Lucas B. Ferreira,Thainara M. A. Lima*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自监督学习的高效标签方法，仅使用1000个标注图像块就能实现全州范围的1米分辨率土地覆盖分类，准确率达到87.14%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率土地覆盖分类中大规模标注数据收集困难的问题，降低模型部署的障碍。

Method: 使用BYOL自监督预训练策略在大量未标记彩色红外航空图像上预训练ResNet-101编码器，然后将学习到的权重迁移到多个深度语义分割架构中进行微调。

Result: 在密西西比州超过1230亿像素的区域实现了87.14%的总体准确率和75.58%的宏F1分数，准确映射了开放水域和森林区域，但在区分农田、草本植物和贫瘠土地方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: 自监督学习是减少手动标注数据需求的有效策略，直接解决了大规模高空间分辨率土地覆盖制图的主要限制。

Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance
for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of
collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant
barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover
mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient
approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated
reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the
"Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of
unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to
pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were
subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures
(FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then
fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250,
500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall
accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing
U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more
than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water
and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation
between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show
that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need
for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major
limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

### [8] [A Foundation Model for Brain MRI with Dynamic Modality Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03014)
*Minh Sao Khue Luu,Bair N. Tuchinov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于脑MRI的基础模型，能够处理不同成像序列组合。该模型使用单一编码器，通过可学习的模态嵌入、条件层归一化和考虑缺失模态的掩码自编码目标来实现多模态适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每种模态组合训练单独模型，无法灵活处理缺失或未见过的成像序列。需要一个统一的模型来适应不同的模态组合。

Method: 使用单一编码器架构，包含可学习的模态嵌入、条件层归一化和掩码自编码目标。应用方差-协方差正则化器来稳定特征学习并提高表示多样性。通过自监督重建和模态插补在约60,000个多中心MRI上进行训练。

Result: 初步结果显示该方法在脑肿瘤和多发性硬化分割以及病变分类任务中表现可行，能够适应不同的模态设置。

Conclusion: 该模型消除了为每种模态训练单独模型的需求，能够在某些序列缺失或未见时自适应调整。代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different
combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable
modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding
objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance
regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation
diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality
and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It
is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised
reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A
learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can
adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor
and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under
various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works
feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more
detail. All code and pretrained models are available at
https://github.com/BrainFM/brainfm

### [9] [SLIP: Structural-aware Language-Image Pretraining for Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03019)
*Wenbo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIP提出了一种结构感知的语言-图像预训练方法，通过整合结构对比损失来对齐模态并建模结构化图中的实体关系，在跨模态检索和分类任务中优于CLIP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLP方法将图像-文本对视为孤立训练样本，忽略了自然存在于许多领域（如电商产品共购图、社交推荐网络）中的丰富关系结构。受神经科学证据启发，人类将知识编码为关系认知图。

Method: 引入结构感知语言-图像预训练(SLIP)，整合结构对比损失来对齐模态，同时建模结构化图中相邻实体之间的关系。构建了大规模亚马逊产品共购多模态图数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，SLIP在零样本和少样本设置下，在跨模态检索和分类任务中始终优于CLIP。

Conclusion: 关系监督对跨模态对齐具有重要价值，结构化方法能够显著提升VLP性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across
various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on
training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated
training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally
present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and
social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human
encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware
Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive
loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring
entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a
large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling
structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that
SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification
tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational
supervision for cross-modal alignment.

### [10] [From Propagation to Prediction: Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of MLS Point Clouds under Limited Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03053)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的移动激光扫描点云不确定性评估框架，无需地面真值，通过最优邻域估计和几何特征提取来预测点级不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Scan-to-BIM、变形分析和3D建模等高精度应用中，评估移动激光扫描点云的不确定性至关重要，但获取地面真值成本高昂且在实际应用中往往不可行。

Method: 开发了一个学习框架，结合最优邻域估计和几何特征提取，使用XGBoost模型预测点级不确定性（通过C2C距离量化）。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该框架可行，XGBoost模型在保持与随机森林相当精度的同时，效率显著提高（约快3倍）。

Conclusion: 研究表明移动激光扫描点云的不确定性是可学习的，为不确定性评估研究提供了新的基于学习的视角。

Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning
(MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM,
deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT)
for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications.
To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research,
this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that
integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction.
Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is
feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random
Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster),
providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict
point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study
shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel
learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

### [11] [A Plug-and-Play Framework for Volumetric Light-Sheet Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03093)
*Yi Gong,Xinyuan Zhang,Jichen Chai,Yichen Ding,Yifei Lou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合压缩感知和光片显微镜的高性能计算成像框架，用于高效、低光毒性的心脏成像，通过压缩采集和PnP重建算法在斑马鱼心脏上实现高质量动态结构重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光学成像在捕捉跳动心脏的动态细胞结构时存在时空分辨率权衡的局限性，需要克服这些限制以实现高速、低光毒性的心脏成像。

Method: 集成压缩感知与光片显微镜，使用DMD进行随机二元掩模编码压缩采集，提出PnP框架结合ADMM求解，灵活整合Tikhonov、TV和BM3D等先进去噪器，并引入时间正则化保持结构连续性。

Result: 在斑马鱼心脏高压缩比成像实验中，该方法成功重建细胞结构，具有优异的去噪性能和图像清晰度。

Conclusion: 验证了该算法在真实世界高速、低光生物成像场景中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cardiac contraction is a rapid, coordinated process that unfolds across
three-dimensional tissue on millisecond timescales. Traditional optical imaging
is often inadequate for capturing dynamic cellular structure in the beating
heart because of a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-performance
computational imaging framework that integrates Compressive Sensing (CS) with
Light-Sheet Microscopy (LSM) for efficient, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging. The
system performs compressed acquisition of fluorescence signals via random
binary mask coding using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). We propose a
Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, solved using the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly incorporates advanced denoisers, including
Tikhonov, Total Variation (TV), and BM3D. To preserve structural continuity in
dynamic imaging, we further introduce temporal regularization enforcing
smoothness between adjacent z-slices. Experimental results on zebrafish heart
imaging under high compression ratios demonstrate that the proposed method
successfully reconstructs cellular structures with excellent denoising
performance and image clarity, validating the effectiveness and robustness of
our algorithm in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.

### [12] [ISC-Perception: A Hybrid Computer Vision Dataset for Object Detection in Novel Steel Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03098)
*Miftahur Rahman,Samuel Adebayo,Dorian A. Acevedo-Mejia,David Hester,Daniel McPolin,Karen Rafferty,Debra F. Laefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ISC-Perception数据集，这是首个专门用于ISC组件检测的混合数据集，结合了CAD渲染图像、游戏引擎照片级真实场景和少量真实照片，显著降低了人工标注时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决建筑工地机器人感知中缺乏专用图像数据集的问题，因为在实际工地收集照片存在物流困难、安全和隐私问题。

Method: 创建混合数据集，包含程序化渲染的CAD图像、游戏引擎生成的逼真场景和少量精选真实照片，实现合成部分的完全自动标注。

Result: 生成10,000张图像数据集的人工时间仅为30.5小时，相比手动标注的166.7小时减少了81.7%；在ISC组件检测任务上达到0.756的mAP@0.50，显著优于仅使用合成或逼真数据的模型。

Conclusion: ISC-Perception填补了建筑机器人感知领域的数据空白，促进了定制物体检测器的快速开发，可免费用于研究和工业用途。

Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic
manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by
eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages
for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated
image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is
logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we
introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC
component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine
photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling
fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for
all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene
setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total
human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for
manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative
image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring
the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean
Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained
on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we
report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for
construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development
of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial
use upon request.

### [13] [DentalSplat: Dental Occlusion Novel View Synthesis from Sparse Intra-Oral Photographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03099)
*Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Tong Chen,Sihao Li,Ji Jiang,Youpeng Yang,Angelos Stefanidis,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentalSplat是一个从稀疏正畸图像进行3D重建的有效框架，通过先验引导的密集立体重建初始化点云，结合尺度自适应剪枝策略和光学流几何约束，在极稀疏视角下实现高质量的新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在正畸治疗特别是远程医疗中，从多视角观察患者牙颌关系有助于及时临床决策。传统3DGS方法需要密集多视角输入和精确相机位姿，而正畸案例通常只有前视图和双侧颊视图三个稀疏图像，使得重建任务极具挑战性。

Method: 1. 使用先验引导的密集立体重建模型初始化点云；2. 采用尺度自适应剪枝策略提高3DGS训练效率和重建质量；3. 在极稀疏视角下，结合光学流作为几何约束和梯度正则化来增强渲染保真度。

Result: 在包含950个临床案例的大规模数据集和195个模拟真实远程正畸成像条件的视频测试集上验证，实验结果表明该方法能有效处理稀疏输入场景，在牙颌可视化新视角合成质量上优于现有最先进技术。

Conclusion: DentalSplat框架成功解决了从稀疏正畸图像进行3D重建的挑战，为远程正畸治疗提供了有效的牙颌可视化解决方案。

Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

*Botong. Zhao,Xubin. Wang,Shujing. Lyu,Yue. Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IC DefectNCD框架，利用IC SEM图像的内在先验进行缺陷检测和新类别发现，无需支持集，在真实数据集上验证了稳健性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成电路制造过程复杂，缺陷可能出现在任何阶段，导致良率损失和产品可靠性下降。监督方法需要大量人工标注且难以处理新类别和罕见缺陷，基于聚类的方法由于缺乏先验而性能不稳定。

Method: 1. 自归一化信息引导的IC缺陷检测：通过可学习的正常信息提取器聚合代表性正常特征，使用重建残差粗略定位缺陷区域；2. 自适应二值化策略处理缺陷显著性变化；3. 自缺陷信息引导的IC缺陷分类：使用软掩码引导的注意力机制将空间缺陷先验注入师生模型。

Result: 在涵盖三个关键制造阶段和15种缺陷类型的真实世界数据集上验证，实验表明在缺陷检测和未见缺陷分类方面均表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: IC DefectNCD框架有效解决了IC制造中缺陷检测和新类别发现的挑战，无需支持集，在真实场景中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication
stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance
on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

### [15] [Accelerating Physical Property Reasoning for Augmented Visual Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03126)
*Hongbo Lan,Zhenlin An,Haoyu Li,Vaibhav Singh,Longfei Shangguan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: \sysname系统通过算法和系统优化，将视觉引导的物理属性推理延迟从10-20分钟降低到6秒以内，实现了62.9-287.2倍加速，同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速视觉引导的物理属性推理，实现增强视觉认知，特别是在智能眼镜等实时应用中减少延迟。

Method: 采用快速几何3D重建、高效语义特征融合和并行视图编码等算法和系统优化方法。

Result: 在ABO数据集上达到62.9-287.2倍加速，物理属性估计准确率相当或更好，材料分割和体素级推理性能优于SOTA基线。在真实IKEA环境中结合眼动追踪，即使在较少视图下也能提供鲁棒的属性估计。

Conclusion: \sysname通过系统优化显著加速了物理属性推理，为智能眼镜等实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

### [16] [Deploying Rapid Damage Assessments from sUAS Imagery for Disaster Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03132)
*Thomas Manzini,Priyankari Perali,Robin R. Murphy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首个用于无人机图像中建筑物损伤评估的AI/ML系统，已在飓风灾害中实际部署使用，解决了灾害响应中的图像处理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾害响应中无人机团队每天产生大量图像数据（47GB-369GB），传统人工评估无法及时处理，延误救援响应。需要自动化系统来解决这一数据洪流问题。

Method: 基于最大已知的灾后无人机图像数据集（包含21,716个建筑物损伤标签）训练模型，并对91名灾害从业人员进行操作培训。

Result: 在飓风Debby和Helene响应期间部署最佳模型，在约18分钟内评估了415栋建筑物。

Conclusion: 这项工作记录了AI/ML在灾害期间用于损伤评估的实际应用，为AI/ML研究和用户社区提供了宝贵的经验教训。

Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage
assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed
operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and
Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect
imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,
teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,
representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by
subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.
To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and
machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed
to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state
of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has
been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice
via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment
with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known
dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage
labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best
performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and
Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.
This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage
assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML
research and user communities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需微调的个性化文本到图像生成方法，使用超网络直接从主题图像预测LoRA权重，避免了传统方法的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化方法如DreamBooth需要针对每个主题进行微调，计算成本高且推理速度慢。现有适配器方法仍需额外微调或依赖大型骨干模型。

Method: 使用超网络直接从主题图像预测LoRA权重，采用端到端训练目标和输出正则化稳定训练，并引入混合模型分类器自由引导(HM-CFG)增强组合泛化能力。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ、AFHQ-v2和DreamBench上的实验表明，该方法实现了强大的个性化性能，同时保持主题保真度和提示对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了超网络作为可扩展和有效的开放类别个性化方向的潜力，无需每个主题的优化即可实现高质量个性化生成。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

*Yun-Chen Lin,Jiayuan Huang,Hanyuan Zhang,Sergi Kavtaradze,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于腹腔镜肝脏手术中肝脏标志物分割的深度引导框架，通过结合RGB和深度特征，使用SRFT-GaLore高效微调SAM2编码器，在L3D数据集上显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在腹腔镜肝脏手术中，2D视频流限制了深度感知，使解剖标志物定位复杂化。现有方法在融合RGB和深度特征以及高效适应大规模视觉模型方面仍存在挑战。

Method: 使用SAM2编码器提取RGB特征，DA2编码器提取深度感知特征，引入SRFT-GaLore低秩梯度投影方法替代计算昂贵的SVD，通过交叉注意力融合模块整合RGB和深度线索。

Result: 在L3D数据集上，Dice相似系数提升4.85%，平均对称表面距离降低11.78点；在新建的LLSD数据集上保持竞争力，显著优于SAM基线方法。

Conclusion: SRFT-GaLore增强的双编码器框架能够在实时、深度受限的手术设置下实现可扩展且精确的分割，展示了强大的跨数据集鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical
imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in
laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and
complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular
depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and
depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to
surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation
framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation
encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB
features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.
To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient
projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a
Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient
fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing
representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB
and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new
Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.
On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice
Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface
Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,
we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive
performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating
strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical
environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced
dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under
real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

TL;DR: 提出了首个面向手术预判的视觉问答数据集PitVQA-Anticipation和SurgAnt-ViVQA模型，通过时序建模实现从回顾性描述到前瞻性预测的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在经鼻蝶垂体手术中，由于视野受限和工作流程快速变化，预测未来手术事件对实时辅助至关重要。现有VQA系统主要关注当前场景，缺乏对未来步骤的预测能力。

Method: 提出SurgAnt-ViVQA模型，使用GRU门控时序交叉注意力模块，通过双向GRU编码帧间动态，自适应门控在token级别注入视觉上下文，并采用参数高效微调定制语言骨干网络。

Result: 在PitVQA-Anticipation和EndoVis数据集上测试，超越了基于图像和视频的基线方法。消融实验显示时序循环和门控融合带来主要性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过结合时序感知编码器和细粒度门控交叉注意力，SurgAnt-ViVQA将手术VQA从回顾性描述推进到主动预判，PitVQA-Anticipation为该领域提供了全面基准。

Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in
endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and
workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason
on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little
support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA
datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We
introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward
looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and
734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert
annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming
instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video
language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal
Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,
while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the
token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone
to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and
EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations
show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame
budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32
frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a
temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA
advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.
PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and
highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future
aware surgical assistance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QG-CoC方法解决多模态大语言模型在多图像场景下的细粒度感知和推理能力不足问题，该方法通过问题引导的标题链实现零样本提示，在多种基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在多图像场景中存在两个关键问题：(1)缺乏对分散图像的细粒度感知能力，(2)在多视觉输入上进行有效推理和信息整合的能力下降。现有研究主要关注单图像或特定受限场景，缺乏对复杂多图像推理任务的深入理解。

Method: 提出QG-CoC（问题引导的标题链）零样本提示方法，这是一种通用的提示方法，能够有效处理任意数量图像的问题。该方法通过问题引导生成图像标题链，实现感知与推理的无缝集成。

Result: 在开源和闭源多模态大语言模型上的多图像和单图像基准测试表明，QG-CoC在各种任务中表现出竞争力，在现有提示方法失败的挑战性场景中展现出稳健的改进。

Conclusion: QG-CoC是一种有效的零样本提示方法，能够显著提升多模态大语言模型在多图像场景中的感知和推理能力，特别是在复杂和挑战性任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

Motivation: 在医疗资源有限的环境中，现有剖腹产风险预测模型依赖医院内参数，无法在家庭或资源受限环境中使用，需要开发更易获取的预测方法。

Method: 提出多视图Transformer网络MvBody，结合自报医疗数据和3D光学身体扫描，使用度量学习损失提高训练效率和泛化能力。

Result: 在独立测试集上达到84.62%准确率和0.724 AUC-ROC，优于现有机器学习模型和3D分析方法。

Conclusion: 孕前体重、母亲年龄、产科史、既往剖腹产史以及头肩部身体形态是剖腹产风险预测的关键因素，3D身体扫描可作为资源有限环境下的可行预测工具。

Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合扩散合成和样本混合的数据增强方法MCPMix，通过生成与真实图像共享相同掩码的合成图像对，进行掩码一致的配对混合，同时使用RLA自适应调整混合强度和损失权重，在多个医学图像分割数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据增强方法存在局限性：样本混合会产生软标签模糊问题，而扩散合成虽然增加多样性但忽略了掩码条件化的结构优势并引入合成-真实域偏移。需要融合两种方法的优势来解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 为每个真实图像生成相同掩码下的合成对应图像；2. 使用MCPMix进行掩码一致的配对混合，仅混合图像外观而保持原始硬掩码监督；3. 采用RLA自适应调整混合强度和混合样本的损失权重，逐步重新锚定到真实数据。

Result: 在Kvasir-SEG、PICCOLO、CVC-ClinicDB、私有NPC-LES队列和ISIC 2017等多个数据集上实现了最先进的分割性能，相比基线方法获得了一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合标签保持的混合与扩散驱动的多样性，配合自适应重新锚定，能够产生鲁棒且可泛化的内窥镜分割结果。

Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or
generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield
soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,
when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask
conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,
diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real
image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is
used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which
mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard
mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly
bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging
diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned
with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the
mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually
re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.
Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC
2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and
consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining
label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive
re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有的Mamba-based超分辨率方法在不同建模尺度之间缺乏细粒度过渡，限制了特征表示的效率。

Method: 集成窗口自注意力与渐进式Mamba，建立多尺度感受野交互的细粒度建模范式；引入自适应高频细化模块(AHFRM)来恢复Transformer和Mamba处理过程中丢失的高频细节。

Result: 实验表明T-PMambaSR能渐进增强模型的感受野和表达能力，在较低计算成本下比最近的Transformer或Mamba方法获得更好性能。

Conclusion: T-PMambaSR通过结合窗口自注意力和渐进式Mamba，实现了高效的细粒度建模，在超分辨率任务中取得了优越的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the
ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing
the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However,
existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different
modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this
paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates
window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions
among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a
fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature
representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive
High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost
during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and
expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or
Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be
released after acceptance.

Conclusion: DMPO在架构设计和模型优化方面有效解耦了早期阶段的表征和判别能力

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model
tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical
deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when
cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a
straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key
challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level
fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level
discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we
propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively
decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative
ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a
lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional
decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order
statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance
their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor
architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss
weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial
training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of
discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of
early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability
towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively
decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms
of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various
datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms
its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and
interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and
missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge
because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several
sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often
imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but
is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a
generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on
54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise,
adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for
reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic
ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground
truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real
ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded
clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice
score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician
accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%),
indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos,
the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average
SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data
expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset
design toolbox for medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在实用计算预算下难以同时实现高效的全局上下文建模和长距离依赖推理，特别是在医学图像分割任务中。

Method: 结合Mamba状态空间模块进行高效长距离推理，在瓶颈层使用热传导算子模拟频域热扩散以增强语义抽象能力。

Result: 在多模态腹部CT和MRI数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型持续优于强基线方法，验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将状态空间动力学与基于热传导的全局扩散相结合，为医学分割任务提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced by deep learning
architectures, notably U-Net variants. However, existing models struggle to
achieve efficient global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning
under practical computational budgets simultaneously. In this work, we propose
a novel hybrid architecture utilizing U-Mamba with Heat Conduction Equation.
Our model combines Mamba-based state-space modules for efficient long-range
reasoning with Heat Conduction Operators (HCOs) in the bottleneck layers,
simulating frequency-domain thermal diffusion for enhanced semantic
abstraction. Experimental results on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms strong baselines,
validating its effectiveness and generalizability. It suggest that blending
state-space dynamics with heat-based global diffusion offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for medical segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了针对工业设备组件的3D异常检测数据集IEC3D-AD和新方法GMANet，通过几何形态分析生成合成点云样本，并通过空间差异优化提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D数据集无法捕捉真实工业环境中的复杂性和细微缺陷，限制了工业设备组件（如轴承、环、螺栓）的精确异常检测研究。

Method: 开发了IEC3D-AD数据集，并提出GMANet方法：基于几何形态分析生成合成点云样本，通过空间差异优化减少正常与异常点级特征之间的差距并增加重叠度。

Result: 在IEC3D-AD和其他数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IEC3D-AD数据集和GMANet方法为工业设备组件的3D异常检测提供了更精确的解决方案，能够更好地适应真实工业场景的需求。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

*Shuangquan Lyu,Steven Mao,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LoRA微调和重叠混合时间协同去噪策略的统一方法，用于实现任意长度视频的高质量修复和外扩，解决了长视频生成中的可控性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频生成中的根本挑战，特别是视频修复和外扩的高可控性需求，同时处理这两个问题以实现对长视频片段的可控编辑。

Method: 利用LoRA高效微调预训练视频扩散模型（如Wan 2.1）进行掩码区域视频合成，采用重叠混合时间协同去噪策略和高阶求解器保持长序列一致性。

Result: 在包含数百帧的对象编辑和添加等挑战性任务上验证，在质量指标（PSNR/SSIM）和感知真实性（LPIPS）上优于基线方法Wan 2.1和VACE。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了参数效率与卓越性能的平衡，以最小开销实现实用的长范围视频编辑，消除了固定长度片段限制和拼接伪影问题。

Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on
challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects
over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline
methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and
perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video
editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient
and superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Diffusion-SDPO方法，解决了扩散模型直接偏好优化中的关键问题：扩大偏好边界反而可能降低生成质量。新方法通过自适应缩放失败者梯度来保护获胜者，确保偏好输出质量不下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型的直接偏好优化方法存在病理性问题，扩大偏好边界不一定能提高生成质量，反而可能同时增加获胜者和失败者的重构误差，导致偏好分支也受到负面影响。

Method: 提出Diffusion-SDPO方法，采用保护性更新规则，根据失败者梯度与获胜者梯度的对齐程度自适应缩放失败者梯度，通过一阶分析得到闭式缩放系数，确保偏好输出的误差在每一步优化中不增加。

Result: 在标准文本到图像基准测试中，Diffusion-SDPO在自动化偏好、美学和提示对齐指标上相比现有偏好学习基线方法取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: Diffusion-SDPO是一种简单、模型无关的方法，与现有DPO风格对齐框架广泛兼容，仅增加少量计算开销，能有效解决扩散模型偏好优化中的关键问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them
with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical
pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve
generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can
increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.
Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently
severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin
grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule
that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to
its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a
closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred
output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,
model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks
and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image
benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning
baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

TL;DR: SurgViVQA是一个外科视频问答模型，通过融合视频和问题特征来捕捉时间线索，在结肠镜视频问答任务中显著优于现有图像基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前外科视频问答方法局限于静态图像特征，缺乏对时间动态的建模，而手术过程中的运动和组织-工具交互等时间线索对于准确理解手术过程至关重要。

Method: 提出SurgViVQA模型，使用掩码视频-文本编码器融合视频和问题特征，捕捉运动和组织-工具交互等时间线索，然后通过微调的大型语言模型解码生成连贯答案。

Result: 在REAL-Colon-VQA和EndoVis18-VQA数据集上的实验表明，SurgViVQA在关键词准确率上比PitVQA分别提升11%和9%，扰动研究证实了模型对问题表述变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SurgViVQA和REAL-Colon-VQA数据集为外科视频问答提供了时间感知理解的框架，使AI模型能更有效地解释动态手术场景。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance
intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally
coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to
static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,
ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We
propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from
static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder
to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and
tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then
decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated
REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related
questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with
rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.
Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset
shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,
particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on
REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions
further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in
question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework
for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to
interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively. Code and dataset

TL;DR: UniAVGen是一个统一的音频-视频联合生成框架，通过双分支扩散变换器架构和跨模态交互机制，解决了现有方法在唇形同步和语义一致性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源音频-视频生成方法由于缺乏有效的跨模态建模，常常表现出唇形同步不佳和语义一致性不足的问题。

Method: 采用双分支联合合成架构，包含两个并行扩散变换器构建统一的跨模态潜在空间；核心是异步跨模态交互机制，实现双向、时间对齐的跨注意力；通过面部感知调制模块动态优先处理显著区域；引入模态感知无分类器引导策略增强跨模态相关性。

Result: 在训练样本大幅减少的情况下（130万vs3010万），UniAVGen在音频-视频同步、音色一致性和情感一致性方面展现出整体优势。

Conclusion: UniAVGen的鲁棒联合合成设计能够在一个模型中无缝统一关键的音频-视频任务，包括联合音频-视频生成和延续、视频到音频配音以及音频驱动的视频合成。

Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source
audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization
and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose
UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is
anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two
parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent
space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which
enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring
precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,
this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,
which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To
enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce
Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly
amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint
synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks
within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,
video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive
experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),
UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre
consistency, and emotion consistency.

TL;DR: 提出AAPL方法，通过引入对抗性token嵌入来解耦图像增强引入的表面视觉变化与类别相关语义表示，从而提升提示学习在零样本学习中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法主要关注文本修改，忽略了图像增强的潜力，且在完全未见类别上泛化能力不足。传统零样本学习受益于数据增强策略，但提示学习在这方面探索不足。

Method: AAPL方法引入对抗性token嵌入，解耦图像增强带来的表面视觉变化与类别语义表示，使学习到的提示能够专注于与目标类别对齐的视觉判别特征。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上的实验表明，AAPL在少样本、零样本、跨数据集和领域泛化设置中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 图像级增强特别是属性特定变化可以有效支持提示学习，AAPL通过解耦策略显著提升了提示学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to
significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and
CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,
known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these
models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While
traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data
augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based
modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely
unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,
particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support
and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between
these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to
improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such
as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that
focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose
Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces
adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations
introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This
decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually
discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently
outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and
domain generalization settings. Our source code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 标准化胚胎在3D超声图像中的对齐有助于产前生长监测，促进标准平面检测，改善标志物可视化，并突出不同扫描之间的差异。

Method: 使用胚胎分割掩模进行PCA分析提取主轴，生成四个候选方向，然后通过三种策略选择标准方向：基于皮尔逊相关的启发式方法、与图谱的图像匹配、随机森林分类器。

Result: 在2166张图像中，PCA正确提取胚胎主轴的比例为99.0%，三种选择方法的准确率分别为97.4%、95.8%和98.4%，多数投票达到98.5%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该管道的高准确性使得在孕早期能够实现一致的胚胎对齐，为临床和研究环境中的可扩展分析提供了可能。

Abstract: Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,
95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection
methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline
enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling
scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings. The code is publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的形状模板重建方法在遇到拓扑变化时会失效，无法处理撕裂、切割等实际应用中常见的拓扑事件。

Method: 基于经典SfT解初始化，通过迭代分区模板空间，最小化结合物理合理性和重投影一致性的能量函数。

Result: 方法能够稳健地捕捉各种实际相关的拓扑事件，在合成和真实数据实验中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 建立了首个通用的拓扑变化感知SfT框架，为处理拓扑变化的表面重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing the surfaces of deformable objects from correspondences
between a 3D template and a 2D image is well studied under Shape-from-Template
(SfT) methods; however, existing approaches break down when topological changes
accompany the deformation. We propose a principled extension of SfT that
enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is
initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template
by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that
jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We
demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically
relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces,
thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware
SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach
consistently outperforms baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型依赖昂贵的3D扫描和专有技术，且人口统计代表性不足，需要开发一个开放、可解释且具有广泛人口代表性的模型。

Method: 基于MakeHuman社区的人体测量学知识，构建连续可解释的形状空间，使用表型参数（性别、年龄、身高、体重）控制混合形状，并通过WHO人口统计数据校准。

Result: Anny模型能够生成真实且具有人口统计基础的人体形状变化，Anny-One数据集包含80万张照片级真实感人体图像，训练的人体网格恢复模型性能可与基于扫描的模型相媲美。

Conclusion: Anny作为一个简单、开放且语义可控的人体模型，为3D人体建模提供了可访问的基础，其Apache 2.0许可证确保了广泛的可访问性。

Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing
models often rely on costly 3D scans and learned shape spaces that are
proprietary and demographically narrow. We introduce Anny, a simple, fully
differentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric
knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,
interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,
height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --
across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated
using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically
grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its
openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D
human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled
synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce
Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,
showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the
performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining
interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are
released under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for

*Vittal L. Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种信号强度加权的坐标表示方法，用局部信号强度缩放的坐标通道替代纯坐标通道，在ECG信号和细胞图像定位任务中表现优于传统坐标通道方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据中的定位任务需要模型从具有复杂强度分布的信号中学习有意义的空间或时间关系，传统方法如CoordConv层通过附加坐标通道来学习绝对位置，但缺乏信号强度与位置的耦合信息。

Method: 提出信号强度加权的坐标表示，将纯坐标通道替换为通过局部信号强度缩放的坐标通道，直接在输入表示中嵌入强度-位置耦合，这是一种简单且模态无关的归纳偏置。

Result: 在ECG信号形态转换时间预测和细胞核中心坐标回归两个定位任务中，该方法相比传统坐标通道方法实现了更快的收敛速度和更高的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 信号强度加权的坐标表示在一维和二维生物医学信号定位任务中都表现出有效性，能够提高模型性能。

Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn
meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex
intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is
to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to
learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted
coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with
channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an
intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a
simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two
distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological
transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the
coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.
In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher
generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel
approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional biomedical signals.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based
deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human
action recognition systems suitable for real-world edge applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于身体部位感知的自下而上群体推理框架，用于细粒度社交互动检测，通过分析身体部位特征和人际关系来推断社交群体及其互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社交互动检测方法忽略了细微的面部表情、注视和手势等线索，主要依赖个体整体表征，且直接检测社交群体而不显式建模个体间互动，限制了捕捉局部社交信号的能力。

Method: 首先检测个体并使用部位感知线索增强其特征，然后通过基于相似性的推理关联个体来推断群体配置，考虑空间关系和细微社交线索。

Result: 在NVI数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 提出的部位感知自下而上群体推理框架能够更准确地检测细粒度社交互动，通过显式建模个体间互动和利用细微社交线索来改进群体推断。

Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
methods, achieving the new state of the art.

TL;DR: DANCE是一个可解释的视频动作识别框架，通过解耦运动动态、物体和场景概念来提供清晰的解释，在保持竞争力的同时显著提升了解释的清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于显著性的方法产生纠缠的解释，无法区分预测是依赖运动还是空间上下文；基于语言的方法由于运动的隐含性（直觉理解但难以言表）往往无法解释运动。

Method: 提出DANCE框架，通过解耦的概念类型（运动动态、物体、场景）预测动作，将运动动态概念定义为人体姿态序列，使用大语言模型自动提取物体和场景概念，基于前概念瓶颈设计强制通过这些概念进行预测。

Result: 在四个数据集（KTH、Penn Action、HAA500、UCF-101）上的实验表明，DANCE在保持竞争力的同时显著提高了解释清晰度，用户研究验证了其优越的可解释性。

Conclusion: DANCE不仅提高了视频动作识别的可解释性，还对模型调试、编辑和故障分析有益。

Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle
how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,
existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it
unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based
approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit
nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these
challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based
Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions
through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We
define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large
language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an
ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these
concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101
-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with
competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE
through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial
for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了AI控制协议在多样化智能体环境中的安全性和鲁棒性，发现关键行动延迟策略对最强红队攻击具有高度鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统作为智能体被广泛部署，确保其安全运行变得至关重要。AI控制通过监控智能体行动并在必要时干预或审计来降低不可信AI的风险。

Method: 在SHADE-Arena多样化智能体环境数据集中评估控制协议，包括可信模型延迟、重采样和关键行动延迟等蓝队协议，并迭代开发红队攻击策略。

Result: 重采样和关键行动延迟协议将安全性从50%提升至96%，但具有额外能力的红队攻击可将重采样策略的安全性降至17%。关键行动延迟策略对最强红队攻击保持高度鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 关键行动延迟策略对自适应攻击具有高度鲁棒性，表明拒绝攻击策略访问协议内部信息对于AI控制安全至关重要。

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed as agents, ensuring
their safe operation becomes critical. AI control offers one approach to
mitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and
intervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these
protocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current
attacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we
systematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset
of diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols,
including deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical
actions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for
incrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety
from 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols
and find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of
when resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially
improve attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety
to 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our
strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack
policies access to protocol internals.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PublicAgent是一个多智能体框架，通过将端到端数据分析工作流分解为专门的智能体（意图澄清、数据集发现、分析和报告），解决了LLM在复杂分析任务中的注意力稀释、推理模式干扰和错误传播问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放数据仓库具有基于证据决策的潜力，但非专家缺乏数据集发现、模式映射和统计分析的专业知识。虽然大语言模型在单个任务上表现良好，但在端到端分析工作流中暴露出根本性限制。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，将分析流程分解为专门的智能体：意图澄清、数据集发现、分析和报告。这种架构在每个阶段保持专注的注意力并实现验证。

Result: 评估显示：1) 专业化独立于模型强度带来价值；2) 智能体分为通用型（发现、分析）和条件型（报告、意图）；3) 不同智能体缓解不同的失败模式；4) 架构优势在不同任务复杂度下持续存在；5) 智能体有效性在不同模型间差异显著。

Conclusion: 这些原则指导了在复杂分析工作流中何时以及为何需要专业化，同时通过自然语言接口实现更广泛的公共数据访问。

Abstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet
are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema
mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for
individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental
limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning
patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a
multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition
into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,
and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent
contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models
and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.
First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the
strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model
scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and
conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent
effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev
20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or
analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing
report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits
persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%
discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning
enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%
for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide
when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while
enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型作为评估者对于构建可扩展和可信赖的评估流程日益重要，需要系统性的比较研究。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，通过可扩展的多数投票将模式审计和问题代码聚合成真实标签，无需人工标注即可进行可重现的LLM评估者比较。

Result: 在互补商品推荐任务中，Claude 3.5 Sonnet决策置信度最高；Gemini 1.5 Pro跨类别表现最佳；GPT-4o在延迟-准确性-成本权衡最优；GPT-OSS 20B在开源模型中领先。结构化领域（电子、体育）共识强，生活方式类别（服装、食品）存在持续分歧。

Conclusion: ScalingEval为LLM作为评估者建立了可重现的基准和评估协议，提供了关于扩展性、可靠性和模型家族权衡的可操作指导。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as judges is increasingly critical
for building scalable and trustworthy evaluation pipelines. We present
ScalingEval, a large-scale benchmarking study that systematically compares 36
LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, across multiple product
categories using a consensus-driven evaluation protocol. Our multi-agent
framework aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels
via scalable majority voting, enabling reproducible comparison of LLM
evaluators without human annotation. Applied to large-scale complementary-item
recommendation, the benchmark reports four key findings: (i) Anthropic Claude
3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro offers
the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most
favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among
open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in
structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in
lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges, with
actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.

TL;DR: 构建首个基准测试来评估LLMs是否内化了描述现实世界概率分布的知识，结果显示LLMs整体表现不佳，未能自然内化现实世界统计数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在科学领域有巨大潜力，但需要更通用的智能能力。关键区别在于事实性知识和概率性知识，LLMs被宣传为现实世界分布的强大通用逼近器，但统计学中的维度灾难理论挑战了这种普遍分布学习的可能性。

Method: 开发首个基准测试，直接评估LLMs是否能够获取描述现实世界人口的经验分布，涵盖经济、健康、教育和社会行为等领域。

Result: LLMs整体表现不佳，似乎没有自然内化现实世界统计数据。在Pearl因果层次框架下，语言模型不包含观测分布知识（PCH第一层）。

Conclusion: 语言模型在获取现实世界概率分布知识方面能力有限，根据因果层次定理，这意味着它们在干预性（第二层）和反事实性（第三层）知识方面也受到限制。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various
scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications.
Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order
to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this
context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or
false answers (e.g., "what is the capital of England?"), and probabilistic
knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., "what
is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?"). In this paper, our goal
is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of
knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that
LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they
internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful
universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,
classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight
fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,
challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we
develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating
whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world
populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social
behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not
seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the
context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that
language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer
1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional
(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also
limited.

TL;DR: SnapStream是一种KV缓存压缩方法，可在保持模型精度的同时显著减少内存使用，已在生产环境中部署验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型参数和上下文长度的增加，KV缓存对内存的需求急剧上升，但现有压缩技术难以在工业框架中部署且对现代模型精度影响不明确。

Method: 开发SnapStream KV缓存压缩方法，在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和DeepSeek-R1上进行精度影响研究，并在SambaNova SN40L加速器上实现16路张量并行部署。

Result: SnapStream实现了4倍内存使用改进，在128k上下文长度下达到1832 tokens/秒，在LongBench-v2、AIME24和LiveCodeBench上引入最小精度损失。

Conclusion: SnapStream是首个在静态图和连续批处理生产推理系统中部署的稀疏KV注意力技术，为大规模LLM部署提供了可行的内存优化方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+
context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory
to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV
demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet,
these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using
frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static
graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it
difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention
algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such
techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well
understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this
paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be
deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way
tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators
running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real
production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage
and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and
LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation
of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system
with static graphs and continuous batching.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于能力的监控作为医疗领域大语言模型监控的新组织原则，替代传统的基于任务的监控方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于任务的监控方法假设模型性能会因数据集漂移而下降，但大语言模型并非针对特定任务训练，这种假设不成立。需要一种更符合大语言模型通用特性的监控方法。

Method: 基于能力的监控围绕共享模型能力（如摘要、推理、翻译、安全防护）组织监控，而非独立评估每个下游任务，从而能够跨任务检测系统性弱点、长尾错误和涌现行为。

Result: 该方法为医疗领域大语言模型和未来通用人工智能模型提供了可扩展、安全、自适应和协作的监控基础。

Conclusion: 基于能力的监控是监控医疗领域大语言模型和未来通用AI模型的更有效方法，能够检测传统任务监控可能遗漏的问题。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches,
inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on
assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with
LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to
the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any
specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing
principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in
how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based
monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are
generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across
numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task
independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model
capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety
guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses,
long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss.
We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and
professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach.
Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for
safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist
artificial intelligence models in healthcare.

Motivation: 评估AI系统在数学奥林匹克竞赛中的表现，发现形式化与非形式化陈述之间的差异严重影响性能，需要改进基准测试质量。

Method: 对miniF2F基准进行全面分析，识别形式化与非形式化陈述的差异，修正所有错误和简化，创建miniF2F-v2版本。

Result: 在原始miniF2F上最佳准确率为36%，修正后的miniF2F-v2上达到70%准确率，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 高质量基准测试对评估形式推理进展至关重要，能更好诊断自动形式化和定理证明模型的失败与成功模式。

Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the formal and informal statements in the
miniF2F benchmark from the perspective of an AI system that is tasked to
participate in a math Olympiad consisting of the problems in miniF2F. In such
setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language,
formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it
will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the
original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results
reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA
models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA
accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving
literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion
of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for
more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the
errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,
and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements
and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to
the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the
original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the
autoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a
higher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the
field of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success
modes of autoformalization and theorem proving models. Our dataset is available
at https://github.com/roozbeh-yz/miniF2F_v2.

Abstract: As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements
in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant
importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily
manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and
other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order
methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient
information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are
ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the
rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial
improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.
Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language
models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we
choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel
approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large
language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical
Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further
utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the
multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific
tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic
design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs
generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on
many problem instances.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely
constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper
proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard
LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework
employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a
fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused
Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling
of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario
adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level,
the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a
specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are
grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates
information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly
higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the
baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk
test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score,
validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios.
This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building
high-security, high-trust LLM applications.

Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains,
leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional
methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,
we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework
that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces
specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine
design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the
aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of
three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems
Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.
The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical
requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer
leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose
candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and
provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge
graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the
manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics
such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how
collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can
enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.

*Yi-Fei Liu,Yi-Long Lu,Di He,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs能够仅基于大五人格量表数据，准确预测其他9个心理量表的相关结构，其生成结果与人类数据的相关性模式高度一致（R² > 0.89），超越了基于语义相似度的预测，接近直接在数据集上训练的机器学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能够从最小化的定量输入中建模人类心理特质的相关结构，探索其在心理模拟中的潜力以及其推理能力。

Method: 使用816名人类个体的大五人格量表数据提示各种LLMs，让它们模拟在其他9个心理量表上的回答，并分析其推理过程。

Result: LLMs在零样本条件下表现出色，能够准确捕捉人类心理结构，其两阶段推理过程包括：将原始大五反应转化为自然语言人格摘要，然后基于这些摘要推理生成目标量表回答。

Conclusion: LLMs通过抽象和推理过程能够从最小数据精确预测个体心理特质，为心理模拟提供了强大工具，并揭示了其新兴推理能力。

Abstract: Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be
interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)
can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from
minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality
Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine
other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing
human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from
LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >
0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on
semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms
trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that
LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five
responses into natural language personality summaries through information
selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.
Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these
summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality
factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item
importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely
redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to
original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,
second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs
can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from
minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a
powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their
emergent reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网站可访问性审计方法资源密集且难以规模化，大多数网站界面不符合标准，需要更高效的解决方案来促进数字空间的公平与包容。

Method: 开发了AAA框架，包含GRASP（基于图的多模态采样方法）和MaC（多模态大语言模型助手），通过人机协作模式实现端到端的Web可访问性审计。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，小规模语言模型经过微调后能够胜任专家角色，框架支持规模化审计并提升了效率。

Conclusion: AAA框架通过人机协作和AI增强辅助，为Web可访问性审计提供了可扩展的解决方案，有助于推动数字包容性。

Abstract: Ensuring web accessibility is crucial for advancing social welfare, justice,
and equality in digital spaces, yet the vast majority of website user
interfaces remain non-compliant, due in part to the resource-intensive and
unscalable nature of current auditing practices. While WCAG-EM offers a
structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great
human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work,
we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a
human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a
graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page
coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and
MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors
through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks.
Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility
auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world
impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking
core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language
models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation into the
parameterized complexity of explanation problems in various machine learning
(ML) models. Contrary to the prevalent black-box perception, our study focuses
on models with transparent internal mechanisms. We address two principal types
of explanation problems: abductive and contrastive, both in their local and
global variants. Our analysis encompasses diverse ML models, including Decision
Trees, Decision Sets, Decision Lists, Boolean Circuits, and ensembles thereof,
each offering unique explanatory challenges. This research fills a significant
gap in explainable AI (XAI) by providing a foundational understanding of the
complexities of generating explanations for these models. This work provides
insights vital for further research in the domain of XAI, contributing to the

Motivation: 虽然AI在德州扑克等游戏中取得了突破，但多人互动有限。Liar's Poker具有更丰富的多人互动特性，是测试AI在多人动态、不完美信息和不确定性推理能力的理想环境。

Method: 使用无模型、演员-评论家深度强化学习算法进行自对弈训练。

Result: Solly在胜率（超过50%）和收益方面达到精英人类水平，在单挑和多人游戏中都优于大型语言模型，开发了新颖的叫牌策略并有效随机化游戏。

Conclusion: Solly证明了深度强化学习可以在具有复杂多人互动的游戏中达到精英人类水平，为AI在不完美信息多人游戏中的发展提供了重要进展。

Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for
environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and
reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite
human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:
most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple
rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to
achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized
by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a
model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played
at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and
equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also
outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning
abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,
randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class
human players.

*Haotian Yin,Przemyslaw Musialski*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对神经符号距离函数(SDF)中Off-Diagonal Weingarten损失的自适应调度策略，通过动态调整正则化权重来平衡早期稳定性和后期细节恢复，在CAD重建任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FlatCAD中使用固定的ODW损失权重存在局限性：强正则化在早期优化中能稳定训练但会抑制后期细节恢复，需要一种自适应策略来平衡不同训练阶段的需求。

Method: 研究了多种ODW损失权重调度策略，包括常数、线性、五次方和阶梯插值调度，以及增加预热变体，通过动态调整正则化强度来优化训练过程。

Result: 在ABC CAD数据集上的实验表明，时间变化调度策略始终优于固定权重方法，Chamfer距离相比FlatCAD基线提升了35%。

Conclusion: ODW损失的时间调度是一个简单而有效的扩展，能够显著提升CAD重建的鲁棒性和精度。

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have become a powerful representation
for geometric reconstruction from point clouds, yet they often require both
gradient- and curvature-based regularization to suppress spurious warp and
preserve structural fidelity. FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten
(ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating
full-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However,
FlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal:
strong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail
recovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss
that assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively
decay it to permit fine-scale refinement. We investigate constant, linear,
quintic, and step interpolation schedules, as well as an increasing warm-up
variant. Experiments on the ABC CAD dataset demonstrate that time-varying
schedules consistently outperform fixed weights. Our method achieves up to a
35% improvement in Chamfer Distance over the FlatCAD baseline, establishing
scheduling as a simple yet effective extension of curvature regularization for
robust CAD reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估可视化如何影响MLLM对网络桥梁存在性的判断，探讨可视化在AI应用中的影响

Method: 比较可视化输入与结构化文本输入对MLLM判断的影响，分析标准可视化技术产生的偏见

Result: 可视化提高置信度但产生强烈偏见，无论桥梁是否实际存在都会影响MLLM接受或拒绝的判断

Conclusion: 可视化能有效影响MLLM判断而不损害其置信度，但实践中需谨慎使用以避免不良幻觉

Abstract: We evaluate how visualizations can influence the judgment of MLLMs about the
presence or absence of bridges in a network. We show that the inclusion of
visualization improves confidence over a structured text-based input that could
theoretically be helpful for answering the question. On the other hand, we
observe that standard visualization techniques create a strong bias towards
accepting or refuting the presence of a bridge -- independently of whether or
not a bridge actually exists in the network. While our results indicate that
the inclusion of visualization techniques can effectively influence the MLLM's
judgment without compromising its self-reported confidence, they also imply
that practitioners must be careful of allowing users to include visualizations
in generative AI applications so as to avoid undesired hallucinations.

TL;DR: FATE是一个新的形式代数定理评估基准系列，包含FATE-H和FATE-X各100个问题，难度从本科练习到超过博士资格考试水平，旨在评估大语言模型在高级数学推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在IMO等竞赛数学基准上表现出色，但这些基准无法反映现代数学研究的深度、广度和抽象性，因此需要新的基准来评估高级数学推理能力。

Method: 引入FATE基准系列，包含两个组件：FATE-H（抽象代数）和FATE-X（交换代数），每个组件100个问题，难度跨度大。采用两阶段评估方法，比较模型在自然语言推理和形式化推理方面的表现。

Result: 最先进的大语言模型在FATE基准上表现很差：FATE-H上最佳模型仅达到3%（pass@64）准确率，FATE-X上为0%。模型在自然语言推理阶段的准确性显著高于形式化推理阶段。

Conclusion: FATE提供了一个稳健且具有挑战性的基准，为研究级形式数学推理的发展路径建立了重要检查点，揭示了当前模型在高级数学推理方面的严重局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based
mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect
the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge
this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new
benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced
mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each
with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a
difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD
qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both
PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our
evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a
stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3%
(pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals
that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their
ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common
errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative
study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection
than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language
stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that
establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal
mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: DeepForm是一个用于动态群组推荐的框架，通过图卷积网络和随机聚类学习实现实时群组形成和动态调整


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的群组推荐系统主要关注推荐准确性，但假设群组是静态或预定义的，不适用于动态现实场景

Method: 使用轻量级GCN架构捕捉高阶用户信息，结合随机聚类学习实现自适应群组重构，对比学习优化动态条件下的群组质量

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，DeepForm在群组形成质量、效率和推荐准确性方面优于各种基线方法

Conclusion: DeepForm成功解决了动态群组形成的核心挑战，满足了实时性和自适应性的操作需求

Abstract: While prior work on group recommender systems (GRSs) has primarily focused on
improving recommendation accuracy, most approaches assume static or predefined
groups, making them unsuitable for dynamic, real-world scenarios. We reframe
group formation as a core challenge in GRSs and propose DeepForm (Stochastic
Deep Graph Clustering for Practical Group Formation), a framework designed to
meet three key operational requirements: (1) the incorporation of high-order
user information, (2) real-time group formation, and (3) dynamic adjustment of
the number of groups. DeepForm employs a lightweight GCN architecture that
effectively captures high-order structural signals. Stochastic cluster learning
enables adaptive group reconfiguration without retraining, while contrastive
learning refines groups under dynamic conditions. Experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that DeepForm achieves superior group formation quality,
efficiency, and recommendation accuracy compared with various baselines.

Motivation: 解决之前TRM方法计算成本过高的问题，在竞赛允许的计算限制内实现有效的模型训练

Method: 先预训练7M参数递归神经网络在1280个公共ARC任务上，然后在竞赛任务上进行全参数微调

Result: 预训练模型在公共评估集上获得约10%分数，竞赛微调后在半私有评估任务上达到6.67%分数

Conclusion: 通过预训练加高效微调的策略，可以在计算限制内实现有竞争力的ARC任务性能

Abstract: Prior to the close of the 2025 ARC Prize competition, the leading open source
approach - known as TRM, or Tiny Recursive Models - involved training a 7M
parameter recursive neural network on augmented variants of ARC tasks. That
approach scored approximately 7.8% on the public ARC AGI II evaluation set, but
required a level of compute far in excess of what is allowed during the
competition. This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model
that has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on
competition tasks within the allowed compute limits. Specifically, a model was
pre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on
4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model
was then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to
reach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks. Notably, such
post-training performance is achieved by full-fine tuning of the tiny model,
not LoRA fine-tuning or fine-tuning of task embeddings alone.

Conclusion: LLM能够为人类活动识别系统提供强大且适应性强的防御机制，减少对大规模数据集的依赖，提高系统安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: The widespread integration of wearable sensing devices in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems, particularly in healthcare, smart homes, and industrial
applications, has required robust human activity recognition (HAR) techniques
to improve functionality and user experience. Although machine learning models
have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks
that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems.
Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require
extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits
adaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework
that uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and
sanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot
learning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \textit{role play} prompting,
whereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor
anomalies, and \textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer
poisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.
These strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable
robust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive
evaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization
quality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality
and effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable
IoT systems.

Conclusion: LLM在自动标注数据使用案例方面具有潜力，但实际应用仍面临数据可用性、计算成本和评估方法等挑战。

Abstract: Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between
specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing
that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to
explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with
pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential
means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published
literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of
training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we
apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case
labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also
introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our
methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score
of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously
defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers
related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure,
and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ROGUE-TS算法，一种针对ROGUE（减少或获得未知效能）多臂老虎机框架的Thompson Sampling方法，通过概率裁剪平衡个性化推荐和群体层面学习，在微随机试验中实现低后悔值和高统计功效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法在ROGUE框架下可能因过度强调利用而探索不足，限制了群体层面效应的估计能力，这在微随机试验中尤为重要，需要平衡个性化推荐和统计有效性。

Method: 开发了ROGUE-TS算法（针对ROGUE框架的Thompson Sampling），并引入概率裁剪程序来平衡个性化学习和群体层面学习，量化了后悔值和最小探索概率之间的权衡。

Result: 在两个微随机试验数据集（身体活动促进和双相情感障碍治疗）上的验证表明，该方法比现有方法获得更低的后悔值，并通过裁剪程序保持高统计功效，且不显著增加后悔值。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计微随机试验的研究人员提供了平衡个性化和统计有效性的实用指导，能够可靠检测治疗效果同时考虑个体行为动态。

Abstract: A common challenge for decision makers is selecting actions whose rewards are
unknown and evolve over time based on prior policies. For instance, repeated
use may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may
restore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or
Gaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world
settings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can
compute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not
provide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting
the ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of
particular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in
developing just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level
effects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In
this paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored
to the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.
We then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization
and population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret
and minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning
physical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our
methods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high
statistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly
increasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while
accounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs,
our framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with
statistical validity.

across road networks. Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain
largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and
optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital
Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven
pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and
spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV,
sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns
deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and
enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with
segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of
0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear
degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement
learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance
planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and
establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the
approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement
management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent
coordination, and smart-city integration.

TL;DR: 提出UserAlign方法，通过少量成对响应比较来个性化对齐生成模型与用户偏好，基于逻辑赌博机理论框架快速识别最佳响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化对齐方法要么需要大量用户偏好查询，要么要求偏好以文本形式明确指定，这在实际应用中存在限制。

Method: 基于逻辑赌博机中的最佳臂识别理论框架，通过少量成对响应比较来获取用户偏好，从模型生成的固定响应池中选择个性化响应。

Result: 在个性化文本和图像生成任务上的实验结果表明，UserAlign能够有效实现个性化对齐。

Conclusion: UserAlign是一种有效的推理时个性化对齐方法，能够以少量查询实现用户偏好的准确对齐。

Abstract: We study the problem of aligning a generative model's response with a user's
preferences. Recent works have proposed several different formulations for
personalized alignment; however, they either require a large amount of user
preference queries or require that the preference be explicitly specified as a
text input. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time personalized
alignment method, UserAlign, that elicits the user's preferences with a few
queries as pairwise response comparisons. In particular, UserAlign builds on
the theoretical framework of best-arm identification in logistic bandits and
selects a personalized response from a fixed pool of the model's generated
responses. The key idea is to consider the user's feedback consistent and
noise-free, and incorporate it into the theoretical framework to identify the
best response quickly. Experimental results across several tasks, involving
personalized text and image generation, showcase the effectiveness of UserAlign
in achieving personalized alignment.

Conclusion: 基于期望信息价值的Bootstrapped DQN方法能够有效增强深度探索能力，在复杂环境中实现更高效的探索与利用平衡。

Abstract: Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning remains a fundamental
challenge, especially in environments characterized by high-dimensional states
and sparse rewards. Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random
local policy noise, such as $\epsilon$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration
methods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In
this paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI)
within the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the
algorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel
algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of
information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information
estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network
heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate
our algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit
inherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our
experiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased
performance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly,
without introducing extra hyperparameters.

Abstract: Metamaterials are engineered materials composed of specially designed unit
cells that exhibit extraordinary properties beyond those of natural materials.
Complex engineering tasks often require heterogeneous unit cells to accommodate
spatially varying property requirements. However, designing heterogeneous
metamaterials poses significant challenges due to the enormous design space and
strict compatibility requirements between neighboring cells. Traditional
concurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization
problem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell
boundaries. On the other hand, data-driven approaches that assemble structures
from a fixed library of microstructures are limited by the dataset and require
additional post-processing to ensure seamless connections. In this work, we
propose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a
continuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly
addressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural
representation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and
local (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that
represents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across
the domain, without the need for a predefined dataset. We use a compatibility
loss term during training to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells.
Once trained, the network can produce metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high
resolution, hence enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on mechanical
metamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems
with potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.

Abstract: Generating graph-structured data is crucial in applications such as molecular
generation, knowledge graphs, and network analysis. However, their discrete,
unordered nature makes them difficult for traditional generative models,
leading to the rise of discrete diffusion and flow matching models. In this
work, we introduce GraphBSI, a novel one-shot graph generative model based on
Bayesian Sample Inference (BSI). Instead of evolving samples directly, GraphBSI
iteratively refines a belief over graphs in the continuous space of
distribution parameters, naturally handling discrete structures. Further, we
state BSI as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and derive a
noise-controlled family of SDEs that preserves the marginal distributions via
an approximation of the score function. Our theoretical analysis further
reveals the connection to Bayesian Flow Networks and Diffusion models. Finally,
in our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on
molecular and synthetic graph generation, outperforming existing one-shot graph
generative models on the standard benchmarks Moses and GuacaMol.

Abstract: Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is
essential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation.
Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal
conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an
alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate
telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the
predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users.
In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework
for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live
telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless''
monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48
million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever
used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements
over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the
simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\sim$
2.31$^\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\sim$
7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root
mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\sim$ 3.26$^\circ$C for temperature (vs
3.38$^\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs
10.0% by sensorless). Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo
monitoring, early risk detection, and less dependence on full connectivity in
global shipping.

Result: DADO算法能够更有效地利用设计变量的可分解性，提高优化效率。

Conclusion: DADO为利用可分解性结构的分布优化提供了新方法，在科学应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design
discrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example,
we may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a
circuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a
property predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a
generative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to
concentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization
-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as
reinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that
maximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over
discrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial
nature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific
applications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over
design variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective
optimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may
only loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve
maximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are
unable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and
demonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,
Decomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any
decomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make
optimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized
"search distribution" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation
of the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization
across linked factors.

Abstract: Recent work in financial machine learning has shown the virtue of complexity:
the phenomenon by which deep learning methods capable of learning highly
nonlinear relationships outperform simpler approaches in financial forecasting.
While transformer architectures like Informer have shown promise for financial
time series forecasting, the application of transformer models for options data
remains largely unexplored. We conduct preliminary studies towards the
development of a transformer model for options data by training the Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture, typically used in modern image recognition and
classification systems, to predict the realized volatility of an asset over the
next 30 days from its implied volatility surface (augmented with date
information) for a single day. We show that the ViT can learn seasonal patterns
and nonlinear features from the IV surface, suggesting a promising direction
for model development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen increasing popularity in enterprise
applications where AI agents and humans engage in objective-driven
interactions. However, these systems are difficult to evaluate: data may be
complex and unlabeled; human annotation is often impractical at scale; custom
metrics can monitor for specific errors, but not previously-undetected ones;
and LLM judges can produce unreliable results. We introduce the first set of
unsupervised metrics for objective-driven interactions, leveraging statistical
properties of unlabeled interaction data and using fine-tuned LLMs to adapt to
distributional shifts. We develop metrics for labeling user goals, measuring
goal completion, and quantifying LLM uncertainty without grounding evaluations
in human-generated ideal responses. Our approach is validated on open-domain
and task-specific interaction data.

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的表示空间确实具有曲率，注意力机制在弯曲流形上实现了平行传输，这为理解模型内部工作机制提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for understanding Transformer-based language
models, drawing an explicit analogy to General Relativity. Queries and keys
induce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a
discrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across
tokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token
representations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the
role of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in
parameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not
traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps
should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.
To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence
and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a
full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and
layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat
angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality
or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe
deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,
meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm
attention-induced curvature.

Abstract: For far too long, expressivity of graph neural networks has been measured
\emph{only} in terms of combinatorial properties. In this work we stray away
from this tradition and provide a principled way to measure similarity between
vertex attributed graphs. We denote this measure as the \emph{graph
homomorphism distortion}. We show it can \emph{completely characterize} graphs
and thus is also a \emph{complete graph embedding}. However, somewhere along
the road, we run into the graph canonization problem. To circumvent this
obstacle, we devise to efficiently compute this measure via sampling, which in
expectation ensures \emph{completeness}. Additionally, we also discovered that
we can obtain a metric from this measure. We validate our claims empirically
and find that the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}: (1.) fully
distinguishes the \texttt{BREC} dataset with up to $4$-WL non-distinguishable
graphs, and (2.) \emph{outperforms} previous methods inspired in homomorphisms
under the \texttt{ZINC-12k} dataset.
  These theoretical results, (and their empirical validation), pave the way for
future characterization of graphs, extending the graph theoretic tradition to
new frontiers.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) studies how to recommend a short ranked list
of items from a large pool and improves future rankings based on user clicks.
This setting is commonly modeled as cascading bandits, where the objective is
to maximize the likelihood that the user clicks on at least one of the
presented items across as many timesteps as possible. However, such systems are
vulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where
bots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning
process and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust
algorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our
knowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time.
This estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no
cost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out
outliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value.
Updating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence
in experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence
of corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing
only by an additive term tied to the total corruption. Comprehensive and
extensive experiments on real-world datasets further demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms prior methods while maintaining strong
robustness. In particular, it achieves a \(97.35\%\) and a \(91.60\%\) regret
improvement over two state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich
and versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the
statistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,
causing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare
signals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,
creating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine
this gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods
operating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;
locality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote
efficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of
self-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation
space around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these
principles, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained
within a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the
likelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,
anomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms
that drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional
problems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion
detection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the
natural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing
only a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous
locations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring
both the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: DiCoDe为agent-environment协同设计设立了新标准，是实现现实世界协同设计收益的重要里程碑。

Abstract: The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and
environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With
application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management,
co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems.
However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under
high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency
when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these
challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and
sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically
relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we
introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables
DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while
satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.
Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the
reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts
to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.
Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when
validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including
warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our
method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%
higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This
sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone
towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.

Abstract: The uprising of deep learning methodology and practice in recent years has
brought about a severe consequence of increasing carbon footprint due to the
insatiable demand for computational resources and power. The field of text
analytics also experienced a massive transformation in this trend of
monopolizing methodology. In this paper, the original TF-IDF algorithm has been
modified, and Clement Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (CTF-IDF) has
been proposed for data preprocessing. This paper primarily discusses the
effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques in text analytics with
CTF-IDF and a faster IRLBA algorithm for dimensionality reduction. The
introduction of both of these techniques in the conventional text analytics
pipeline ensures a more efficient, faster, and less computationally intensive
application when compared with deep learning methodology regarding carbon
footprint, with minor compromise in accuracy. The experimental results also
exhibit a manifold of reduction in time complexity and improvement of model
accuracy for the classical machine learning methods discussed further in this
paper.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的梯度估计方法，通过操纵上游雅可比矩阵来减少偏差和方差，在更宽的网络中表现更好，有望扩展到大型网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播需要两次前向传播和存储中间激活值，而现有的前向模式自动微分方法由于估计方差高难以扩展到小型网络之外，且现有减少方差的方法引入了显著偏差。

Method: 通过操纵上游雅可比矩阵来计算猜测方向，从而减少梯度估计的偏差和方差。

Result: 该方法在更宽的网络中表现更好，展示了有希望的结果，并具有扩展到更大网络的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分析偏差和方差及其与神经网络梯度低维结构的联系，提供了一种有前景的梯度估计替代方案。

Abstract: While backpropagation--reverse-mode automatic differentiation--has been
extraordinarily successful in deep learning, it requires two passes (forward
and backward) through the neural network and the storage of intermediate
activations. Existing gradient estimation methods that instead use forward-mode
automatic differentiation struggle to scale beyond small networks due to the
high variance of the estimates. Efforts to mitigate this have so far introduced
significant bias to the estimates, reducing their utility. We introduce a
gradient estimation approach that reduces both bias and variance by
manipulating upstream Jacobian matrices when computing guess directions. It
shows promising results and has the potential to scale to larger networks,
indeed performing better as the network width is increased. Our understanding
of this method is facilitated by analyses of bias and variance, and their
connection to the low-dimensional structure of neural network gradients.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FP-AbDiff是首个在整个生成轨迹中强制执行Fokker-Planck方程物理学的抗体生成器，通过FPE残差损失确保物理一致性，在RAbD基准测试中创下新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体生成模型存在两个核心挑战：缺乏动力学一致性导致物理上不可行的结构，以及由于数据稀缺和结构偏差导致的泛化能力差。

Method: 在CDR几何混合流形上最小化新颖的FPE残差损失，将局部学习的去噪分数组装成全局一致的概率流，并与最先进的SE(3)-等变扩散框架中的深度生物先验协同整合。

Result: 在从头CDR-H3设计中，可变区叠加的均方根偏差为0.99Å，比之前最先进模型AbX提高25%；接触氨基酸恢复率达到39.91%；在更具挑战性的六CDR协同设计中，全链均方根偏差降低约15%，CDR-H3环的氨基酸恢复率达到45.67%。

Conclusion: 通过将生成动力学与物理定律对齐，FP-AbDiff增强了鲁棒性和泛化能力，为物理忠实且功能可行的抗体设计建立了原则性方法。

Abstract: Computational antibody design holds immense promise for therapeutic
discovery, yet existing generative models are fundamentally limited by two core
challenges: (i) a lack of dynamical consistency, which yields physically
implausible structures, and (ii) poor generalization due to data scarcity and
structural bias. We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to
enforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative
trajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed
manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising
scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This
physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological
priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework.
Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a
new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean
Square Deviation of 0.99 {\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25%
improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest
reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored
in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers
consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root
Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain
Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By
aligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness
and generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically
faithful and functionally viable antibody design.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于增强重叠理论的对比学习分析框架，推导了更紧致的性能边界，并开发了无需额外模块的无监督表示评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督对比学习虽然取得了成功，但其工作机制尚不清晰，特别是基于条件独立性假设的理论分析存在局限性。

Method: 首先在条件独立性假设下推导最紧致的性能边界，然后放松该假设，提出更实用的增强重叠假设，并基于此推导渐近闭式边界。

Result: 提出的增强重叠理论表明，在激进数据增强下，同类样本的支持集会更加重叠，仅对齐正样本就能使对比学习将同类样本聚类在一起。

Conclusion: 从增强重叠视角开发的无监督表示评估指标与下游性能高度一致，几乎不需要额外模块，为对比学习提供了新的理论理解和实用工具。

Abstract: Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has achieved great success on
various tasks. However, its underlying working mechanism is yet unclear. In
this paper, we first provide the tightest bounds based on the widely adopted
assumption of conditional independence. Further, we relax the conditional
independence assumption to a more practical assumption of augmentation overlap
and derive the asymptotically closed bounds for the downstream performance. Our
proposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of
different intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data
augmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of
the same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples
together. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we
develop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive
learning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without
relying on additional modules. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了两种新型攻击框架StaDec和DyDec，用于系统生成动态自适应的对抗样本，评估LLM在敏感任务中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当将LLMs应用于敏感任务时，需要全面评估其对抗输入的鲁棒性，但目前缺乏系统性的评估方法。

Method: 利用LLM驱动的自动化管道生成语义相似但能有效欺骗目标LLM的对抗样本，无需依赖外部启发式方法。

Result: 攻击方法能随LLM发展而演进，并在攻击者未知的模型间表现出强迁移性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM的鲁棒性自我评估提供了系统性方法。

Abstract: LLMs can provide substantial zero-shot performance on diverse tasks using a
simple task prompt, eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning. However,
when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly
assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce
Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack
frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial
examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and
natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the
original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an
automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external
heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate
strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this
work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's
robustness. We release our code and data at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了自适应分位数重校准（AQR）方法，一种无需重新训练模型的无监督测试时适应技术，通过通道级分位数对齐来修改预激活分布，在各种架构和数据集上优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统域适应方法需要目标域先验知识或模型重新训练的限制，以及现有测试时适应方法无法捕捉复杂激活分布且局限于特定归一化层的问题。

Method: AQR通过通道级分位数对齐修改预激活分布，采用鲁棒的尾部校准策略处理不同批次大小下的分布尾部估计问题，利用训练时计算的源域统计量实现无监督适应。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-C、CIFAR-100-C和ImageNet-C数据集上的实验表明，AQR在各种架构下都能实现鲁棒的适应性能，优于现有的测试时适应基线方法。

Conclusion: AQR在动态和不可预测数据分布的真实场景中具有部署潜力，能够有效提升深度学习模型在现实场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a key strategy for enhancing the generalizability of
deep learning models in real-world scenarios, where test distributions often
diverge significantly from the training domain. However, conventional
approaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require
model retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or
resource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on
batch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but
they often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained
to specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration
(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation
distributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the
full shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures
employing BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of
estimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a
robust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our
method leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling
unsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,
CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR
achieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing
test-time adaptation baselines. These results highlight AQR's potential for
deployment in real-world scenarios with dynamic and unpredictable data
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常预测方法局限于特定系统，无法适应随时间演变的异常模式；而预训练时间序列基础模型虽然具有强大的泛化能力，但尚未用于异常预测任务。

Method: 提出F2A框架：1）联合预测-异常损失，微调模型以准确预测异常时间点的信号；2）检索增强生成模块，动态检索历史相关时段并基于此进行预测，适应推理时的分布变化。

Result: 在16个多样化数据集和多个TSFM骨干网络上的广泛实验表明，F2A始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: F2A通过目标微调和动态检索的结合，填补了稳健TSFM零样本预测与零样本异常预测之间的空白，为实际应用提供了可扩展的零样本异常预测解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting anomalies (anomaly prediction) in multivariate time series from
different real-world, dynamic, and complex systems is vital for preempting
critical failures, leading to a substantial minimization in operational costs
and human labor. Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while
failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast,
pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated
strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their
potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally
different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly
(F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities
through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss
that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous
time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module
that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on
them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference
time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates.
By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap
between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction.
Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones
show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a
scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnCLe是一种用于可扩展动态因果发现的深度学习方法，通过解耦和重耦合网络将时间序列分解为语义表示，利用自回归依赖矩阵学习变量间依赖关系，通过分析时间扰动引起的预测误差来估计动态因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从观测时间序列中发现因果关系对于理解复杂系统至关重要。现有方法主要推断静态因果图，但现实系统通常表现出动态因果关系——关系随时间演变。准确捕捉这些时间动态需要时间分辨的因果图。

Method: UnCLe采用一对解耦器和重耦合器网络，将输入时间序列解耦为语义表示，通过自回归依赖矩阵学习变量间依赖关系，通过分析时间扰动引起的逐数据点预测误差来估计动态因果影响。

Result: 大量实验表明，UnCLe不仅在静态因果发现基准测试中优于最先进的基线方法，更重要的是，在合成和真实世界动态系统（如人体运动）中表现出准确捕捉和表示演化时间因果性的独特能力。

Conclusion: UnCLe为揭示复杂现象背后的时变机制提供了一种有前景的方法，能够有效发现动态因果关系。

Abstract: Uncovering cause-effect relationships from observational time series is
fundamental to understanding complex systems. While many methods infer static
causal graphs, real-world systems often exhibit dynamic causality-where
relationships evolve over time. Accurately capturing these temporal dynamics
requires time-resolved causal graphs. We propose UnCLe, a novel deep learning
method for scalable dynamic causal discovery. UnCLe employs a pair of Uncoupler
and Recoupler networks to disentangle input time series into semantic
representations and learns inter-variable dependencies via auto-regressive
Dependency Matrices. It estimates dynamic causal influences by analyzing
datapoint-wise prediction errors induced by temporal perturbations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UnCLe not only outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on static causal discovery benchmarks but, more importantly, exhibits
a unique capability to accurately capture and represent evolving temporal
causality in both synthetic and real-world dynamic systems (e.g., human
motion). UnCLe offers a promising approach for revealing the underlying,
time-varying mechanisms of complex phenomena.

TL;DR: 提出了PSD框架，通过将状态映射到圆形潜在空间来无监督发现周期性技能，特别适用于需要周期性行为的机器人任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督技能发现方法忽视了技能的周期性特征，而许多机器人任务（特别是运动任务）需要在不同时间尺度上表现出周期性行为。

Method: 训练编码器将状态映射到圆形潜在空间，在潜在表示中自然编码周期性，通过捕捉时间距离来学习具有不同周期的技能。

Result: PSD能够在复杂机器人任务中有效学习具有不同周期的技能，即使基于像素观察也能工作，并且在下游任务（如跨栏）中表现出高性能。

Conclusion: PSD框架成功发现了多样化的周期性技能，与现有技能发现方法结合可提供更丰富的行为库，扩展了智能体的技能储备。

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn
diverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods
often overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on
increasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the
distance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --
particularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across
varying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is
essential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a
framework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key
idea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,
thereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By
capturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse
periods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We
further show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream
tasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill
discovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's
repertoire. Our code and demos are available at

<details>

Motivation: 传统注意力机制在时间序列建模中由于二次计算复杂度限制了长序列的可扩展性，需要开发更高效的线性注意力方法。

Method: 基于熵理论，证明具有对齐概率排名和相似熵值的分布具有结构相似性，开发了线性复杂度的熵近似算法，构建了基于熵等式的线性注意力机制。

Result: 在四个时空数据集上的实验表明，该方法在预测性能上具有竞争力或更优表现，同时显著减少了内存使用和计算时间。

Conclusion: 注意力机制在时空时间序列建模中的有效性可能主要源于获得适度且平衡的权重分布，而非softmax的非线性特性，线性注意力机制是可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have been extensively employed in various applications,
including time series modeling, owing to their capacity to capture intricate
dependencies; however, their utility is often constrained by quadratic
computational complexity, which impedes scalability for long sequences. In this
work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these
limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that
entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies
that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values
exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an
efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of
dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the
implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality.
Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in
spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the
non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and
well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four
spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or
superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both
memory usage and computational time.

Conclusion: Copula驱动的多模态学习框架能够有效建模模态间复杂交互，并为缺失模态生成准确表示，在多模态学习任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Various data modalities are common in real-world applications (e.g.,
electronic health records, medical images and clinical notes in healthcare). It
is essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various
information from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to
appropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a
joint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the
Kronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities
and indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the
joint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is
underexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the
interactions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution
and marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel
copula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the
joint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions
among them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align
the marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a
Gaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint
distribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing
modalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of our model over other competitors. The code is available

Motivation: 气候模型受限于计算成本，通常输出粗空间分辨率，而许多气候变化影响研究需要更精细的尺度。统计降尺度可以弥合这一差距。

Method: 采用概率U-Net，结合确定性U-Net主干和变分潜在空间来捕捉任意不确定性。评估了四种训练目标：afCRPS和WMSE-MS-SSIM（三种设置），用于降尺度降水和温度（从16倍粗分辨率）。

Result: 主要发现是：WMSE-MS-SSIM在某些设置下对极端值表现良好，而afCRPS能更好地捕捉跨尺度的空间变异性。

Conclusion: 不同的训练目标在降尺度任务中各有优势，需要根据具体应用场景选择合适的方法。

Abstract: Climate models are limited by heavy computational costs, often producing
outputs at coarse spatial resolutions, while many climate change impact studies
require finer scales. Statistical downscaling bridges this gap, and we adapt
the probabilistic U-Net for this task, combining a deterministic U-Net backbone
with a variational latent space to capture aleatoric uncertainty. We evaluate
four training objectives, afCRPS and WMSE-MS-SSIM with three settings for
downscaling precipitation and temperature from $16\times$ coarser resolution.
Our main finding is that WMSE-MS-SSIM performs well for extremes under certain
settings, whereas afCRPS better captures spatial variability across scales.

Abstract: In an effort to counter the increasing IoT botnet-based attacks,
state-of-the-art deep learning methods have been proposed and have achieved
impressive detection accuracy. However, their computational intensity restricts
deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a critical need for
lightweight detection models. A common solution to this challenge is model
compression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework
where an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors
derived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a
pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization
strategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization
(PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection
performance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT
botnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with
respect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable
decline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original
unquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in
size, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the
practicality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.

Abstract: Urban flooding is expected to increase in frequency and severity as a
consequence of climate change, causing wide-ranging impacts that include a
decrease in urban Quality of Life (QoL). Meanwhile, policymakers must devise
adaptation strategies that can cope with the uncertain nature of climate change
and the complex and dynamic nature of urban flooding. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) holds significant promise in tackling such complex, dynamic, and uncertain
problems. Because of this, we use RL to identify which climate adaptation
pathways lead to a higher QoL in the long term. We do this using an Integrated
Assessment Model (IAM) which combines a rainfall projection model, a flood
model, a transport accessibility model, and a quality of life index. Our
preliminary results suggest that this approach can be used to learn optimal
adaptation measures and it outperforms other realistic and real-world planning
strategies. Our framework is publicly available:

Conclusion: FCDC将数据收集从被动流水线阶段转变为自我调节的反馈驱动过程，成为数据中心AI的核心

Abstract: Modern AI systems are increasingly constrained not by model capacity but by
the quality and diversity of their data. Despite growing emphasis on
data-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which
accumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This
results in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To
address this, this paper introduces \ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data
collection as a closed-loop control problem. \ac{FCDC} continuously
approximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online
probabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on
feedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this
feedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and
exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from
accumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \ac{FCDC} on
a synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \ac{FCDC}
produces more balanced datasets by $\SI{25.9}{\percent}$ while reducing data
storage by $\SI{39.8}{\percent}$. These results demonstrate that data
collection itself can be actively controlled, transforming collection from a
passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the
core of data-centric AI.

### [96] [A unified physics-informed generative operator framework for general inverse problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03241)
*Gang Bao,Yaohua Zang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IGNO的新型生成神经算子框架，用于解决由偏微分方程控制的逆问题，无需标记训练数据，能够统一处理点测量和算子值数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法需要大量标记数据集或局限于特定测量类型，在稀疏、噪声或高维不连续系数情况下表现不佳，限制了实际应用。

Method: IGNO将高维可能不连续的系数场编码到低维潜在空间，通过神经算子解码器重建系数和PDE解，仅依赖物理约束通过PDE残差进行训练，使用基于梯度的优化在潜在空间进行高效反演。

Result: 在多种挑战性逆问题中，包括从不连续系数恢复和带算子测量的EIT问题，IGNO实现了准确、稳定和可扩展的反演，在严重噪声下表现优异，始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: IGNO为计算科学领域中的挑战性逆问题提供了一个统一而强大的框架。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
central to science and engineering, yet remains challenging when measurements
are sparse, noisy, or when the underlying coefficients are high-dimensional or
discontinuous. Existing deep learning approaches either require extensive
labeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, often leading to
failure in such regimes and restricting their practical applicability. Here, a
novel generative neural operator framework, IGNO, is introduced to overcome
these limitations. IGNO unifies the solution of inverse problems from both
point measurements and operator-valued data without labeled training pairs.
This framework encodes high-dimensional, potentially discontinuous coefficient
fields into a low-dimensional latent space, which drives neural operator
decoders to reconstruct both coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies
purely on physics constraints through PDE residuals, while inversion proceeds
via efficient gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a
priori normalizing flow model. Across a diverse set of challenging inverse
problems, including recovery of discontinuous coefficients from solution-based
measurements and the EIT problem with operator-based measurements, IGNO
consistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion even under
severe noise. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method under
varying noise levels and demonstrates strong generalization to
out-of-distribution targets. These results establish IGNO as a unified and
powerful framework for tackling challenging inverse problems across
computational science domains.

TL;DR: 提出了GMoPE框架，将混合专家架构与基于提示的图学习相结合，通过专家特定的提示向量和结构感知路由实现跨领域泛化，显著降低适应成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在跨领域和任务泛化能力有限的问题，包括负迁移、可扩展性差和适应成本高等挑战。

Method: GMoPE框架整合混合专家架构与提示学习，使用专家特定提示向量和结构感知MoE路由，引入软正交约束促进专家多样性，采用仅提示微调策略降低复杂度。

Result: 在各种预训练策略和下游任务中，GMoPE持续优于最先进基线，性能接近全参数微调，同时仅需少量适应开销。

Conclusion: GMoPE为推进通用化和高效的图基础模型提供了一个原则性和可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their ability to generalize across diverse
domains and tasks remains limited. Existing approaches often struggle with
negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address
these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt
vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in
distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote
diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality
constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and
facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a
prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal
complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments
under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results
show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring
only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and
scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation
models.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习在气候变化背景下制定洪水适应政策，考虑不确定性和不同优先级（经济vs生活质量）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化将增加洪水频率和严重性，需要有效的适应政策，但长期气候影响存在不确定性且政策包含重要的规范性选择

Method: 结合强化学习和综合评估模型，连接降雨洪水模型，计算洪水对生活质量、交通和基础设施的影响

Result: 优先考虑生活质量的模型会导致更多适应支出，并在研究区域内更均匀地分配支出

Conclusion: 强化学习是识别不确定条件下适应路径的有用工具，同时允许明确建模和比较不同的适应优先级

Abstract: Climate change will cause an increase in the frequency and severity of flood
events, prompting the need for cohesive adaptation policymaking. Designing
effective adaptation policies, however, depends on managing the uncertainty of
long-term climate impacts. Meanwhile, such policies can feature important
normative choices that are not always made explicit. We propose that
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be a useful tool to both identify adaptation
pathways under uncertain conditions while it also allows for the explicit
modelling (and consequent comparison) of different adaptation priorities (e.g.
economic vs. wellbeing). We use an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) to link
together a rainfall and flood model, and compute the impacts of flooding in
terms of quality of life (QoL), transportation, and infrastructure damage. Our
results show that models prioritising QoL over economic impacts results in more
adaptation spending as well as a more even distribution of spending over the
study area, highlighting the extent to which such normative assumptions can
alter adaptation policy. Our framework is publicly available:

*Felix Störck,Fabian Hinder,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于核方法和连续保护属性的公平性方法，通过空问投影技术扩展了公平性评估到回归任务中的连续属性场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在日常社会生活中的广泛应用，公平性成为重要考量。现有研究主要关注离散属性，而连续属性（特别是回归任务中的连续公平性）的研究相对匮乏。

Method: 提出了一种模型和公平性评分无关的核嵌入方法，通过迭代空问投影技术扩展到核方法，支持连续保护属性，并与支持向量回归（SVR）结合使用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上与其他当代方法相比，提供了竞争性或改进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将公平性评估扩展到核方法和连续保护属性，为连续公平性研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With the on-going integration of machine learning systems into the everyday
social life of millions the notion of fairness becomes an ever increasing
priority in their development. Fairness notions commonly rely on protected
attributes to assess potential biases. Here, the majority of literature focuses
on discrete setups regarding both target and protected attributes. The
literature on continuous attributes especially in conjunction with regression
-- we refer to this as \emph{continuous fairness} -- is scarce. A common
strategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been
explored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear
encoder. We improve on this by generalizing to kernel methods, significantly
extending the scope. This yields a model and fairness-score agnostic method for
kernel embeddings applicable to continuous protected attributes. We demonstrate
that our novel approach in conjunction with Support Vector Regression (SVR)
provides competitive or improved performance across multiple datasets in
comparisons to other contemporary methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了经典熵最小化(EM)的内在机制，将其解耦为两个相反作用的部分，并提出自适应解耦熵最小化(AdaDEM)来解决经典EM的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典熵最小化虽然有助于减少类别重叠、缩小领域差距和限制不确定性，但其潜力有限。需要研究EM的内在机制并解决其局限性。

Method: 将经典EM解耦为集群聚合驱动因子(CADF)和梯度缓解校准器(GMC)，然后提出AdaDEM方法，通过标准化CADF的奖励和用边缘熵校准器(MEC)替代GMC。

Result: AdaDEM在噪声和动态环境中的各种不完美监督学习任务中表现优于DEM*(经典EM的上界变体)，取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦经典EM并引入自适应机制，AdaDEM有效解决了奖励崩溃和易类偏差问题，在不完美监督学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridging
domain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning,
yet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, we
reformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects:
cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts
a peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC)
penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities.
Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled
formulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty
samples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment
between output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we
propose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the
reward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to
replace GMC. AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM,
and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised
learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散语言模型在数据受限时通过更多训练轮次超越自回归模型，这种优势源于任意顺序建模、迭代双向去噪的超密集计算和内置蒙特卡洛增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在严格控制的预训练设置下，当独特数据有限时，扩散语言模型相比自回归模型的性能表现，探索数据约束下的模型训练策略。

Method: 在匹配的计算预算下对比扩散语言模型和自回归模型，分析不同数据量、模型大小和架构下的性能交叉点，识别扩散模型的优势因素。

Result: 1.7B参数的扩散语言模型在10B独特Python token上训练，使用约1.5T token计算预算，超越了匹配设置下的自回归编码器。1B参数的扩散模型仅用1B token就实现了HellaSwag >56%和MMLU >33%的准确率。

Conclusion: 扩散语言模型在数据受限场景下具有显著优势，验证交叉熵上升并不一定意味着下游性能下降，为数据高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Under strictly controlled pre-training settings, we observe a Crossover: when
unique data is limited, diffusion language models (DLMs) consistently surpass
autoregressive (AR) models by training for more epochs. The crossover shifts
later with more or higher-quality data, earlier with larger models, and
persists across dense and sparse architectures. We attribute the gains to three
compounding factors: (1) any-order modeling, (2) super-dense compute from
iterative bidirectional denoising, and (3) built-in Monte Carlo augmentation;
input or parameter noise improves AR under data constraint but cannot close the
gap. At scale, a 1.7B DLM trained with a ~1.5T-token compute budget on 10B
unique Python tokens overtakes an AR coder trained with strictly matched
settings. In addition, a 1B-parameter DLM achieves > 56% accuracy on HellaSwag
and > 33% on MMLU using only 1B tokens, without any special tricks, just by
repeating standard pre-training data. We also show that rising validation
cross-entropy does not imply degraded downstream performance in this regime.

TL;DR: 提出Adaptable HER框架，将后见经验回放与AlphaZero结合，解决稀疏奖励环境下神经网络训练困难的问题，在方程发现等任务中表现优于纯监督或强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero在稀疏奖励环境（特别是早期阶段）中，由于神经网络无法提供有效指导，导致训练困难。后见经验回放通过重新标记失败轨迹作为监督信号来缓解这一问题。

Method: 开发Adaptable HER框架，灵活整合HER与AlphaZero，允许调整HER的重标记目标、策略目标和轨迹选择等属性。

Result: 实验（包括方程发现任务）表明，修改HER的可能性是有益的，并且超越了纯监督或强化学习的性能。

Conclusion: Adaptable HER框架成功解决了AlphaZero在稀疏奖励环境中的训练挑战，通过灵活的HER集成实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: AlphaZero-like Monte Carlo Tree Search systems, originally introduced for
two-player games, dynamically balance exploration and exploitation using neural
network guidance. This combination makes them also suitable for classical
search problems. However, the original method of training the network with
simulation results is limited in sparse reward settings, especially in the
early stages, where the network cannot yet give guidance. Hindsight Experience
Replay (HER) addresses this issue by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories from
the search tree as supervised learning signals. We introduce Adaptable HER
(\ours{}), a flexible framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero, allowing
easy adjustments to HER properties such as relabeled goals, policy targets, and
trajectory selection. Our experiments, including equation discovery, show that
the possibility of modifying HER is beneficial and surpasses the performance of
pure supervised or reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 传统限流算法（如令牌桶、滑动窗口）难以适应动态流量模式和变化系统负载，需要更智能的限流机制来确保云微服务架构的系统稳定性

Method: 设计结合DQN和A3C算法的混合架构，将限流决策过程建模为马尔可夫决策过程，通过环境交互学习最优限流策略

Result: 高负载场景下吞吐量提升23.7%，P99延迟降低31.4%；90天生产部署处理5亿日请求，服务降级事件减少82%，人工干预减少68%

Conclusion: 基于深度强化学习的自适应限流策略能有效平衡系统吞吐量和服务延迟，在动态云环境中优于传统方法

Abstract: As cloud computing and microservice architectures become increasingly
prevalent, API rate limiting has emerged as a critical mechanism for ensuring
system stability and service quality. Traditional rate limiting algorithms,
such as token bucket and sliding window, while widely adopted, struggle to
adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and varying system loads. This paper proposes
an adaptive rate limiting strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that
dynamically balances system throughput and service latency. We design a hybrid
architecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling the rate limiting decision process as a
Markov Decision Process. The system continuously monitors microservice states
and learns optimal rate limiting policies through environmental interaction.
Extensive experiments conducted in a Kubernetes cluster environment demonstrate
that our approach achieves 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% P99 latency
reduction compared to traditional fixed-threshold strategies under high-load
scenarios. Results from a 90-day production deployment handling 500 million
daily requests validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method,
with 82% reduction in service degradation incidents and 68% decrease in manual
interventions.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了基于离散余弦变换(DCT)参数化的表达性神经网络(ENN)，重点研究了其效率、可解释性和剪枝能力。DCT参数化提供了结构化表示，可直接识别冗余组件，实现高效剪枝。实验表明ENN在保持参数数量的同时达到SOTA精度，且可安全剪枝40%的激活系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在之前证明ENN紧凑架构强表达性的基础上，本文强调其效率、可解释性和剪枝能力，旨在将信号处理概念原则性地集成到神经网络设计中，实现表达性、紧凑性和可解释性之间的平衡。

Method: 使用基于离散余弦变换(DCT)的参数化方法构建多层感知机，DCT提供了结构化和去相关的表示，能够揭示每个神经元的功能角色。利用这一特性提出高效的剪枝策略，移除不必要的DCT系数。

Result: 在分类和隐式神经表示任务上的实验结果表明，ENN在保持参数数量较低的同时达到最先进的准确率。由于DCT基的正交性和有界性，可安全剪枝高达40%的激活系数，且性能损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: ENN框架成功将信号处理概念原则性地集成到神经网络设计中，实现了表达性、紧凑性和可解释性之间的平衡权衡，为神经网络设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous work on the Expressive Neural Network
(ENN), a multilayer perceptron with adaptive activation functions parametrized
using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Building upon previous work that
demonstrated the strong expressiveness of ENNs with compact architectures, we
now emphasize their efficiency, interpretability and pruning capabilities. The
DCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated
representation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows
direct identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we
propose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients
with negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across
classification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters.
Furthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned,
thanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of
signal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced
trade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability.

Abstract: From molecular imaging to wireless communications, the ability to align and
reconstruct signals from multiple misaligned observations is crucial for system
performance. We study the problem of multi-reference alignment (MRA), which
arises in many real-world problems, such as cryo-EM, computer vision, and, in
particular, wireless communication systems. Using a probabilistic approach to
model MRA, we find a new algorithm that uses relative poses as nuisance
variables to marginalize out -- thereby removing the global symmetries of the
problem and allowing for more direct solutions and improved convergence. The
decentralization of this approach enables significant computational savings by
avoiding the cubic scaling of centralized methods through cycle consistency.
Both proposed algorithms achieve lower reconstruction error across experimental
settings.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills by observing and
replicating the behavior of one or multiple experts. In recent years, advances
in deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability
of imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range
from full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled
sequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new
methodologies being developed to address longstanding challenges such as
generalization, covariate shift, and demonstration quality. In this survey, we
review the latest advances in imitation learning research, highlighting recent
trends, methodological innovations, and practical applications. We propose a
novel taxonomy that is distinct from existing categorizations to better reflect
the current state of the IL research stratum and its trends. Throughout the
survey, we critically examine the strengths, limitations, and evaluation
practices of representative works, and we outline key challenges and open
directions for future research.

Motivation: 解决微服务架构中异常检测和根因追踪的问题，需要同时考虑服务间的复杂结构关系和时间演化特性。

Method: 将微服务调用链抽象为有向图，使用图卷积聚合节点特征并建模依赖关系，引入门控循环单元建模时间演化，定义节点和路径级别的异常评分函数实现统一建模。

Conclusion: 为微服务异常检测提供了新的技术路径，为分布式系统智能运维奠定了方法论基础。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of anomaly detection and root cause tracing
in microservice architectures and proposes a unified framework that combines
graph neural networks with temporal modeling. The microservice call chain is
abstracted as a directed graph, where multidimensional features of nodes and
edges are used to construct a service topology representation, and graph
convolution is applied to aggregate features across nodes and model
dependencies, capturing complex structural relationships among services. On
this basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal
evolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations
are used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving
the ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring
functions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified
modeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which
enables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of
potential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed
from multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental
disturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results
show that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC,
Recall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic
topologies and complex environments. This research not only provides a new
technical path for anomaly detection in microservices but also lays a
methodological foundation for intelligent operations in distributed systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在求解偏微分方程时常常违反物理定律，如不守恒、熵条件破坏等，需要一种能确保物理可容许性的训练方法。

Method: CPL框架通过可微投影将网络输出映射到物理约束集合的交集上，结合总变差阻尼和滚动课程学习来稳定训练。

Result: 在Burgers和Euler系统上，CPL能产生稳定且物理合法的解，守恒律达到机器精度，总变差增长消失，熵和误差保持有界。

Conclusion: CPL使物理约束成为学习过程的内在属性，而不是依赖神经网络自发地尊重物理定律。

Abstract: Neural networks can approximate solutions to partial differential equations,
but they often break the very laws they are meant to model-creating mass from
nowhere, drifting shocks, or violating conservation and entropy. We address
this by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our
framework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update
physically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of
constraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and
positivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10%
computational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We
further stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small
oscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long
prediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft
violations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth
vanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems,
CPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy.
Instead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior
an intrinsic property of the learning process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SORTD是一个新颖的框架，用于高效枚举Rashomon集合中的稀疏决策树，按目标值排序，相比现有方法将运行时间减少最多两个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏决策树学习提供准确且可解释的预测模型，但单一"最佳"树可能无法满足所有需求。Rashomon集合包含性能相似但结构不同的树，可以增强变量重要性分析、丰富解释性，并允许用户根据偏好选择更简单或满足特定标准的树。

Method: 提出SORTD框架，支持按目标值顺序枚举Rashomon集合中的树，提供随时可用的行为。该框架适用于任何可分离和全序的目标函数，并支持使用其他可分离目标对集合进行后评估。

Result: 实验表明，SORTD相比现有技术将运行时间减少最多两个数量级，使Rashomon集合的探索在实际应用中更加可行。

Conclusion: SORTD通过提高可扩展性和支持多种目标函数，使Rashomon集合的探索在现实应用中更加实用，为高风险决策提供更丰富的模型选择。

Abstract: Sparse decision tree learning provides accurate and interpretable predictive
models that are ideal for high-stakes applications by finding the single most
accurate tree within a (soft) size limit. Rather than relying on a single
"best" tree, Rashomon sets-trees with similar performance but varying
structures-can be used to enhance variable importance analysis, enrich
explanations, and enable users to choose simpler trees or those that satisfy
stakeholder preferences (e.g., fairness) without hard-coding such criteria into
the objective function. However, because finding the optimal tree is NP-hard,
enumerating the Rashomon set is inherently challenging. Therefore, we introduce
SORTD, a novel framework that improves scalability and enumerates trees in the
Rashomon set in order of the objective value, thus offering anytime behavior.
Our experiments show that SORTD reduces runtime by up to two orders of
magnitude compared with the state of the art. Moreover, SORTD can compute
Rashomon sets for any separable and totally ordered objective and supports
post-evaluating the set using other separable (and partially ordered)
objectives. Together, these advances make exploring Rashomon sets more
practical in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需数据的多标签意图识别管道DMTC，通过提示工程生成合成查询、Sentence-T5编码和在线焦点对比损失训练，在交通领域应用中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: DMTC管道包含三个步骤：1) 使用提示工程指导LLM生成多样化合成查询；2) 用Sentence-T5模型编码文本查询获得语义嵌入；3) 使用新型在线焦点对比损失训练轻量级分类器。

Result: 在海上交通应用中，DMTC达到5.35%的汉明损失和95.92%的AUC，优于最先进的多标签分类器和LLM基线。Sentence-T5嵌入比替代编码器提升至少3.29%的子集准确率，OFC损失相比标准对比目标带来额外0.98%增益。

Conclusion: 该系统能够无缝地将用户查询路由到特定任务模块，为无需昂贵手动标注的完全自主意图感知智能体奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this study, a modular, data-free pipeline for multi-label intention
recognition is proposed for agentic AI applications in transportation. Unlike
traditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora
and often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach
eliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of
multi-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named
DMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different
transport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to
obtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using
a novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and
maximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline
is demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation
context. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%
and an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers
and recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that
Sentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over
alternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%
gain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system
seamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,
traffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation
domain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents
without costly manual labelling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数化后验校准方法基于逻辑回归，在理论和实践中都有良好基础，但多分类校准面临参数过多和校准数据有限导致的过拟合问题。

Method: 使用结构化正则化、鲁棒预处理和高效优化来管理多分类校准中的偏差-方差权衡，开发了比标准温度缩放更富有表达力的校准方法。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，所提出的方法在管理偏差-方差权衡方面表现优异，相比现有的逻辑回归校准技术取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 本文提供了高效易用的开源实现，使其成为温度缩放、向量缩放和矩阵缩放等常见校准方法的理想替代方案。

Abstract: Post-hoc recalibration methods are widely used to ensure that classifiers
provide faithful probability estimates. We argue that parametric recalibration
functions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple
theoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight
motivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard
temperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies
in the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often
coupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff
can be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing
and efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains
over existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and
easy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an
attractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling
implementations.

Motivation: 机器学习模型经济的发展使得训练数据集和预训练模型市场相互交织，但现有定价方法仍将数据和模型交易分离，或依赖偏向一方的代理中心管道，缺乏同时覆盖数据卖家、模型生产者和模型买家的对称机制。

Method: 通过供给端映射将数据集支付转换为买方可见的模型报价，需求端映射通过基于Shapley值的分配将买方价格传播回数据集，形成包含双向供需传播和买卖双方相互耦合的闭环系统。

Result: 实验证明该机制能有效收敛，与代理中心和单边基准相比提高了公平性，联合算子被证明是标准干扰函数，保证均衡价格的存在性、唯一性和全局收敛性。

Conclusion: 提出的统一数据-模型耦合市场解决了现有定价机制的局限性，实现了数据卖家、模型生产者和模型买家的三方共赢，代码已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: The rise of the machine learning (ML) model economy has intertwined markets
for training datasets and pre-trained models. However, most pricing approaches
still separate data and model transactions or rely on broker-centric pipelines
that favor one side. Recent studies of data markets with externalities capture
buyer interactions but do not yield a simultaneous and symmetric mechanism
across data sellers, model producers, and model buyers. We propose a unified
data-model coupled market that treats dataset and model trading as a single
system. A supply-side mapping transforms dataset payments into buyer-visible
model quotations, while a demand-side mapping propagates buyer prices back to
datasets through Shapley-based allocation. Together, they form a closed loop
that links four interactions: supply-demand propagation in both directions and
mutual coupling among buyers and among sellers. We prove that the joint
operator is a standard interference function (SIF), guaranteeing existence,
uniqueness, and global convergence of equilibrium prices. Experiments
demonstrate efficient convergence and improved fairness compared with
broker-centric and one-sided baselines. The code is available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟/混合信号电路设计仍主要依赖手工过程，存在设计周期长、易出错的问题。现有AI方法需要大量耗时仿真且缺乏可解释性，阻碍了工具的广泛应用。

Method: 采用多智能体工作流，专门的LLM智能体协作解释电路拓扑、理解设计目标，并通过可解释的推理迭代优化电路设计参数，结合自适应仿真策略实现高样本效率。

Result: 在两种不同复杂度的电路上验证了AnaFlow框架，能够完全自动完成尺寸优化任务，优于纯贝叶斯优化和强化学习方法，并能从优化历史中学习避免错误、加速收敛。

Conclusion: 该框架为模拟设计空间探索提供了强大工具，代表了模拟EDA的新范式，其中AI智能体作为透明的设计助手发挥作用。

Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the
physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,
resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of
AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to
automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical
bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of
explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of
the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for
sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs
a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based
agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design
goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the
target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation
strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.
The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity
and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from
pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system
learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate
convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog
design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents
serve as transparent design assistants.

TL;DR: POEMS是一个可解释的多组学集成框架，通过稀疏解码保持预测性能的同时提供可解释性，解决了深度生成模型中预测性能与可解释性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度生成模型在预测性能和可解释性之间存在权衡：要么牺牲可解释性追求预测性能，要么通过线性化解码器来强制可解释性但削弱非线性表达能力。需要克服这种权衡。

Method: 使用产品专家模型构建共享潜在空间，通过稀疏连接将特征映射到潜在因子，利用门控网络自适应计算各组学在表示学习中的贡献，并提出了高效的稀疏解码器。

Result: 在癌症亚型分型案例研究中，POEMS实现了具有竞争力的聚类和分类性能，同时提供了新颖的解释能力，证明基于生物标志物的洞察和预测准确性可以在多组学表示学习中并存。

Conclusion: POEMS框架成功展示了在多组学集成中，预测性能和可解释性可以共存，无需线性化网络任何部分，为生物标志物发现和跨组学关联分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Integrating different molecular layers, i.e., multiomics data, is crucial for
unraveling the complexity of diseases; yet, most deep generative models either
prioritize predictive performance at the expense of interpretability or enforce
interpretability by linearizing the decoder, thereby weakening the network's
nonlinear expressiveness. To overcome this tradeoff, we introduce POEMS:
Product Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics Integration using Sparse
Decoding, an unsupervised probabilistic framework that preserves predictive
performance while providing interpretability. POEMS provides interpretability
without linearizing any part of the network by 1) mapping features to latent
factors using sparse connections, which directly translates to biomarker
discovery, 2) allowing for cross-omic associations through a shared latent
space using product of experts model, and 3) reporting contributions of each
omic by a gating network that adaptively computes their influence in the
representation learning. Additionally, we present an efficient sparse decoder.
In a cancer subtyping case study, POEMS achieves competitive clustering and
classification performance while offering our novel set of interpretations,
demonstrating that biomarker based insight and predictive accuracy can coexist
in multiomics representation learning.

Motivation: 许多现实世界强化学习问题中的环境存在固有对称性，可以利用这些对称性来提高学习效率。

Method: 提出对称感知的乐观最小二乘值迭代方法，使用不变核在奖励和转移动态中编码不变性，并建立了不变RKHS的最大信息增益和覆盖数的新界限。

Result: 在定制Frozen Lake环境和2D布局设计问题上的实证结果表明，对称感知强化学习比标准核方法获得显著更好的性能。

Conclusion: 结构先验在设计更样本高效的强化学习算法中具有重要价值。

Abstract: In many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, the environment
exhibits inherent symmetries that can be exploited to improve learning
efficiency. This paper develops a theoretical and algorithmic framework for
incorporating known group symmetries into kernel-based RL. We propose a
symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI),
which leverages invariant kernels to encode invariance in both rewards and
transition dynamics. Our analysis establishes new bounds on the maximum
information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, explicitly
quantifying the sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results on a
customized Frozen Lake environment and a 2D placement design problem confirm
the theoretical improvements, demonstrating that symmetry-aware RL achieves
significantly better performance than their standard kernel counterparts. These
findings highlight the value of structural priors in designing more
sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: RAGBoost是一个高效的检索增强生成系统，通过准确性保持的上下文重用实现高缓存复用率，在不牺牲准确性的前提下将预填充性能提升1.5-3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成系统在预填充性能上存在瓶颈，特别是当应用需要处理更长、更复杂的输入时。现有的缓存技术要么保持准确性但缓存复用率低，要么提高复用率但牺牲推理质量。

Method: RAGBoost通过检测跨并发会话和多轮交互中重叠的检索项，使用高效的上下文索引、排序和去重技术来最大化复用，同时通过轻量级上下文提示保持推理保真度。

Result: RAGBoost与现有LLM推理引擎无缝集成，在多样化RAG和代理AI工作负载上，相比最先进方法将预填充性能提升1.5-3倍，同时保持甚至提高了推理准确性。

Conclusion: RAGBoost成功解决了RAG系统中缓存复用与准确性之间的权衡问题，为高效检索增强生成提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with retrieved context but often suffers from downgraded prefill performance as
modern applications demand longer and more complex inputs. Existing caching
techniques either preserve accuracy with low cache reuse or improve reuse at
the cost of degraded reasoning quality. We present RAGBoost, an efficient RAG
system that achieves high cache reuse without sacrificing accuracy through
accuracy-preserving context reuse. RAGBoost detects overlapping retrieved items
across concurrent sessions and multi-turn interactions, using efficient context
indexing, ordering, and de-duplication to maximize reuse, while lightweight
contextual hints maintain reasoning fidelity. It integrates seamlessly with
existing LLM inference engines and improves their prefill performance by 1.5-3X
over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving or even enhancing reasoning
accuracy across diverse RAG and agentic AI workloads. Our code is released at:

TL;DR: NAP是一个基于注意力的模型，通过三轴注意力机制聚合多通道预测，解决了多导睡眠图信号异质性问题，在零样本泛化方面达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多导睡眠图信号存在高度异质性，包括模态组成、通道可用性和采集协议的差异。现有模型通常依赖固定的模态或通道子集，未能充分利用其多模态特性。

Method: 提出NAP模型，使用三轴注意力机制（时间、空间、预测器级别）来学习组合多个预测流，通过聚合冻结的预训练单通道模型输出，适应不同的输入维度。

Result: NAP持续优于单个预测器和简单集成方法，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的零样本泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法虽然针对自动睡眠分期开发，但可扩展到其他多模态生理应用领域。

Abstract: Polysomnography signals are highly heterogeneous, varying in modality
composition (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG), channel availability (e.g., frontal,
occipital EEG), and acquisition protocols across datasets and clinical sites.
Most existing models that process polysomnography data rely on a fixed subset
of modalities or channels and therefore neglect to fully exploit its inherently
multimodal nature. We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural
Aggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine
multiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures
temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to
different input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained
single-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and
simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across
multiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging
from polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other
multimodal physiological applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为最近在LLM数学推理中观察到的矛盾筛选策略提供了原则性解释，揭示了数据筛选改善泛化的条件和机制。

Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework to resolve a central paradox in
modern machine learning: When is it better to use less data? This question has
become critical as classical scaling laws suggesting ``more is more'' (Sun et
al., 2025) are challenged by methods like LIMO (``less is more'') and s1 (Ye et
al., 2025; Muenighoff et al., 2025), which achieve superior performance with
small, aggressively curated datasets. Here, we study data curation strategies
where an imperfect oracle selects the training examples according to their
difficulty and correctness. Our results provide exact scaling law curves for
test error under both label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules, revealing
when and why keeping only a subset of data can improve generalization. In
contrast to classical scaling laws, we show that under certain conditions,
small curated datasets can outperform full datasets, and we provide analytical
conditions for this by deriving precise phase transition curves tied to data
size and quality. We validate these theoretical claims with empirical results
on ImageNet, confirming our predictions about when curation improves accuracy
and can even mitigate model collapse. Furthermore, our framework provides a
principled explanation for the contradictory curation strategies recently
observed in LLM mathematical reasoning.

Motivation: 研究GRPO这种无需学习critic的策略优化方法是否能在经典RL环境中替代PPO，探索学习baseline在策略梯度方法中的必要性。

Method: 在经典单任务RL环境中系统研究GRPO，通过控制变量实验分离baseline、折扣因子和分组采样等因素的影响。

Result: 1) 除CartPole等短时域任务外，所有无critic方法均不如PPO；2) GRPO适合高折扣因子(0.99)，但HalfCheetah适合中等折扣(0.9)；3) 小分组优于大分组。

Conclusion: 揭示了无critic方法在经典控制任务中的局限性，以及它们在特定条件下仍可作为学习价值函数替代方案的可行性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable
alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the learned
critic and instead estimating advantages through group-relative comparisons of
trajectories. This simplification raises fundamental questions about the
necessity of learned baselines in policy-gradient methods. We present the first
systematic study of GRPO in classical single-task reinforcement learning
environments, spanning discrete and continuous control tasks. Through
controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we
reveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for
long-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in
short-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be
effective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except
in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting
(gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting
limitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes.
These results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical
control and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to
learned value functions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model without sharing their private data. However, the presence of malicious
(Byzantine) clients poses significant challenges to the robustness of FL,
particularly when data distributions across clients are heterogeneous. In this
paper, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust FL optimization problem that
incorporates adaptive weighting into the aggregation process. Unlike
conventional approaches, our formulation treats aggregation weights as
learnable parameters, jointly optimizing them alongside the global model
parameters. To solve this optimization problem, we develop an alternating
minimization algorithm with strong convergence guarantees under adversarial
attack. We analyze the Byzantine resilience of the proposed objective. We
evaluate the performance of our algorithm against state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust FL approaches across various datasets and attack scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing approaches, particularly in settings with highly heterogeneous data
and a large proportion of malicious clients.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在随机凸优化设置中平坦最小值与泛化性能之间的关系，发现平坦最小值可能泛化性能较差，而尖锐最小值反而泛化更好。同时分析了两种锐度感知算法的泛化表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解学习算法的泛化行为是学习理论的核心目标。最近的研究表明学习算法在实践中成功是因为它们收敛到平坦最小值，这与改进的泛化性能相关。本文旨在研究在随机凸优化设置中平坦最小值与泛化之间的确切联系。

Method: 在非负β平滑目标的随机凸优化框架下，分析平坦最小值与尖锐最小值的泛化性能。研究了两种锐度感知算法：锐度感知梯度下降(SA-GD)和锐度感知最小化(SAM)，使用算法稳定性技术建立风险上界。

Result: 发现平坦经验最小值可能产生Ω(1)的总体风险，而尖锐最小值反而能最优泛化。SA-GD虽然快速收敛到平坦最小值，但总体风险仍可能高达Ω(1)。SAM虽然最小化经验损失，但可能收敛到尖锐最小值且总体风险为Ω(1)。

Conclusion: 在随机凸优化设置中，平坦最小值与良好泛化性能之间的关联并不总是成立，平坦最小值可能泛化性能差，而尖锐最小值反而泛化更好。锐度感知算法在理论上不能保证找到泛化性能好的解。

Abstract: Understanding the generalization behavior of learning algorithms is a central
goal of learning theory. A recently emerging explanation is that learning
algorithms are successful in practice because they converge to flat minima,
which have been consistently associated with improved generalization
performance. In this work, we study the link between flat minima and
generalization in the canonical setting of stochastic convex optimization with
a non-negative, $\beta$-smooth objective. Our first finding is that, even in
this fundamental and well-studied setting, flat empirical minima may incur
trivial $\Omega(1)$ population risk while sharp minima generalizes optimally.
Then, we show that this poor generalization behavior extends to two natural
''sharpness-aware'' algorithms originally proposed by Foret et al. (2021),
designed to bias optimization toward flat solutions: Sharpness-Aware Gradient
Descent (SA-GD) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). For SA-GD, which
performs gradient steps on the maximal loss in a predefined neighborhood, we
prove that while it successfully converges to a flat minimum at a fast rate,
the population risk of the solution can still be as large as $\Omega(1)$,
indicating that even flat minima found algorithmically using a sharpness-aware
gradient method might generalize poorly. For SAM, a computationally efficient
approximation of SA-GD based on normalized ascent steps, we show that although
it minimizes the empirical loss, it may converge to a sharp minimum and also
incur population risk $\Omega(1)$. Finally, we establish population risk upper
bounds for both SA-GD and SAM using algorithmic stability techniques.

Result: 在语义丰富的基准测试中，TabGemma在分类任务（低数据和高数据场景）中达到新的SOTA，且性能随上下文行数单调提升；在回归任务中，小样本时具有竞争力，但数据增长时落后传统方法。

Conclusion: LLMs在配备专用数字处理和上下文检索时，可以成为语义丰富表格任务的有效的上下文内学习器，但需要在数字建模和长上下文扩展方面进一步改进。

that treats rows as sequences and tackles two practical hurdles when adapting
pretrained LLMs for tabular predictions: unstable numeric tokenization and
limited context size. We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific
notation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target
imputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we
use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit
within a 128k-token window.
  On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art
on classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically
with more context rows. For regression, it is competitive at small sample sizes
but trails conventional approaches as data grows. Our results show that LLMs
can be effective tabular in-context learners on highly semantic tasks when
paired with dedicated numeric handling and context retrieval, while motivating
further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.

*Junyi Wu,Dan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL)方法，通过改进的低秩张量分解和探索机制，在高维强化学习中提升样本效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维强化学习面临计算复杂和样本效率低的问题，传统Q学习算法受维度诅咒影响，而神经网络方法虽然成功但参数效率不高。张量方法提供了更参数高效的替代方案。

Method: TEQL通过改进的块坐标下降在离散化状态-动作空间上进行低秩张量分解，结合了基于近似误差和访问次数的探索策略，以及频率惩罚项来鼓励探索较少访问的状态-动作对。

Result: 在经典控制任务上的实验结果表明，TEQL在样本效率和总奖励方面优于传统矩阵方法和深度RL方法。

Conclusion: TEQL适用于资源受限的应用场景，如空间和医疗领域，其中采样成本较高。

Abstract: High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex
calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning
algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the
number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While
neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent
tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more
parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods,
we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor
decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action
spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key
innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with
visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high
uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate
a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage
exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to
frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks
demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL
approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for
resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling
costs are high.

*Iason Chrysomallis,Georgios Chalkiadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度隐式模仿强化学习框架，结合深度强化学习和仅观察数据集的隐式模仿学习，解决了传统模仿学习需要完整状态-动作演示和最优专家的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习需要完整的状态-动作演示和最优专家，这严重限制了实际应用，因为许多现实场景只提供状态观察而没有相应动作，且专家表现往往次优。

Method: 主要算法DIIQN采用动作推断机制通过在线探索重建专家动作，并集成动态置信机制自适应平衡专家引导和自主学习。HA-DIIQN算法处理专家和智能体具有不同动作集的情况，引入不可行性检测机制和桥接过程。

Result: DIIQN相比标准DQN实现高达130%的更高回合回报，持续优于现有无法超越专家表现的隐式模仿方法。在异构动作设置中，HA-DIIQN学习速度比基线快64%，能够利用传统方法无法使用的专家数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架在不同数据集大小和超参数配置下表现出鲁棒性，能够利用专家指导加速训练，同时保持超越次优专家表现的能力。

Abstract: Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action
demonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements
severely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide
only state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is
often suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation
reinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining
deep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from
observation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation
Q-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs
expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence
mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.
This enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training
while maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further
extend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to
tackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a
challenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.
HA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging
procedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to
expert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental
results demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns
compared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit
imitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous
action settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging
expert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter
sensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset
sizes and hyperparameter configurations.

Method: 基于Robbins-Siegmund定理的统一框架，使用Lean 4定理证明器进行形式化验证

Result: 成功形式化验证了Q学习和线性TD学习在马尔可夫样本下的几乎必然收敛性

Conclusion: 这项工作为完全形式化收敛RL结果迈出了重要一步，所开发的框架可以轻松扩展到收敛速率和其他收敛模式

Abstract: In this paper, we formalize the almost sure convergence of $Q$-learning and
linear temporal difference (TD) learning with Markovian samples using the Lean
4 theorem prover based on the Mathlib library. $Q$-learning and linear TD are
among the earliest and most influential reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.
The investigation of their convergence properties is not only a major research
topic during the early development of the RL field but also receives increasing
attention nowadays. This paper formally verifies their almost sure convergence
in a unified framework based on the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. The framework
developed in this work can be easily extended to convergence rates and other
modes of convergence. This work thus makes an important step towards fully
formalizing convergent RL results. The code is available at

Abstract: Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN have revolutionized predictive
machine learning for tabular data. At the same time, the driving factors of
this revolution are hard to understand. Existing open-source tabular foundation
models are implemented in complicated pipelines boasting over 10,000 lines of
code, lack architecture documentation or code quality. In short, the
implementations are hard to understand, not beginner-friendly, and complicated
to adapt for new experiments. We introduce nanoTabPFN, a simplified and
lightweight implementation of the TabPFN v2 architecture and a corresponding
training loop that uses pre-generated training data. nanoTabPFN makes tabular
foundation models more accessible to students and researchers alike. For
example, restricted to a small data setting it achieves a performance
comparable to traditional machine learning baselines within one minute of
pre-training on a single GPU (160,000x faster than TabPFN v2 pretraining). This
eliminated requirement of large computational resources makes pre-training
tabular foundation models accessible for educational purposes. Our code is

Abstract: The integration of IoT devices in healthcare introduces significant security
and reliability challenges, increasing susceptibility to cyber threats and
operational anomalies. This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework
for (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device
anomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning
models are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning
(XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised
learning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph
Neural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The
comprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score,
precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost
achieved 99\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly
detection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively.
LSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For
attack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score
with the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy.
GAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC.
These findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective
anomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and
device failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches,
minimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of
medical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven
healthcare solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAQ框架通过行为一致性信号实现从离线到在线强化学习的平滑过渡，利用离线数据中的隐式行为模型在在线微调期间提供指导，减少分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习策略在动态环境中部署时，由于分布偏移和未见状态-动作对上的不可靠价值估计而表现不佳，需要一种平滑可靠的离线到在线过渡方法。

Method: BAQ采用双目标损失函数：(i)在不确定性高时使在线策略向离线行为对齐；(ii)随着在线经验积累逐渐放松约束，通过自适应机制减少误差传播。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BAQ持续优于先前的离线到在线强化学习方法，实现了更快的恢复速度、改进的鲁棒性和更高的整体性能。

Conclusion: 隐式行为适应是现实世界策略部署的一个原则性和实用解决方案，能够实现可靠的策略部署。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables training from fixed data without
online interaction, but policies learned offline often struggle when deployed
in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value
estimates on unseen state-action pairs. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive
Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable
transition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit
behavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency
signal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that
(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is
high, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online
experience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation
from out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and
accelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ
consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving
faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our
results demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and
practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于收缩估计的基线方法，用于改进强化学习中验证奖励的方差估计，特别是在低生成数量的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用每个提示的样本均值作为基线来减少策略梯度估计的方差，但在低生成数量的情况下估计不准确。受Stein悖论启发，作者希望通过结合每个提示和跨提示的均值来改进基线估计。

Method: 提出收缩估计器，将每个提示的样本均值和跨提示的均值进行组合，构建一个基于收缩的基线，作为现有每个提示均值基线的直接替代方案。

Result: 理论上证明了收缩基线能够产生更低方差的策略梯度估计器。实证结果显示收缩基线持续优于标准样本均值基线，导致梯度更新的方差更低和训练稳定性提高。

Conclusion: 收缩基线是一种无需额外超参数或计算的有效方法，能够显著改进强化学习训练中的方差估计和稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using
policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods
typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each
prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),
reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.
  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages
for each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we
propose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt
means to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --
particularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we
construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance
policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a
drop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no
additional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines
consistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to
lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.
