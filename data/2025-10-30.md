### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DrivingScene框架，仅用两个连续环视图像在线重建4D动态驾驶场景，通过轻量级残差流网络预测动态物体非刚性运动，在nuScenes数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时高保真重建动态驾驶场景面临复杂动态和稀疏视图的挑战，现有方法难以平衡质量和效率。

Method: 使用轻量级残差流网络在学习的静态场景先验上预测动态物体的非刚性运动，通过场景流显式建模动态，并采用从粗到精的训练范式避免端到端方法的不稳定性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，仅使用图像的方法能在线生成高质量深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，在动态重建和新视角合成方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DrivingScene框架成功解决了动态驾驶场景重建中质量与效率的平衡问题，为实时4D场景重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M-ACM模型，通过运动感知解码增强视频描述质量，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示来突出人体动态，减少幻觉并提高语义保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频描述方法难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致描述模糊或语义不一致

Method: 引入运动增强描述模型(M-ACM)，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示进行运动感知解码，创建HMI数据集和HMI-Bench基准

Result: M-ACM在准确描述复杂人体运动和细微时间变化方面显著优于先前方法

Conclusion: M-ACM为运动中心视频描述设立了新标准

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Learning Disentangled Speech- and Expression-Driven Blendshapes for 3D Talking Face Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25234)
*Yuxiang Mao,Zhijie Zhang,Zhiheng Zhang,Jiawei Liu,Chen Zeng,Shihong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音和情感驱动的3D面部动画方法，通过线性加性建模和稀疏约束损失，在保持准确口型同步的同时生成具有情感表达力的说话人脸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容快速发展，但真实且富有情感表达的3D面部动画仍然不足，主要障碍是真实情感3D说话人脸数据集的稀缺性。

Method: 将面部动画建模为语音和情感的线性加性问题，利用中性表情的3D说话人脸数据集和3D表情序列数据集，通过稀疏约束损失联合学习语音和情感驱动的混合形状，并将其映射到FLAME模型参数。

Result: 定性定量实验表明，该方法能自然地生成具有指定表情的说话人脸，同时保持准确的口型同步。感知研究显示，相比现有方法，本方法在情感表达力方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了情感表达与口型同步的平衡问题，为生成富有情感表达的3D说话人脸提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

### [4] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合两种不同SAR模拟器（MOCEM和Salsa）来生成合成数据集的方法，以解决合成孔径雷达图像自动目标识别中合成数据与真实数据之间的领域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏真实标记的SAR测量数据，需要使用合成数据训练深度学习模型，但基于简化物理模型的模拟器生成的数据与真实测量存在差异，导致模型泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合基于散射中心模型的MOCEM模拟器和基于光线追踪策略的Salsa模拟器，使用ADASCA深度学习方法来训练ATR模型。

Result: 在MSTAR真实测量数据上达到了接近88%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过结合不同模拟范式的SAR模拟器，可以有效提升合成数据训练模型在真实SAR图像上的自动目标识别性能。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [5] [FreeArt3D: Training-Free Articulated Object Generation using 3D Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25765)
*Chuhao Chen,Isabella Liu,Xinyue Wei,Hao Su,Minghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D是一个无需训练的可动3D物体生成框架，通过将预训练的静态3D扩散模型重新用作形状先验，将评分蒸馏采样扩展到3D到4D领域，将关节运动视为额外的生成维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可动3D物体建模方法要么需要密集视角监督的优化重建流程，要么只能生成粗糙几何近似且忽略表面纹理。虽然静态3D生成取得了显著成功，但将其扩展到可动物体面临重大挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的静态3D扩散模型作为形状先验，将评分蒸馏采样扩展到3D到4D领域，将关节运动作为额外生成维度。给定不同关节状态下拍摄的几张图像，联合优化物体的几何、纹理和关节参数。

Result: 生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测底层运动学结构，在多样化物体类别上泛化良好。尽管采用逐实例优化范式，但能在几分钟内完成，在质量和多功能性上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D提供了一个无需训练的可动3D生成解决方案，成功将静态3D扩散模型重新用于可动物体生成，在关节3D物体建模方面取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

### [6] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的移动激光扫描点云不确定性评估框架，使用随机森林和XGBoost模型，通过局部几何特征预测点级误差，实现无需高精度参考数据的可扩展不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后向不确定性建模依赖高精度参考数据，成本高且难以大规模获取。需要一种无需参考数据的可扩展不确定性评估方法。

Method: 使用随机森林和XGBoost集成学习模型，学习局部几何特征与点级误差的关系，采用空间分区数据集避免数据泄露。

Result: 两个模型都能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87。高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂度是预测不确定性的关键特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模点云质量控制和误差分析提供了数据驱动、可扩展且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [7] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，结合眼动追踪和面部特征进行阿尔茨海默病检测，通过交叉注意力机制和方向感知卷积实现自适应多模态表示学习，在自建数据集上达到95.11%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对及时干预至关重要。眼动追踪和面部特征作为认知功能的重要指标，但少有研究探索它们的联合集成用于辅助AD诊断。

Method: 提出多模态交叉增强融合框架，包含两个关键模块：交叉增强融合注意力模块（CEFAM）通过交叉注意力和全局增强建模模态间交互；方向感知卷积模块（DACM）通过水平-垂直感受野捕获细粒度方向性面部特征。

Result: 在包含25名AD患者和25名健康对照的自建同步多模态数据集上，该框架优于传统的晚期融合和特征拼接方法，在区分AD与HC时达到95.11%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模模态间依赖关系和模态特定贡献，该框架在阿尔茨海默病检测中表现出优越的鲁棒性和诊断性能。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads

FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [9] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ESCA框架，通过后训练量化和定制硬件加速器优化Codec Avatar模型，在VR设备上实现实时高保真渲染


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Codec Avatar模型在资源受限的VR设备上计算需求大、实时推理困难的问题

Method: 采用后训练量化方法降低模型精度，设计定制硬件加速器集成到VR设备SoC中，构建完整的优化框架

Result: FovVideoVDP质量评分比最佳4位基线提高+0.39，延迟降低3.36倍，端到端测试中维持100fps渲染速率

Conclusion: 证明了在资源受限设备上部署高保真Codec Avatar的可行性，为更沉浸式和便携的VR体验打开了大门

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [10] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视觉模型在图理解任务中的潜力，发现其性能可与图神经网络相媲美，但在全局结构理解方面表现更优。作者提出了GraphAbstract基准来评估模型感知全局图属性的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络采用自下而上的消息传递机制，与人类视觉感知先捕捉全局结构的方式存在根本差异。现有基准测试混淆了领域特征与拓扑理解，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 引入GraphAbstract基准，评估模型识别组织原型、检测对称性、感知连接强度和识别关键元素等全局图属性的能力。

Result: 视觉模型在需要整体结构理解的任务上显著优于图神经网络，且在不同图规模下保持泛化能力；而图神经网络在全局模式抽象方面表现不佳，且随着图规模增大性能下降。

Conclusion: 视觉模型具有显著但未被充分利用的图结构理解能力，特别是在需要全局拓扑感知和尺度不变推理的问题上。这为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

### [11] [A Re-node Self-training Approach for Deep Graph-based Semi-supervised Classification on Multi-view Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24791)
*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RSGSLM方法，结合图卷积网络、伪标签和拓扑平衡校正，用于多视图数据的半监督学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多视图图像数据时，由于缺乏清晰的图结构和多视图数据的复杂性，效率受限。多视图数据的图结构整合仍具挑战性。

Method: 结合线性特征变换和多视图图融合于GCN框架；动态将伪标签纳入GCN损失函数；通过调整类边界附近标记样本权重来校正拓扑不平衡；引入适用于所有样本的无监督平滑损失

Result: 在多视图基准图像数据集上的实验表明，RSGSLM在多视图场景下超越了现有的半监督学习方法

Conclusion: RSGSLM方法通过优化图结构整合和伪标签利用，在保持计算效率的同时提升了多视图半监督学习的性能

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench是一个多语言视觉语言基准测试，基于专家创建的PISA测试构建，包含6种语言的高质量人工验证数据，用于评估多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基准测试存在高质量人工验证样本有限、依赖LLM合成内容、多语言覆盖不足等问题，需要构建更可靠的多语言评估资源。

Method: 从PISA测试中提取人工标注的指令、问题、选项和图像，添加问题类型分类，并将英语样本翻译成西班牙语、德语、中文、法语和意大利语，构建完全平行的六语言语料库。

Result: 评估发现小模型（<200亿参数）在PISA-Bench上表现不佳，非英语版本性能显著下降，在空间和几何推理任务上错误率很高。

Conclusion: PISA-Bench为多语言多模态推理研究提供了重要资源，揭示了当前模型在跨语言理解和复杂推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [15] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap提出了一种双检索机制，通过图像到图像检索生成视觉提示来增强视觉表示，解决了现有方法仅使用文本提示造成的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征未被增强，特别是在对象细节和复杂场景方面存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 采用双检索机制：标准图像到文本检索用于文本提示，新颖的图像到图像检索用于获取视觉相似场景。从视觉相似场景的标题中提取关键词语和短语，通过轻量级可训练特征融合网络将文本特征与原始图像特征集成。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持竞争力的性能的同时，相比之前的视觉提示描述方法需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualCap通过视觉提示增强和双检索机制有效提升了图像描述的质量，同时保持了模型的轻量级特性。

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、耗时和不一致的问题，现有深度学习方法在准确性和特征透明度方面仍有挑战。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 微调五种先进视觉架构；2) 提取多级深度特征训练七个传统分类器；3) 使用LGBM、随机森林和Lasso进行特征选择。

Result: 最佳配置（Swin-Tiny特征+Extra Trees分类器+LGBM特征选择）在FFE数据集上达到85.99%准确率，比现有研究提升8.69-22.78%。

Conclusion: 该框架在视觉质量评估任务中表现出有效性和泛化能力，为鱼类新鲜度评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: 该基准测试为未来MLLMs在视频假新闻检测领域的评估和发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的安全方法存在过度拒绝和安全与效用不平衡的问题，需要更有效的安全对齐方案。

Method: 采用后验安全编辑范式，构建多轮图像-文本交错数据集MR-SafeEdit，开发统一的MLLM SafeEditor进行多轮安全编辑。

Result: 实验结果表明SafeEditor优于现有安全方法，减少了过度拒绝，实现了更好的安全-效用平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的多轮安全编辑框架为文本到图像模型提供了模型无关、即插即用的安全对齐解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Motivation: 多模态情感识别在人机交互中很重要，但由于不同模态间的差异和单模态情感信息表征困难，准确的情感识别仍面临挑战。

Method: 为每个模态构建对抗自编码器（AAE）学习情感特征，使用跨模态门机制（CGMM）减少模态差异并建立情感关系，最后通过特征融合模块（FFM）进行多模态融合。

Result: 在公开数据集SIMS和MOSI上的实验表明，MCIHN取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: MCIHN模型能有效解决多模态情感识别中的模态差异问题，提升情感识别准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Method: 建立流匹配模型与去噪器的形式化联系，设计原则性扰动（噪声和漂移）来影响样本生成，分析生成过程的不同动态阶段。

Result: 揭示了生成过程的独特动态阶段，能够精确描述去噪器在生成过程的哪个阶段成功或失败，以及这为什么重要。

Conclusion: 通过去噪视角为流匹配生成过程提供了新的理解框架，有助于深入分析生成质量的关键因素。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种连续概率性成熟度估计方法，通过改进RT-DETRv2目标检测器，引入概率头来预测水果蔬菜的连续成熟度分布，解决了传统离散分类方法的信息损失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法将成熟度作为离散分类问题处理，这与生物成熟过程的连续性本质相冲突，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊。

Method: 对最先进的实时目标检测器RT-DETRv2进行架构改进，引入专用的概率头，使模型能够为每个检测到的对象预测成熟度谱上的连续分布，同时学习平均成熟状态及其相关不确定性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的大规模水果数据集上实现了85.6%的平均精度(mAP)，同时提供了比基于分类方法更细粒度和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 概率性方法为现代农业提供了更智能、不确定性感知的自动化系统，能够提供更丰富和生物学上更合理的植物成熟度表示。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Conclusion: 精心选择关键点结合简单插值技术可实现高效准确的手语识别，为可扩展的手语识别系统铺平道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型难以处理非常规相机运动，因为缺乏足够的训练数据。需要找到替代方案来学习复杂相机运动。

Method: 使用合成视频训练扩散模型，采用多种解耦策略将相机运动学习与合成外观伪影分离，确保更鲁棒的运动表示并缓解领域偏移。

Result: 该方法能够合成广泛精确控制的复杂相机运动，仅需使用基本几何体在低多边形3D场景中的简单合成数据。

Conclusion: VividCam证明了从合成数据学习复杂相机运动的可行性，为创造性视频生成提供了新途径。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态学习中，主导模态往往会压制其他模态，限制了模型的泛化能力。需要一种方法来平衡各模态的贡献，增强模型的鲁棒性。

Method: M-SAM框架包含三个步骤：1) 使用Shapley值识别主导模态；2) 分解损失景观，调整损失以优先考虑主导模态的鲁棒性；3) 通过调制梯度的反向传播更新权重。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的实验表明，M-SAM优于最新的优化和梯度操作方法，显著平衡和改进了多模态学习性能。

Conclusion: M-SAM是一个模型无关的框架，能够有效平衡多模态学习，增强主导模态的鲁棒性同时提升其他模态的贡献，支持早期和晚期融合场景。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Motivation: Wi-Fi感知因其低成本、非侵入式特性在医疗保健、空间占用分析和手势控制等应用中具有潜力，但普遍存在过拟合问题，模型在训练数据上表现良好但泛化能力差。

Method: 开发了IBIS混合架构，集成Inception-BiLSTM和SVM，旨在提高模型泛化能力并创建更鲁棒的分类边界。该方法应用于多普勒衍生数据。

Conclusion: IBIS方法成功解决了Wi-Fi感知中的过拟合问题，提供了强大的泛化能力和鲁棒的分类性能。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

TL;DR: FT-ARM是一种基于多模态大语言模型的压力性溃疡严重程度分类方法，通过微调和自我反思机制，在PIID数据集上达到85%准确率，比传统CNN方法提升4%，并提供临床可解释的自然语言解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力性溃疡严重程度分类具有挑战性，现有AI方法准确率有限且缺乏可解释性，需要开发更可靠、透明且适用于临床应用的自动伤口评估系统。

Method: 基于LLaMA 3.2 90B微调的多模态大语言模型，结合代理式自我反思机制，通过迭代推理视觉特征和编码的临床知识来优化预测。

Result: 在Pressure Injury Image Dataset上，FT-ARM对I-IV期压力性溃疡的分类准确率达到85%，比之前的CNN模型提升4%，并支持实时推理和临床可解释性。

Conclusion: FT-ARM通过整合微调和多模态输入的反思推理，提高了自动伤口评估系统的可靠性、透明度和临床应用性，满足了压力性溃疡分期一致性和可解释性的关键需求。

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLOv8和半监督学习的车牌识别系统，结合人工标注和Grounding DINO生成的伪标签，在多个数据集上取得高召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高精度自动车牌识别系统面临环境因素（光照、雨、灰尘）、车辆高速、摄像头角度变化和图像质量差等挑战，该系统在交通控制、停车管理、车辆追踪等领域有重要应用价值。

Method: 使用YOLOv8进行车牌检测和识别，采用半监督学习框架，结合少量人工标注数据和Grounding DINO生成的伪标签来训练检测模型，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法只能突出目标的最具区分性区域，无法覆盖完整对象且边界不准确，这限制了弱监督语义分割等下游任务的性能。

Method: Region-CAM通过提取语义信息图(SIMs)和执行语义信息传播(SIP)，考虑基线分类模型各阶段的梯度和特征来生成激活图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上，Region-CAM达到60.12%和58.43%的mIoU，比原始CAM提升13.61%和13.13%；在MS COCO上达到36.38% mIoU，提升16.23%；在ILSVRC2012上达到51.7%的Top-1定位精度，比LayerCAM提升4.5%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM能够突出更大比例的对象区域，同时确保激活图具有精确的边界，在弱监督学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited

architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at

Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

Motivation: 现有城市场景重建方法依赖多模态传感器（LiDAR和图像），但获取准确的LiDAR数据存在挑战：需要精确的时空标定，且传感器位置差异会导致重投影误差

Conclusion: D²GS框架证明了无需LiDAR即可实现高质量城市场景重建的可行性，通过创新的深度增强和几何优化策略，在几何精度上甚至超越了依赖LiDAR的方法

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Motivation: 传统语义分割方法使用固定参数分类器，无法适应每张图像不同的类别分布，且数据集级别的类别不平衡会导致分割结果偏向多数类别，限制了模型对少数类别区域的识别能力。

Method: 提出ECAC分类器，利用内存库学习数据集级别的上下文信息，并结合当前图像的类别特定上下文信息来改进分类器。采用教师-学生网络范式，教师网络使用真实标签动态调整上下文信息并将知识传递给学生网络。

Result: 在ADE20K、COCO-Stuff10K和Pascal-Context等多个数据集上的综合实验表明，ECAC能够实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ECAC通过动态调整分类器参数，有效解决了语义分割中的类别分布差异和类别不平衡问题，提升了模型的整体性能。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood

and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based

Conclusion: U-CAN框架在无需干净数据监督的情况下实现了高质量去噪，其一致性约束具有通用性，可扩展到2D图像去噪领域。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过多阶段特征提取和选择性更新策略，结合特征融合，有效提升了光度立体法的性能。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了深度学习在农业景观中森林外树木分类的应用，比较了多种神经网络架构，发现FT-UNetFormer模型表现最佳，强调了空间上下文理解的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 森林外树木在农业景观中具有重要生态功能，但现有研究多将其视为单一类别或依赖刚性阈值，限制了生态解释和跨区域适应性。

Method: 使用德国四个农业景观的高分辨率航空影像和新生成的数据集，比较了CNN、视觉变换器和混合CNN-变换器模型在六种语义分割架构上的表现，分类四种木质植被类别。

Result: 模型在四个景观中均取得良好分类精度，FT-UNetFormer表现最佳（平均IoU 0.74；平均F1分数0.84），森林和线性类别结果良好，但复杂结构（特别是斑块和单树类别）分类存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究强调了空间上下文理解在TOF制图分类中的重要性，泛化实验显示需要区域多样化的训练数据以确保可靠的大规模制图。

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Motivation: 轻量级目标检测器在追求高速推理时往往导致特征表示能力下降，限制了性能提升和实际部署。需要一种有效的方法来增强轻量级检测器的特征表示能力。

Method: 1. 深度语义注入器(DSI)：将视觉基础模型的高级表示集成到检测器深层；2. 梯度引导自适应调制(GAM)：基于梯度范数比动态调整语义传递强度。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时目标检测提供了一种成本效益高且高度适应的蒸馏框架，能够在不增加部署和推理开销的情况下显著提升性能。

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

TL;DR: LangHOPS是首个基于多模态大语言模型的开集对象-部件实例分割框架，能够联合检测和分割层次化的对象和部件实例，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或可学习的视觉分组，而LangHOPS旨在将对象-部件层次结构建立在语言空间中，利用MLLM的丰富知识和推理能力来链接层次结构中的多粒度概念。

Method: 将MLLM集成到对象-部件解析流程中，利用语言锚定的层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化策略，实现开集对象和部件实例的联合检测与分割。

Result: 在PartImageNet数据集上，LangHOPS比先前方法在域内和跨数据集对象-部件实例分割中分别提升5.5%和4.8% AP；在ADE20K的零样本语义分割中，对未见对象部件提升2.5% mIOU。

Conclusion: LangHOPS证明了基于语言空间的层次结构表示和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化的有效性，为开集对象-部件实例分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有SFDA方法在域差异较大时面临的挑战：非生成方法伪标签不可靠，生成方法在创建伪源数据时域差异扩大

Method: 将目标样本分为可信集和非可信集，对非可信集样本使用潜在扩散模型进行语义转换并保持目标分布，设计渐进式精炼机制迭代减小伪目标域与真实目标域的差异

Result: 在四个主流SFDA基准数据集上大幅超越现有方法，在源-目标域差异大的场景下性能提升高达18.6%

Conclusion: DPTM通过可靠生成和渐进精炼伪目标域，有效解决了源自由域自适应中的域差异限制问题，为SFDA提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

TL;DR: GaTector+是一个统一的框架，用于视线目标检测和视线跟随，消除了推理过程中对头部相关先验知识的依赖，通过共享主干网络和特定块来处理子任务特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分别处理视线目标检测和视线跟随任务，且预测依赖于头部相关先验知识，需要辅助网络提取头部位置，限制了系统联合优化和实际应用。

Method: 使用扩展的特定-通用-特定特征提取器，共享主干网络提取通用特征，前后使用特定块处理子任务特异性；嵌入头部检测分支预测头部位置；提出基于头部的注意力机制融合感知特征和视线特征；引入注意力监督机制加速视线热图学习；提出新的评估指标mSoC。

Conclusion: GaTector+通过消除对头部先验知识的依赖，实现了视线目标检测和视线跟随的统一框架，提高了系统的联合优化能力和实际应用性。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 解决紧凑型RGBD成像的双重挑战：传统紧凑光学系统难以在整个景深范围内保持RGB清晰度，而纯软件单目深度估计依赖不可靠的语义先验且是病态问题。

Method: 引入仿生全球面单中心透镜，建立严格的物理前向模型生成合成数据集，并与双头多尺度重建网络协同设计，共享编码器联合恢复全焦图像和深度图。

Result: 深度估计达到Abs Rel 0.026和RMSE 0.130，显著优于纯软件方法和其他深度光学系统；图像恢复达到SSIM 0.960和LPIPS 0.082。

Conclusion: 仿生全球面光学与联合重建算法的结合是解决高性能紧凑RGBD成像内在挑战的有效策略。

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本目标检测在只有少量新类样本可用时，容易受到基类偏见和不稳定校准的影响。

Method: PDA在DeFRCN框架中提供基于原型的"第二意见"，维护支持集原型在可学习的投影空间中，采用EMA更新原型，使用best-of-K匹配方案和温度缩放融合来结合度量相似性和检测器logits。

Result: 在VOC FSOD和GFSOD基准测试中，PDA一致地提高了新类性能，对基类影响最小，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: PDA是一种有效的轻量级解决方案，能够显著提升少样本目标检测的新类性能，同时保持协议合规性和计算效率。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: MMEdge通过流水线设计和自适应优化，有效解决了边缘设备上多模态推理的延迟和精度平衡问题，为实时应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT数据集解决了视频问答中时间演化和推理过程标注的关键问题，推动了流式视频理解和多模态推理研究的发展。

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Conclusion: 通过将半监督3D动作识别建模为MDP问题，并在双曲空间中增强表示学习，该方法能够更智能地选择信息丰富的样本进行标注，提高识别性能。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 放射组学方法在冠状动脉钙化评分中具有优势，无需专家标注即可实现高性能分类。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的实例级组合图像检索数据集i-CIR和无需训练的检索方法BASIC，在多个CIR数据集上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合图像检索(CIR)研究因缺乏高质量训练和评估数据而受限，现有数据集主要关注语义级类别定义而非实例级对象检索。

Method: 提出无需训练的BASIC方法，分别计算查询图像-图像和查询文本-图像的相似度，进行后期融合，并通过简单直观的组件提升各相似度计算。

Result: BASIC在i-CIR数据集上表现优异，同时在现有语义级CIR数据集上也达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: i-CIR数据集填补了实例级CIR评估的空白，BASIC方法展示了无需训练即可实现高性能组合检索的可行性。

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoherentAD方法，通过生成多个候选描述并进行序列级选择，解决自动音频描述生成中的不连贯问题，同时引入StoryRecall指标评估序列质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动音频描述方法通常独立生成每个描述，导致描述序列不连贯、重复，难以帮助视障观众形成连续的画面理解。

Method: CoherentAD方法首先生成每个时间间隔的多个候选描述，然后通过自回归选择机制在整个序列中选择最连贯的描述组合。

Result: 该方法生成的音频描述序列在叙事连贯性方面优于依赖独立生成的先前方法，能够更好地传达真实叙事内容。

Conclusion: 序列级的选择策略能够有效提升音频描述的质量和连贯性，为视障观众提供更好的观影体验。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于UNet架构的肝脏肿瘤分割方法，发现ResNet骨干网络结合CBAM注意力模块的UNet3+模型在多个指标上表现最佳，优于Transformer和Mamba架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多期相增强CT中肝脏结构分割对计算机辅助诊断和治疗规划至关重要，特别是肿瘤检测。研究旨在评估不同骨干网络对肝脏肿瘤分割性能的影响。

Method: 从原始UNet扩展到UNet3+架构，评估了ResNet、Transformer和Mamba三种骨干网络，并引入注意力机制（特别是CBAM模块）来提升分割质量。

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM模块取得了最佳性能：Dice得分0.755、IoU 0.662、HD95距离77.911、准确率0.925、特异性0.926。使用Grad-CAM可视化增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 经典ResNet架构结合现代注意力模块在医学图像分割任务中仍具有高度竞争力，为临床实践中肝脏肿瘤检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

TL;DR: SPADE是一个用于水下基础设施检查的单目深度估计方法，通过结合预训练相对深度估计器和稀疏深度先验，生成密集的度量尺度深度图，在嵌入式硬件上达到15+ FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下基础设施需要频繁检查维护，但当前依赖潜水员或遥控水下航行器存在感知和操作挑战，特别是在复杂结构或浑浊水域中。增强水下航行器的空间感知能力对于降低操控风险和实现更高自主性至关重要。

Method: 提出SPADE稀疏自适应深度估计器：两阶段方法，首先用稀疏深度点缩放相对深度图，然后使用提出的级联卷积-可变形Transformer块细化最终度量预测。

Result: 该方法在精度和泛化能力上优于最先进的基线方法，在嵌入式硬件上高效运行（超过15 FPS），有望支持实际的水下检查和干预任务。

Conclusion: SPADE方法能够有效解决水下环境中的深度估计挑战，为水下基础设施的自主检查提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE

TL;DR: RegionE是一个自适应区域感知生成框架，通过区分图像中的编辑区域和未编辑区域，对未编辑区域使用单步预测，对编辑区域使用局部迭代去噪，显著加速指令式图像编辑任务，在多个先进模型上实现2倍以上的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令式图像编辑模型在处理图像时，对编辑区域和未编辑区域采用统一的生成过程，但这两类区域在生成难度和计算冗余上存在显著差异，导致效率低下。

Method: 1) 自适应区域划分：基于最终估计结果与参考图像的差异划分编辑和未编辑区域；2) 区域感知生成：未编辑区域用单步预测替代多步去噪，编辑区域使用局部迭代去噪和区域指令KV缓存；3) 自适应速度衰减缓存：利用相邻时间步的速度相似性加速局部去噪过程。

Result: 在Step1X-Edit、FLUX.1 Kontext和Qwen-Image-Edit等先进模型上分别实现了2.57、2.41和2.06倍的加速，GPT-4o评估确认语义和感知保真度得到良好保持。

Conclusion: RegionE框架无需额外训练即可显著加速指令式图像编辑任务，通过区域感知的生成策略有效解决了现有模型的计算冗余问题，在保持编辑质量的同时大幅提升效率。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk是一种利用图像空间结构的推测解码方法，能够在不牺牲质量的情况下加速自回归图像生成，实现1.71倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型虽然能产生高保真图像，但推理速度慢。推测解码在文本生成中已证明有效，但在图像生成中应用不足，主要挑战包括更大的采样空间和二维空间结构利用不足。

Method: Hawk方法利用图像的空间结构来指导推测模型进行更准确和高效的预测，通过轻量级草稿模型近似大型自回归模型的输出。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，Hawk实现了1.71倍的速度提升，同时保持了图像保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk成功地将推测解码应用于图像生成，通过利用空间结构解决了采样空间大和局部依赖建模的挑战，为自回归图像生成提供了有效的加速方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated
information about this survey, codes and implementation of the open benchmarks

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

TL;DR: Fortytwo协议利用群体智能和分布式成对排名共识，在AI推理中实现了比多数投票更好的性能，在GPQA Diamond上达到85.90%准确率，比多数投票提升+17.21个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着集中式AI面临计算瓶颈和训练规模收益递减，需要能够水平扩展容量和能力的推理层。

Method: 采用群体推理方法：基于同行排名、声誉加权的异构模型共识，使用成对排名和Bradley-Terry风格聚合模型，结合链上声誉和能力证明机制。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优异，GPQA Diamond准确率85.90%，对抗性提示注入仅退化0.12%，而单体模型基线退化6.20%。

Conclusion: 为去中心化AI系统奠定了基础，通过集体智能实现高质量推理的民主化访问，同时保持可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

Motivation: 现有研究大多局限于抽象框架或线性/随机特征模型，缺乏对CNN架构中弱到强泛化现象的形式化分析。

Method: 使用线性CNN作为弱模型，两层ReLU CNN作为强模型，在包含不同难度标签相关信号和标签无关噪声的结构化数据上，分析梯度下降动态。

Result: 识别了两种机制：数据稀缺机制下泛化通过良性过拟合或有害过拟合发生；数据丰富机制下早期通过标签校正实现泛化，但过度训练会降低性能。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化现象依赖于数据集的信噪比特性，不同机制下泛化方式不同，过度训练可能对性能产生负面影响。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of
model performance beyond averaged scores. Here, we introduce GraphFLA, a Python
framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155
combinatorially complete empirical fitness landscapes, encompassing over 2.2
million sequences across various modalities. All the codes and datasets are

Method: 在ESP32-S3上评估常见低功耗广域网络和针对特定领域数据集训练的压缩CNN模型，使用训练后量化技术压缩模型。

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

Motivation: 揭示现有OOD泛化基准中"准确率在线"现象可能掩盖了重要的失败模式，质疑了实践中伪相关罕见的假设。

Method: 使用基于梯度的OODSelect方法，从异质OOD样本中识别语义一致的子集，分析ID与OOD准确率的关系。

Result: 在广泛使用的分布偏移基准中，OODSelect识别出有时超过标准OOD集一半的子集，其中高ID准确率预测低OOD准确率。

Conclusion: 聚合指标可能掩盖OOD鲁棒性的重要失败模式，需要更细粒度的分析来理解模型在OOD泛化中的真实表现。

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应多任务EEG分类器的卒中快速分诊系统，使用GRU-TCN网络结合深度Q网络实时调整决策阈值，在卒中类型分类上达到98.0%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卒中快速分诊需要准确且可在床边部署的工具，EEG有潜力但未在初次接触中得到充分利用。

Method: 使用32通道EEG信号转换为功率谱密度特征，采用GRU-TCN循环卷积网络预测卒中类型、半球偏侧化和严重程度，并应用深度Q网络实时调整决策阈值。

Result: 基线GRU-TCN在卒中类型分类上达到89.3%准确率，严重程度96.9%，偏侧化96.7%；加入DQN阈值自适应后，卒中类型准确率提升至98.0%。

Conclusion: 自适应阈值调整可将操作点转移到临床偏好的灵敏度-特异性权衡，同时集成的头皮图和频谱可视化支持可解释性。

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

*Biyi Fang,Kripa Rajshekhar,Truong Vo,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了nnLDA，一种神经增强的概率主题模型，通过神经先验机制动态整合辅助信息，在多个基准数据集上优于传统LDA和Dirichlet-Multinomial回归模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型如LDA难以整合元数据、用户属性或文档标签等辅助信息，限制了其表达能力、个性化和可解释性。

Method: nnLDA使用神经先验机制，通过神经网络基于辅助特征生成主题比例的先验分布，捕捉辅助信息与主题分布之间的复杂非线性交互。采用随机变分EM算法联合优化神经和概率组件。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，nnLDA在主题一致性、困惑度和下游分类任务上持续优于LDA和Dirichlet-Multinomial回归。

Conclusion: 结合神经表示学习和概率主题建模在存在辅助信息的情况下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAN-GCN是一种快速准确的冰盖建模模拟器，将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络作为图卷积网络的特征校准器，在保持精度的同时提高了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高冰盖数值模型模拟器的性能，通过改进特征条件化和非线性编码来优化模拟精度和计算效率。

Method: 在GCN前放置KAN作为特征校准器，应用可学习的一维扭曲和线性混合步骤，在不增加消息传递深度的情况下改善特征处理。

Result: 在2-5层架构中，KAN-GCN匹配或超越了纯GCN和MLP-GCN基准的准确性，在较粗网格上提高了推理吞吐量，仅在最细网格上有适度成本增加。

Conclusion: KAN优先设计为大型瞬态场景扫描提供了良好的精度与效率权衡。

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

TL;DR: 提出了WBT-BGRL框架，通过加权三元组损失增强自举学习，用于二分图的归纳链接预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在二分图链接预测中面临负采样效率低、有偏的问题，且在归纳、加权和二分场景下效果未经验证。

Method: 使用双GCN编码器的二分架构，结合加权三元组损失的非对比学习框架。

Result: 在工业和电商数据集上表现优异，特别是预训练时应用加权机制效果显著。

Conclusion: 加权非对比学习对二分图归纳链接预测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is crucial for applications like
recommendation systems and failure detection, yet it is less studied than in
monopartite graphs. Contrastive methods struggle with inefficient and biased
negative sampling, while non-contrastive approaches rely solely on positive
samples. Existing models perform well in transductive settings, but their
effectiveness in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios remains untested.
To address this, we propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph
Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework that enhances bootstrapped
learning with a novel weighting mechanism in the triplet loss. Using a
bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders, WBT-BGRL is evaluated against
adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG). Results on
real-world datasets (Industry and E-commerce) show competitive performance,
especially when weighting is applied during pretraining-highlighting the value
of weighted, non-contrastive learning for inductive link prediction in
bipartite graphs.

*Jiachen Zhao,Yiyou Sun,Weiyan Shi,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs生成的思维链中大部分步骤只是装饰性的，对最终预测没有真正因果影响。通过提出的真实思维评分(TTS)发现平均只有2.3%的推理步骤具有高影响力，并识别出LLMs潜在空间中的真实思维方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前假设思维链忠实反映模型内部思考过程，用于监控不安全意图，但研究发现许多推理步骤实际上对模型预测没有真正贡献。

Method: 提出真实思维评分(TTS)来衡量每个推理步骤对最终预测的因果影响，识别真实思维方向，并通过在潜在空间中沿该方向引导来强制模型执行或忽略特定推理步骤。

Result: 在AIME数据集上，Qwen-2.5模型中平均只有2.3%的推理步骤TTS≥0.7；识别出真实思维方向，通过引导可以改变模型对推理步骤的处理方式；自验证步骤也可能是装饰性的。

Conclusion: LLMs经常口头表达推理步骤而实际上并不在内部执行，这既损害了LLM推理的效率，也削弱了思维链的可信度。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

*Xiutian Zhao,Rochelle Choenni,Rohit Saxena,Ivan Titov*

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型存在文化敏感神经元，这些神经元对特定文化背景的输入表现出选择性敏感，且主要聚集在某些解码器层中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型表现优异，但在处理文化相关输入时仍存在困难，需要理解模型如何处理文化基础信息。

Method: 使用CVQA基准识别文化选择性神经元，通过消融实验验证其重要性，并提出新的基于边际的选择器CAS来识别文化敏感神经元。

Result: 在三个VLMs和25个文化群体上的实验表明，存在特定神经元，其消融会显著影响对应文化问题的性能，而对其他文化影响最小。CAS方法在识别文化敏感神经元方面优于现有的概率和熵基方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态表征的内部组织方式，发现了文化敏感神经元的存在及其在模型中的分布规律。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

Motivation: 现代机器学习在嵌入式等资源受限平台上存在计算需求增长和可靠性不足的问题，贝叶斯神经网络虽然能量化不确定性但计算开销更大。

Method: 采用算法-硬件协同设计：算法层面通过敏感性分析和硬件反馈进行自动层压缩、扩展噪声训练到非平稳条件；硬件层面优化数字加速器并探索模拟硬件；还开发了替代昂贵采样的概率推理方法。

Result: 实现了资源高效且鲁棒的推理，通过Galen系统进行自动压缩，改进了噪声训练的稳健性，开发了高效的近似推理方法，并提出了概率光子计算新范式。

Conclusion: 研究表明效率和可靠性可以通过算法-硬件协同设计共同推进，为下一代可信赖、高能效的机器学习系统奠定基础。

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型的固有低维结构，理解其作为序列概率模型的内在特性。

Method: 通过实证展示语言模型的低秩结构，构建基于模型logits的矩阵并分析其近似秩，然后利用线性组合方法进行生成。

Result: 实证表明多种现代语言模型都表现出低秩结构，可以成功利用不相关提示的线性组合生成目标响应。

Conclusion: 语言模型的低秩结构是一个普遍现象，这种抽象方法能够提供理论预测并与实验结果一致，为理解语言模型的内在结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

Conclusion: 该框架为治疗性抗体发现提供了可扩展的途径，同时直接解决了构象不确定性建模的挑战。

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

TL;DR: LRT-Diffusion是一种风险感知的采样方法，通过将每个去噪步骤视为顺序假设检验，为扩散策略添加了统计风险控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散策略在离线强化学习中缺乏统计意义上的风险概念，通常使用启发式方法进行采样指导。

Method: 使用对数似然比累积，通过逻辑控制器门控条件均值，阈值τ在H0下校准以满足用户指定的Type-I水平α。训练保持标准DDPM结构，推理时添加LRT指导。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务中，LRT-Diffusion在保持期望α的同时，改进了回报与OOD权衡，优于强Q指导基线。

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion是一种即插即用的推理时方法，为离线RL的扩散策略添加了原则性、校准的风险控制。

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

Conclusion: 研究表明开发可访问的实时监测工具的潜力，能够预测癫痫发作，实现从被动管理到主动预防的转变，帮助患者采取预防措施降低风险。

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

TL;DR: SPIRE是一种深度多编码器自编码器，能够将多区域神经记录分解为共享和私有潜在子空间，通过新颖的对齐和解缠损失来分离网络级动态与区域特定活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多区域神经数据建模中，分离共享网络级动态与区域特定活动是一个核心挑战。

Method: 引入SPIRE（共享-私有区域间编码器），使用深度多编码器自编码器架构，配备新颖的对齐和解缠损失函数，仅基于基线数据进行训练。

Result: 在具有真实潜在变量的合成基准测试中，SPIRE在非线性扭曲和时间错位下优于经典概率模型。应用于颅内深部脑刺激记录时，SPIRE显示共享潜在变量可靠地编码了刺激特定特征，这些特征在不同部位和频率间具有泛化性。

Conclusion: SPIRE为分析刺激下多区域神经动态提供了一个实用、可复现的工具。

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了基于放射组学的机器学习模型在MRI序列分布偏移下的鲁棒性，发现使用协议不变特征训练的模型在分布偏移下能保持F1分数>0.85，而使用所有特征的模型性能下降40%。数据集增强显著改善了不确定性估计质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于放射组学的机器学习模型在临床决策支持中具有潜力，但容易受到成像协议、定位和分割变化引起的分布偏移影响，需要系统评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 使用16个水果的体模，评估了五种MRI序列的协议变化、分割变化和观察者间变异性。训练XGBoost分类器，比较协议不变特征与序列特定特征在域内和域外条件下的性能。

Result: 使用协议不变特征训练的模型在分布偏移下F1分数>0.85，而使用所有特征的模型性能下降40%。数据集增强使预期校准误差降低35%，温度缩放校准效果有限。

Conclusion: 协议感知的特征选择和受控体模研究能有效预测模型在分布偏移下的行为，为开发对现实世界协议变化具有鲁棒性的放射组学模型提供了框架。

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化算法如SGD和Adam在处理学习效率波动、复杂模型需求和非凸优化问题时存在明显不足，特别是在处理复杂数据结构和模型时面临学习率选择困难、局部最优规避和高维空间导航等挑战。

Method: 基于传统方法，引入依赖历史数据的动态引导机制，动态更新动量和学习率，使优化器能灵活调整对历史信息的依赖，适应不同训练场景。

Result: 经过大量实验验证，DWMGrad在多种场景下能够实现更快的收敛速度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: DWMGrad算法通过动态调整机制，显著提升了优化器对变化环境和任务复杂度的适应能力，在收敛速度和精度方面都优于传统方法。

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Result: 观察到黑盒函数可以提升模型性能，且无需对黑盒函数本身进行大量优化。

Conclusion: 利用固定的不可训练模块扩展模型容量具有潜力，为结合模拟和数字设备作为网络扩展机制提供了路径。

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible
computational graphs. BOND demonstrates improved accuracy and scalability from
existing perturbative methods, enabling new explorations of trainable
architectures that integrate black-box functions. We observe that these
black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the
architecture or properties of the black-box function itself. Our findings
highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand
model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices
as a mechanism for scaling networks.

TL;DR: PESO是一种用于推荐系统中LoRA持续学习的新方法，通过近端正则化在适应新数据和保留有用知识之间实现灵活平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的持续学习方法主要关注保留先前任务的性能，但忽略了推荐系统的特殊性：目标不是预测过去偏好，过时的偏好甚至会在用户兴趣变化时损害性能。

Method: 提出PESO方法，引入近端正则化器，将当前适配器锚定到其最近的冻结状态，使模型能够灵活平衡适应性和保留性，更好地捕捉最近用户行为。

Result: 理论上证明该近端设计在LoRA子空间中提供数据感知、方向性指导；实证上PESO始终优于现有的基于LoRA的持续学习方法。

Conclusion: PESO通过近端正则化有效解决了推荐系统中持续学习的独特挑战，在适应性和保留性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

TL;DR: FairMIB是一个多视图信息瓶颈框架，通过分解图的特征、结构和扩散视图来缓解GNN中的复杂性偏见，使用对比学习和条件信息瓶颈来平衡任务效用和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在处理关系数据时可能放大训练数据偏见，传播歧视性属性和结构不平衡，导致不公平结果。现有公平方法通常将偏见视为单一来源，忽略了属性和结构的不同影响。

Method: 提出FairMIB框架：1）将图分解为特征、结构和扩散视图；2）使用对比学习最大化跨视图互信息；3）集成多视角条件信息瓶颈目标；4）在扩散视图中引入逆概率加权邻接校正。

Result: 在五个真实世界基准数据集上的实验表明，FairMIB在效用和公平性指标上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FairMIB通过多视图分解和对比学习有效缓解了GNN中的偏见传播问题，在保持任务效用的同时显著提高了公平性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

Conclusion: 分布偏移不总是有害的，在某些情况下可以带来性能提升，这一分析也适用于具有不同组件"技能"分布的组合设置。

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

Conclusion: 神经微分流形代表了向几何结构化、可解释和高效深度学习系统的根本性转变，尽管仍存在显著的计算挑战。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

Conclusion: δ-度量可以用于所提出的聚类模型对抗学习双层模型，为对抗攻击效果提供了有效的衡量方法。

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

Result: 成功学习到波传播的高效低维表示，发现分解后的每个模式对应可解释的物理特征，并且LRNR架构支持通过压缩方案实现高效推理。

Conclusion: LRNR方法能够直接从数据中学习双曲波传播的物理特征分解，提供可解释的表示，并且在性能要求高的场景下具有部署潜力。

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

Motivation: 现实世界数据集通常同时具有序列性和关系性，但现有方法往往忽略其中一个模态。作者认为序列和图不是分离的问题，而是同一数据集的互补方面，应该联合学习。

Method: 提出BRIDGE架构，将序列编码器与GNN在单一目标下耦合，允许梯度在两者间流动。添加TOKENXATTN层实现邻居序列间token级的细粒度消息传递。

Conclusion: 序列和图应该联合建模，BRIDGE通过端到端耦合序列编码器和GNN，并引入token级交叉注意力，有效提升了多模态数据的建模性能。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架，将数据增强与因果推断相结合，论证了DA不仅可用于i.i.d.设置下的正则化，还能通过干预治疗生成机制来改善因果效应估计，特别是在存在未观测混杂因素时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强主要用于i.i.d.设置的正则化，但IVs在实际应用中往往不易获得。本文旨在探索DA在超越i.i.d.设置、改善跨干预泛化方面的潜力，特别是当结果生成机制对DA选择不变时，DA可被视为对治疗生成机制的干预。

Method: 通过适当正则化基于IV的估计器，引入IV-like回归概念来缓解混杂偏倚；将参数化DA建模为IVL回归问题，并通过组合使用模拟最坏情况下的DA应用。

Result: 理论分析和模拟实验表明，该方法在因果估计和泛化任务上优于简单DA，在线性示例的有限样本情况下得到验证，并通过真实数据实验支持了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 数据增强可以超越传统的正则化作用，在因果推断框架下作为干预工具，有效改善存在未观测混杂时的因果效应估计和跨干预泛化性能。

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在认证鲁棒性中，较小的Lipschitz常数意味着模型对其预测具有更强的对抗样本鲁棒性。然而，现有的过近似方法存在显著的近似误差，阻碍了获得紧的局部Lipschitz常数。

Method: 提出Lipschitz感知的线性嫁接方法，将线性函数嫁接到非线性激活函数中，消除主导的近似误差源，从而获得更紧的局部Lipschitz常数。

Result: 实验表明，将线性性嫁接到有影响力的激活函数中可以收紧l∞局部Lipschitz常数，并增强认证鲁棒性，即使没有进行认证训练。

Conclusion: 线性嫁接通过消除近似误差来改善认证鲁棒性，特别是在非线性激活函数中嫁接线性性可以显著收紧局部Lipschitz常数。

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于深度时间序列预测的选择性学习策略，通过双掩码机制筛选可泛化的时间步，避免对不确定和异常时间步的过度拟合。

Motivation: 深度模型在时间序列预测中容易因噪声和异常而过度拟合，传统方法对所有时间步进行统一优化导致模型学习不确定和异常时间步。

Method: 引入选择性学习策略，使用双掩码机制：不确定性掩码利用残差熵筛选不确定时间步，异常掩码使用残差下界估计排除异常时间步。

Conclusion: 选择性学习策略能有效缓解深度时间序列预测中的过拟合问题，提高模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

Result: 在8个公共数据集上的广泛实验显示，在不同类别先验和类别数量的情况下，相比强基线方法在准确性和稳定性方面都取得了持续提升。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应损失加权方法在多类正例-未标注学习场景中实现了无偏风险估计，并在多个数据集上表现出优越的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BSFA是一种新颖的即插即用框架，通过在不同特征子空间上差异化缩放更新分量来加速深度学习训练，在LLaMA预训练中实现约2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习优化中存在基本二分法：沿损失Hessian顶部特征方向的参数更新虽然幅度大，但对损失减少贡献小；而正交分量的更新幅度小但驱动大部分学习进展。

Method: 提出BSFA框架，通过PCA对历史更新进行高效子空间估计，采用逐块策略在参数块基础上应用估计，差异化缩放不同子空间的更新分量。

Result: 在各种任务中展示加速效果，特别是在WikiText-103上预训练LLaMA-72M和在OpenWebText上预训练LLaMA-134M时，相比标准AdamW实现约2倍加速。

Conclusion: BSFA通过高效子空间估计和块级策略，为当代大模型提供了实用且可扩展的加速方案，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov
chain. We present two techniques to improve sampling. First, we give an
efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归一化方法如BatchNorm、LayerNorm和RMSNorm都是方差中心化的，虽然能稳定训练但无法控制表示如何捕捉任务相关信息。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理，引入有界压缩操作，鼓励嵌入在保留预测信息的同时抑制冗余变异性。

Conclusion: IBNorm在理论和实证上都优于传统方差中心化归一化方法，能产生更具信息量的表示同时保持标准归一化的稳定性和兼容性。

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code
will be released publicly.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

Result: 算法在合成MDP和标准RL环境中进行了实验验证，证明能有效平衡期望回报和目标状态访问的分散性。

Conclusion: 该算法成功解决了在最大化期望回报的同时实现目标状态均匀访问的问题，提供了性能保证和收敛性分析。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order

showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we

of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

Conclusion: 损失函数的凸性转换现象是普遍存在的，基于此设计的混合优化算法能有效结合非凸和凸优化方法的优势。

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

*Julien Martinelli*

TL;DR: 提出生物学信息机器学习(BIML)，作为物理信息机器学习(PIML)的扩展，专门针对生物学建模的独特挑战进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息机器学习在物理领域成功应用，但生物学建模面临多方面的挑战：先验知识不确定、数据异质嘈杂、部分可观测性、复杂高维网络等，需要专门的方法论。

Method: 提出BIML框架，基于四个基础支柱：不确定性量化、情境化、约束潜结构推断和可扩展性，利用基础模型和大型语言模型作为关键赋能工具。

Result: BIML能够保留PIML的结构化基础，同时适应生物学的实际需求，在较软的概率形式先验知识下运行。

Conclusion: BIML为生物学建模提供了有前景的方向，需要构建相应的生态系统，将PIML启发的创新引向具有高科学和社会相关性的挑战。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

Motivation: 机器学习中许多问题关注有限维空间之间的映射学习，但科学应用需要逼近函数空间之间的映射（算子）。本文旨在为学习算子集合提供理论和实证基础。

Method: 提出了两种新架构MNO和MONet，建立了在连续、可积或Lipschitz算子三种设置下的通用逼近结果，并推导了网络规模与逼近精度之间的显式缩放规律。对于单算子学习，开发了平衡子网络架构复杂度的框架。

Conclusion: 这项工作为跨多个算子的可扩展神经算子学习建立了统一的理论和实践基础。

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

Motivation: 解决昂贵、无导数黑盒函数的全局优化问题需要极高的样本效率。传统贝叶斯优化方法虽然有效但需要针对每个应用领域进行精细的参数调优，而现有大语言模型在连续黑盒优化任务上能力有限。

Method: 通过在大规模合成数据集上微调大语言模型，这些数据集来自多样化的贝叶斯优化参数化配置，利用LLM的预训练能力实现跨优化任务的泛化。

Conclusion: GPTOpt为无需参数调优的全局优化提供了一个灵活框架，证明了LLM在连续黑盒优化任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

Motivation: 现有多类校准评估方法要么关注预测的特定方面（如top-class置信度、class-wise校准），要么使用计算复杂的变分公式，需要可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 提出效用校准框架，通过定义特定效用函数来测量校准误差，该函数封装了与最终用户目标或决策标准相关的信息。

Conclusion: 效用校准提供了一种通用且可扩展的方法来评估多类校准，能够适应不同的用户需求和决策场景。

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出梯度权重对齐（GWA）作为深度学习中的鲁棒验证指标，通过量化每个样本梯度与模型权重之间的一致性来跟踪泛化性能，无需验证集即可实现早期停止、模型比较和识别有影响力的训练样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度学习监督分类中，需要鲁棒的验证指标来检测过拟合、监控训练动态，并直接基于训练数据评估模型性能，避免依赖验证集。

Method: 引入梯度权重对齐（GWA）方法，计算每个样本梯度与模型权重之间的一致性程度，有效学习对应一致的对齐，而错位则表明泛化性能下降。

Result: 实验表明GWA能准确预测最优早期停止点，支持基于原则的模型比较，识别有影响力的训练样本，提供直接从训练数据进行的模型分析方法。

Conclusion: GWA提供了一种无需验证集的模型分析框架，能够有效监控训练动态、评估泛化性能，并识别训练数据中的关键样本。

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

Conclusion: 原型基础化是一种有效且标注高效的策略，为安全可靠的神经符号学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

Abstract: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in
efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing
synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper
presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The
model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully
parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for
windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal
state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse
generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes,
and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the
Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance,
outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast
majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than
existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.
We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code,
providing a reproducible foundation for future research.

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, with a significant
impact on individual well-being and organizational performance. This study
proposes a machine learning approach to predict burnout risk using the
HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset. Three supervised algorithms
were evaluated: nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and support vector

cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力机制的图结构学习方法理论保证仅限于树状图，无法处理更一般的DAG结构，特别是当节点有多个父节点时，难以设计训练目标让不同注意力头分别学习不同的父子依赖关系。

Method: 引入基于f-散度的核引导互信息(KG-MI)度量，结合多头注意力框架，每个头关联不同的边际转移核来建模多样化的父子依赖关系。

Result: 理论证明：对于K-父节点DAG生成的序列，通过梯度上升训练单层多头transformer能在多项式时间内收敛到全局最优；当f-散度特化为KL散度时，学习到的注意力分数能准确反映真实邻接矩阵，从而可证明地恢复底层图结构。

Conclusion: 提出的KG-MI方法为多头注意力机制学习一般DAG结构提供了理论保证，实验验证了理论发现，解决了现有方法在处理多父节点图结构时的局限性。

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

Conclusion: 这是第一个基于量子操作并在广泛序列学习任务中达到与强经典基线竞争性能的模型，展示了量子循环神经网络在序列学习中的潜力。

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting

Motivation: 经典PAC-Bayes框架只能提供随机采样假设的期望风险保证，需要随机预测，无法在需要部署单个确定性假设的实际场景中使用。

Method: 提出了一个统一框架，包括一般oracle界、数值界和多数投票特化，用于从随机PAC-Bayesian保证中提取单个确定性假设的保证。

Result: 经验表明，该方法在确定性分类器的泛化界方面始终优于流行基线（最高可达2倍）。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将随机PAC-Bayesian保证转化为单个确定性假设的保证，解决了实际部署中的限制问题。

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in

real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

### [139] [Generalized Sobolev IPM for Graph-Based Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25591)
*Tam Le,Truyen Nguyen,Hideitsu Hino,Kenji Fukumizu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Orlicz几何结构的广义Sobolev IPM（GSI），通过Musielak正则化将复杂计算简化为单变量优化问题，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sobolev IPM方法受限于L^p几何结构，无法融入其他结构先验。为了突破这一限制，需要构建更灵活的几何结构框架。

Method: 通过Orlicz几何结构推广Sobolev IPM，建立Orlicz-Sobolev范数与Musielak范数的理论联系，并利用图结构将GSI-M简化为单变量优化问题。

Result: GSI-M在计算上比流行的OW快几个数量级，在文档分类和拓扑数据分析任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的GSI-M框架不仅包含经典Sobolev IPM作为特例，还能适应多样化的几何先验，同时实现了显著的计算效率提升。

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

*Arani Roy,Marco P. Apolinario,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SVD分解的结构化局部学习框架，在低秩流形上训练深度神经网络，减少可训练参数数量，同时保持与反向传播相当的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决反向传播全局误差传播和全参数化带来的内存计算开销问题，以及直接反馈对齐方法在深层架构中可扩展性差的问题。

Method: 在SVD分解的权重矩阵低秩流形上训练，对SVD分量应用包含交叉熵、子空间对齐和正交正则化的复合损失函数，构建与SVD结构匹配的反馈矩阵。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上达到与反向传播相当的准确率，同时减少了可训练参数数量。

Conclusion: 低秩流形上的局部学习是替代全秩梯度训练的原则性和可扩展方案。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 提出基于核评分规则的不确定性度量框架，统一了多种已知度量方法，为回归任务中的不确定性量化提供原则性设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回归任务（特别是在安全关键领域）需要恰当的不确定性量化，但现有文献主要关注分类问题。

Method: 基于适当评分规则（特别是核评分）构建总不确定性、偶然不确定性和认知不确定性的度量家族，通过核选择控制度量行为特性。

Result: 实验证明这些度量在下游任务中有效，揭示了不同实现之间的权衡（如鲁棒性和分布外检测性能）。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了多种不确定性度量方法，提供了基于核评分规则的任务特定度量设计原则，在回归任务的不确定性量化方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了FP和INT量化格式在不同粒度下的性能，发现FP在粗粒度量化中表现优异，但在细粒度（块级）8位量化中MXINT8在算法精度和硬件效率上都优于FP格式。对于4位格式，FP通常有精度优势，但通过异常值缓解技术NVINT4可以超越NVFP4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI硬件越来越倾向于使用低精度FP格式来处理LLM中的激活异常值，但缺乏FP和INT量化在不同粒度下的统一比较，导致算法和硬件协同设计缺乏明确指导。

Method: 系统研究FP和INT格式之间的权衡，包括不同粒度（粗粒度和细粒度）和位宽（8位和4位）的比较，引入对称裁剪方法解决细粒度低比特INT训练中的梯度偏差问题。

Result: 发现性能关键交叉点：FP在粗粒度量化中表现优异，但在细粒度8位量化中MXINT8在精度和硬件效率上都优于FP；对于4位格式，FP通常有精度优势，但通过Hadamard旋转等异常值缓解技术，NVINT4可以超越NVFP4。

Conclusion: 挑战当前硬件发展趋势，证明一刀切的FP方法不是最优选择，主张细粒度INT格式（特别是MXINT8）为未来AI加速器提供了更好的精度、功耗和效率平衡。

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

Motivation: 改进WGAN框架的训练稳定性，探索BOLT原则在GAN训练中的广泛应用潜力。

Method: 在WGAN框架中引入BOLT思想，使用Lipschitz连续判别器，隐式最小化不同于Earth Mover距离的度量距离。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CelebA-64、LSUN Bedroom-64和LSUN Church-64四个基准测试中，BOLT-GAN始终优于WGAN，FID降低了10-60%。

Conclusion: BOLT是增强GAN训练的一个广泛适用原则，BOLT-GAN在保持简单性的同时显著提升了生成性能。

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

Motivation: 研究VLA模型在动作微调过程中，预训练的视觉语言模型的表征和知识能在多大程度上被保留，因为不清楚动作微调是否会导致原有视觉语言能力的退化。

Method: 通过探测VLA模型的隐藏表征和分析注意力图来表征和测量退化效应；设计对比任务和方法来隔离动作微调引起的视觉语言能力变化；评估多种视觉表征对齐策略，并提出简单有效的对齐方法。

Result: 发现简单的动作微调会导致视觉表征退化；提出的对齐方法能够有效缓解退化并提高在分布外场景的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 阐明了动作微调与视觉语言表征退化之间的权衡关系，并提出了恢复继承的视觉语言能力的实用方法。

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中图结构数据的互联子图场景问题，现有方法存在隐私风险或计算复杂度高的局限性。

Method: 使用拉普拉斯平滑在谱域中捕获全局结构信息，避免交换敏感节点嵌入，提供形式化隐私分析。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，FedLap相比现有技术实现了竞争性或更优的效用。

Conclusion: FedLap是首个具有强隐私保证的子图联邦学习方案，在保持隐私的同时实现了良好的性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文建立了对称矩阵谱范数扰动的新界限，改进了经典的Eckart-Young-Mirsky定理，并应用于差分隐私PCA，解决了文献中的开放问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中需要理解噪声或测量误差如何影响低秩近似，特别是在谱范数下。差分隐私低秩近似中，需要在保护隐私的同时保持数据的top-p结构。现有工作主要分析Frobenius范数误差，但该度量可能高估或低估真实的子空间失真。

Method: 使用复分析中的新颖轮廓自举方法，并将其扩展到包括多项式和矩阵指数在内的广泛谱函数类。在温和的特征值间隙和范数条件下，建立对称矩阵的高概率谱范数扰动界限。

Result: 新界限对‖(A+E)_p - A_p‖提供了锐利估计，改进因子可达√n。经验结果证实该界限在不同扰动机制下紧密跟踪实际谱误差。

Conclusion: 本文的谱范数扰动界限改进了经典结果，并为差分隐私PCA提供了改进的效用保证，解决了文献中的开放问题。

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在计算流体动力学中已有应用，但在结构问题特别是动态案例中研究较少，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 采用编码-处理-解码的GNN范式，具有三个关键特征：节点固定局部坐标系、符号感知回归损失和波长感知连接半径。

Result: 在50kHz汉宁调制脉冲激励的梁案例中，GNSS准确再现了数百个时间步的物理过程，并能泛化到未见过的加载条件。

Conclusion: 具有物理一致性更新规则的局部保持GNN是动态、波主导结构模拟的竞争性替代方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

Motivation: 传统RNN在处理长序列时会丢失局部细节，现有方法如SpikGRU无法捕捉事件驱动的时空数据中的细粒度局部依赖关系。

Method: 开发了CS-GRU细胞，利用卷积操作保持局部结构和依赖关系，同时整合脉冲神经元的时间精度和GRU的高效门控机制。

Result: 在时序数据集（NTIDIGITS、SHD）和时空基准测试（MNIST、DVSGesture、CIFAR10DVS）上表现优异，平均比最先进的GRU变体高出4.35%，在MNIST上达到99.31%准确率，比SpikGRU效率高69%。

Conclusion: CS-GRU是一个多功能架构，在时序和时空数据处理方面都表现出色，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了PDE约束问题的计算效率和预测可靠性，为IBVP求解提供了更优方案。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

Abstract: With the recent growth of Deep Learning for AI, there is a need for tools to
meet the demand of data flowing into those models. In some cases, source data
may exist in multiple formats, and therefore the source data must be
investigated and properly engineered for a Machine Learning model or graph
database. Overhead and lack of scalability with existing workflows limit
integration within a larger processing pipeline such as Apache Airflow, driving
the need for a robust, extensible, and lightweight tool to preprocess arbitrary
datasets that scales with data type and size. To address this, we present
Machine Learning Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis, MLPrE, in which
SparkDataFrames were utilized to hold data during processing and ensure
scalability. A generalizable JSON input file format was utilized to describe
stepwise changes to that DataFrame. Stages were implemented for input and
output, filtering, basic statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data
analysis. A total of 69 stages were implemented into MLPrE, of which we
highlight and demonstrate key stages using six diverse datasets. We further
highlight MLPrE's ability to independently process multiple fields in flat
files and recombine them, otherwise requiring an additional pipeline, using a
UniProt glossary term dataset. Building on this advantage, we demonstrated the
clustering stage with available wine quality data. Lastly, we demonstrate the
preparation of data for a graph database in the final stages of MLPrE using
phosphosite kinase data. Overall, our MLPrE tool offers a generalizable and
scalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis, filling a critical
need for such a tool given the ever expanding use of machine learning. This
tool serves to accelerate and simplify early stage development in larger
workflows.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了传统多实例学习在医学影像中的局限性，指出其忽略了实例间的上下文关系，并通过合成分类任务验证了现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多实例学习方法在处理医学影像时将实例独立处理，忽略了相邻切片或图像块之间的上下文关系，这在真实应用中可能影响分类准确性。

Method: 设计了一个合成分类任务，其中考虑相邻实例特征对准确预测至关重要，并将现有多实例学习方法与最优贝叶斯估计器进行比较。

Result: 实证研究表明，即使是较新的相关多实例学习方法，在从头开始训练数万个实例时，仍然难以达到最优的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 多实例学习方法需要更好地整合实例间的上下文关系，当前方法在处理相邻实例特征方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

TL;DR: 提出神经随机流(NSFs)及其潜在变体，通过条件归一化流直接学习SDE转移规律，实现任意时间点的一步采样，相比传统数值方法获得高达两个数量级的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机微分方程(SDE)建模方法需要昂贵的数值求解器在任意时间点之间采样，计算成本高。

Method: 使用具有架构约束的条件归一化流直接学习SDE转移规律，保留随机流的性质，实现一步采样。

Result: 在合成SDE模拟和真实世界跟踪、视频数据上，NSFs在保持与数值方法相当的分布准确性的同时，大幅减少了任意时间点采样的计算量。

Conclusion: NSFs为SDE建模提供了一种高效替代方案，在保持准确性的同时显著加速采样过程。

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理树结构的新调度算法Re-Schedule，通过r-score衡量查询学习难度，从简单到复杂构建课程，在数学推理基准上显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR数据调度方法依赖路径指标，忽略了查询的推理树结构，需要更强大的调度基础。

Method: 引入推理分数(r-score)衡量查询学习难度，基于此提出Re-Schedule调度算法，构建从结构简单到复杂的课程。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准上的实验显示，Re-Schedule显著提升平均准确率，最高增益达3.2%。

Conclusion: 推理树的结构理解为RLVR数据调度提供了更强大和原则性的基础。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

TL;DR: 研究循环结构因果模型中的反事实推理，关注移位-尺度干预下的因果推断


<details>

Motivation: 传统反事实推理框架假设无环结构因果模型，但现实系统（如生物系统）常包含反馈循环或循环依赖，违反无环性假设

Method: 在循环结构因果模型中研究反事实推理，特别关注移位-尺度干预（软性、策略式变化，重新缩放和/或移动变量机制）

Result: 论文探讨了在循环系统中进行反事实推理的方法论

Conclusion: 循环结构因果模型中的反事实推理对于理解现实世界系统的因果机制具有重要意义

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

TL;DR: ProFees是一个基于LLM的框架，用于自动化医疗评估与管理编码，在真实数据集上比商业系统准确率提高36%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化E/M编码可以减轻医生文档负担，提高计费效率，最终改善患者护理质量。

Method: 使用基于大语言模型的框架ProFees来处理现实世界中的复杂编码挑战。

Result: 在专家策划的真实数据集上，ProFees比商业CPT E/M编码系统准确率提高36%以上，比最强单提示基线提高近5%。

Conclusion: ProFees框架有效解决了现实世界E/M编码的复杂性，显著提高了编码准确性。

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

TL;DR: ASTP方法通过显式状态跟踪提示，解决LLM在游戏交易系统中无法遵循流程规则的问题，实现99%状态合规性和99.3%计算精度，同时大幅提升响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在动态游戏交互中具有灵活性，但无法遵循规则化交易系统的关键流程（浏览-报价-审核-确认），这会损害玩家信任。

Method: 提出自回归状态跟踪提示（ASTP），通过策略性编排的提示强制LLM显式跟踪和报告状态标签，并结合状态特定的占位符后处理方法确保交易完整性。

Result: 在300个交易对话评估中，状态合规性>99%，计算精度99.3%。小模型（Gemini-2.5-Flash）使用ASTP后性能可匹敌大模型（Gemini-2.5-Pro），响应时间从21.2秒降至2.4秒。

Conclusion: ASTP为商业游戏提供了同时满足实时性要求和资源约束的实用基础，平衡了LLM的创造灵活性与程序化交易需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的后训练奖励方案通常是结果导向的，缺乏对推理过程的关注，限制了大型推理模型的多步推理能力发展。

Method: 使用过程挖掘技术计算一致性奖励，衡量策略模型的推理过程与预训练教师模型的匹配程度，在群组相对策略优化中结合答案/格式奖励和推理过程信号。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实证结果表明，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的GRPO后训练方法。

Conclusion: 利用过程挖掘进行推理感知的GRPO能有效增强策略模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1是一个基于多阶段课程强化学习的LLM，通过结果监督训练，在知识库问答任务中实现自主推理，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBQA方法通常通过过程监督微调LLMs，但这种方法对探索的激励不足，无法有效增强代理推理能力。

Method: 采用多阶段课程强化学习，首先在高质量轨迹上微调LLM建立基础能力，然后通过从易到难的奖励调度应用课程RL来缓解结果监督的奖励稀疏问题。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上持续优于现有方法，在GrailQA的零样本子集上相对提升达11.1%，仅使用十二分之一的训练数据。

Conclusion: 基于结果监督训练的KnowCoder-A1展现出强大的推理能力，证明了多阶段课程RL在增强LLMs代理推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法通常作为静态层应用于输入或输出，仅提供二元分类（安全或不安全），缺乏上下文感知和可解释性。

Method: 引入动态协作代理框架，包括Shield、Responder、Evaluator和Reflector四个代理，实现上下文感知和可解释的审核。

Result: 在5个数据集和4个大型视觉语言模型上的实验表明，攻击成功率降低7-19%，拒绝率提高4-20%，保持稳定的不遵循率。

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation通过利用代理架构的灵活性和推理能力，提供了模块化、可扩展和细粒度的安全执行，展示了代理系统作为自动化安全治理基础的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Conclusion: EneAD框架在能耗和驾驶性能方面均表现出优越性，为自动驾驶系统的能效优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

Method: 提出RAVR（Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning）框架，使用答案条件推理作为仅问题推理的变分代理，通过答案引导生成更优的推理路径。

Result: 在通用和数学领域的实验中，RAVR相比强基线方法都取得了持续改进。分析发现RAVR减少了犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了问题特定的推理策略。

Conclusion: 答案条件推理能够显著提高采样推理路径的期望效用，将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题，为LLM的推理能力优化提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

Method: 训练代理基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，自主确定哪些工具可以并行执行，哪些必须遵循顺序依赖。采用两阶段训练策略：在构建的图规划数据集上进行监督微调，然后在策略性采样的查询上使用基于正确性的奖励函数进行强化学习。

Result: 在MHQA数据集上的实验结果表明，GAP显著优于传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务上，同时通过智能并行化实现了工具调用效率的显著提升。

Conclusion: GAP框架通过依赖感知的编排机制，在保持任务准确性的同时大幅提升了执行效率，为复杂任务解决提供了更高效的代理规划方法。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

### [167] [Grouping Nodes With Known Value Differences: A Lossless UCT-based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25388)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了KVDA-UCT算法，通过已知价值差异抽象框架改进MCTS的样本效率，相比现有OGA-UCT方法能检测到更多抽象状态，在多种确定性环境中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OGA-UCT算法要求抽象的状态-动作对具有相同的即时奖励，这一刚性条件限制了可找到的抽象数量，从而影响了MCTS的样本效率。

Method: 提出KVDA框架，不再要求状态-动作对价值相同，而是允许价值不同的状态-动作对进行抽象，只要它们的价值差异可以被推断。基于此框架开发了KVDA-UCT算法。

Result: KVDA-UCT比OGA-UCT检测到显著更多的抽象状态，没有引入额外参数，在多种确定性环境和参数设置下表现优于OGA-UCT。

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过允许价值差异可推断的状态抽象，有效提高了MCTS的样本效率，KVDA-UCT算法在确定性环境中具有更好的性能。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个双范式框架，将智能体AI系统分为符号/经典范式和神经/生成范式，并通过系统文献综述分析了两种范式在理论基础、领域应用和伦理治理方面的差异与互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前对智能体AI理解的碎片化问题，避免概念回溯的混淆，为这一快速发展的领域提供清晰的理论框架和分析工具。

Method: 采用PRISMA系统综述方法，分析了2018-2025年间的90项研究，从三个维度（理论基础与架构原则、领域特定实现、伦理治理挑战）进行结构化分析。

Result: 发现范式选择具有战略性：符号系统主导安全关键领域（如医疗），神经系统在适应性强的数据丰富环境中占优（如金融）；识别出符号系统治理模型不足和神经符号混合架构需求等关键研究空白。

Conclusion: 智能体AI的未来不在于单一范式的统治，而在于两种范式的有意整合，以创建既具适应性又可靠的新型智能系统。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

*Willem Fourie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新视角：将AI系统的工具性目标视为需要接受和管理的特征，而非需要限制的故障，并建议通过理解和管理这些目标来实现与人类目标的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI对齐理论将工具性目标视为风险来源，试图限制其症状，但本文认为这种观点可能不够有效，需要重新思考如何对待这些目标。

Method: 借鉴亚里士多德的本体论及其现代解释，构建了一个具体、目标导向实体的本体论框架，将先进AI系统视为其形式和物质构成会产生与设计者意图不同效果的产物。

Result: 论证了AI系统的工具性倾向是其构成的内在结果，而非偶然故障，因此应该被视为需要管理的特征。

Conclusion: AI对齐工作应更侧重于理解和引导工具性目标，而非试图消除它们，从而更好地实现与人类目标的对齐。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态执行反馈，限制了实时错误纠正能力。整合多轮工具调用和动态反馈可以显著提升适应性和鲁棒性

Method: 提出执行感知的多轮推理范式，在每个推理步骤无缝集成数据库执行反馈；扩展GRPO算法适应复杂多轮交互场景，添加轨迹过滤机制并移除KL损失约束

Result: 在BIRD Dev上达到64.4%准确率，在SPIDER Dev上达到84.6%执行准确率，显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL框架通过动态反馈和多轮推理有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，证明了执行感知推理的价值

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在归纳逻辑编程中，各种规则生成方法（如谓词发明）会产生包含未命名谓词的规则，这降低了逻辑理论的可读性、可解释性和可重用性。

Method: 利用大型语言模型处理自然语言和代码的能力，为未命名谓词提供语义上有意义的命名建议。

Result: 在手工制作的逻辑规则上评估表明，大型语言模型在这项任务上具有潜力。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够为逻辑规则中的未命名谓词生成有意义的名称，有助于提高逻辑理论的质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了模型在可验证和不可验证领域的推理能力，实现了推理能力在不同领域间的迁移。

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE通过生成关键状态和动态一致的转换，成功解决了被动探索的局限性，为强化学习探索提供了有效的新方法。

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Conclusion: CAIR是首个能够评估多智能体系统中智能体影响力的方法，为理解和优化AAW系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理长而复杂的多页文档时表现不佳，通常依赖固定的推理模板或刚性流程，限制了模型的效率和泛化能力。

Method: 提出ALDEN框架，包含fetch动作直接访问页面，基于规则的跨层级奖励机制进行密集过程监督，以及视觉语义锚定机制通过双路径KL散度约束稳定训练过程。

Result: 在三个开源数据集构建的语料库上训练后，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读向能够自主导航和推理长视觉丰富文档的智能代理的转变，为更准确和高效的长文档理解提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated

information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate

Method: 引入BambooKG知识图谱，在非三元组边上使用基于频率的权重来反映链接强度，借鉴赫布原理。

Result: 减少了信息损失，在单跳和多跳推理任务上性能提升，优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: BambooKG通过频率加权的非三元组边有效改善了知识图谱的信息保留能力，提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

TL;DR: TheraMind是一个用于纵向心理咨询的战略性自适应代理，采用双循环架构来解决现有方法在情感理解、适应性策略和多会话治疗方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的心理咨询大语言模型缺乏情感理解、适应性策略和跨会话治疗方法的运用，与真实临床实践存在差距。

Method: 提出双循环架构：会话内循环用于战术对话管理，感知患者情绪状态并动态选择响应策略；跨会话循环用于战略性治疗规划，评估治疗效果并调整后续方法。

Result: 在高保真模拟环境中的广泛评估显示，TheraMind在多会话指标（如连贯性、灵活性和治疗协调性）上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 双循环设计在模拟战略性、自适应和纵向治疗行为方面有效，验证了该架构在心理咨询中的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏置估计器在WoS型蒙特卡洛求解器中虽然提高了样本重用率，但在格林函数近似时引入了相关性伪影和偏差。

Method: 使用局部相似性过滤和原则性加权策略，选择性地结合邻近评估点的样本，抑制不可靠估计器。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平衡偏差和方差，自然地扩展到梯度场估计和混合边界问题。

Abstract: Stochastic PDE solvers have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
discretization-based methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs),
especially in geometry processing and graphics. While off-centered estimators
enhance sample reuse in WoS-type Monte Carlo solvers, they introduce
correlation artifacts and bias when Green's functions are approximated. In this
paper, we propose a statistically weighted off-centered WoS-type estimator that
leverages local similarity filtering to selectively combine samples across
neighboring evaluation points. Our method balances bias and variance through a
principled weighting strategy that suppresses unreliable estimators. We
demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on various PDEs,including screened
Poisson equations and boundary conditions, achieving consistent improvements
over existing solvers such as vanilla Walk on Spheres, mean value caching, and
boundary value caching. Our method also naturally extends to gradient field
estimation and mixed boundary problems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速稳定的修剪曲面点包含查询方法，通过递归环绕数计算和椭圆边界技术提高效率，特别处理周期性参数化曲面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如光线投射和广义环绕数在鲁棒性和计算效率方面存在局限，需要更可靠的修剪曲面点包含查询方案。

Method: 采用递归环绕数计算方案，用基于椭圆的Bezier段边界替代昂贵的曲线细分，实现线性时间评估；对周期性曲面，将修剪曲线提升到通用覆盖空间。

Result: 实验显示该方法相比现有环绕数算法获得显著加速，在几何噪声、开放边界和周期性拓扑下保持高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为CAD建模、实体几何处理和曲面细分提供了高效可靠的修剪曲面点包含查询解决方案。

Abstract: Point containment queries on trimmed surfaces are fundamental to CAD
modeling, solid geometry processing, and surface tessellation. Existing
approaches such as ray casting and generalized winding numbers often face
limitations in robustness and computational efficiency.
  We propose a fast and numerically stable method for performing containment
queries on trimmed surfaces, including those with periodic parameterizations.
Our approach introduces a recursive winding number computation scheme that
replaces costly curve subdivision with an ellipse-based bound for Bezier
segments, enabling linear-time evaluation. For periodic surfaces, we lift
trimming curves to the universal covering space, allowing accurate and
consistent winding number computation even for non-contractible or
discontinuous loops in parameter domain.
  Experiments show that our method achieves substantial speedups over existing
winding-number algorithms while maintaining high robustness in the presence of
geometric noise, open boundaries, and periodic topologies. We further
demonstrate its effectiveness in processing real B-Rep models and in robust
tessellation of trimmed surfaces.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的文本到3D草图动画任务，开发了首个无需训练的框架4-Doodle，通过双空间蒸馏方案从预训练图像和视频扩散模型生成动态3D矢量草图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注逼真内容生成，而忽略了轻量级、可解释的3D矢量草图这一适合视觉通信和原型设计的媒介。该任务面临三大挑战：缺乏配对数据集、草图需要结构抽象、现有方法无法保证时间一致性和多视图一致性。

Method: 采用双空间蒸馏方案：一个空间使用可微分贝塞尔曲线捕获多视图一致的几何结构，另一个空间通过时间感知先验编码运动动态。引入多视图优化确保结构对齐，并提出结构感知运动模块分离形状保持轨迹和变形感知变化。

Result: 实验表明该方法能产生时间真实且结构稳定的3D草图动画，在保真度和可控性方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现更直观和可访问的4D内容创建迈出了重要一步，展示了在无需训练的情况下生成高质量动态3D草图的能力。

Abstract: We present a novel task: text-to-3D sketch animation, which aims to bring
freeform sketches to life in dynamic 3D space. Unlike prior works focused on
photorealistic content generation, we target sparse, stylized, and
view-consistent 3D vector sketches, a lightweight and interpretable medium
well-suited for visual communication and prototyping. However, this task is
very challenging: (i) no paired dataset exists for text and 3D (or 4D)
sketches; (ii) sketches require structural abstraction that is difficult to
model with conventional 3D representations like NeRFs or point clouds; and
(iii) animating such sketches demands temporal coherence and multi-view
consistency, which current pipelines do not address. Therefore, we propose
4-Doodle, the first training-free framework for generating dynamic 3D sketches
from text. It leverages pretrained image and video diffusion models through a
dual-space distillation scheme: one space captures multi-view-consistent
geometry using differentiable B\'ezier curves, while the other encodes motion
dynamics via temporally-aware priors. Unlike prior work (e.g., DreamFusion),
which optimizes from a single view per step, our multi-view optimization
ensures structural alignment and avoids view ambiguity, critical for sparse
sketches. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-aware motion module that
separates shape-preserving trajectories from deformation-aware changes,
enabling expressive motion such as flipping, rotation, and articulated
movement. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally
realistic and structurally stable 3D sketch animations, outperforming existing
baselines in both fidelity and controllability. We hope this work serves as a
step toward more intuitive and accessible 4D content creation.

TL;DR: mitransient是一个基于Mitsuba 3的光传输模拟工具，增加了时间分辨模拟功能，支持瞬态成像系统的快速原型开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为瞬态成像研究提供无需昂贵硬件即可进行快速原型开发的仿真工具，支持复杂物理现象的时间分辨模拟。

Method: 扩展Mitsuba 3，增加时间维度来模拟光的飞行时间，支持CPU和GPU运行，提供物理基础模拟包括多种材料和参与介质。

Result: 开发出易于安装的Python模块，支持时间分辨偏振跟踪和瞬态可微分渲染，特别为非视距成像提供简化工具。

Conclusion: mitransient将为瞬态成像算法开发提供有力支持，推动该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: mitransient is a light transport simulation tool that extends Mitsuba 3 with
support for time-resolved simulations. In essence, mitransient extends
conventional rendering by adding a temporal dimension which accounts for the
time of flight of light. This allows rapid prototyping of novel transient
imaging systems without the need of costly or difficult-to-operate hardware.
Our code is trivially easy to install through pip, and consists of Python
modules that can run both in CPU and GPU by leveraging the JIT capabilities of
Mitsuba 3. It provides physically-based simulations of complex phenomena,
including a wide variety of realistic materials and participating media such as
fog or smoke. In addition, we extend Mitsuba 3's functionality to support
time-resolved polarization tracking of light and transient differentiable
rendering. Finally, we also include tools that simplify the use of our
simulations for non-line-of-sight imaging, enabling realistic scene setups with
capture noise to be simulated in just seconds of minutes. Altogether, we hope
that mitransient will support the research community in developing novel
algorithms for transient imaging.
