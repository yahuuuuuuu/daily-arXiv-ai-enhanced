### [1] [Clustered Error Correction with Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16112)
*Taeho Kang,Jaeyeon Park,Kyungjin Lee,Youngki Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进4D高斯溅射的方法，通过椭圆误差聚类和分组4D高斯溅射来解决动态场景重建中的像素对应模糊和动态区域密度不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D高斯溅射方法在重建动态场景时存在困难，无法准确解决模糊的像素对应关系，且在动态区域缺乏足够的密度化。

Method: 方法包含两个关键组件：(1) 椭圆误差聚类和误差校正溅射添加，用于精确定位动态区域并初始化拟合溅射；(2) 分组4D高斯溅射，提高溅射与动态对象映射的一致性。通过将渲染误差分类为缺失颜色和遮挡类型，并应用基于跨视图颜色一致性的反向投影或前景分割进行针对性校正。

Result: 在Neural 3D Video和Technicolor数据集上的评估表明，该方法显著提高了时间一致性，并达到了最先进的感知渲染质量，在Technicolor光场数据集上PSNR提高了0.39dB。可视化显示溅射与动态对象的对齐得到改善，误差校正方法能够识别错误并正确初始化新溅射。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了4D高斯溅射在动态场景重建中的关键问题，通过误差聚类和分组溅射策略显著提升了渲染质量和时间一致性。

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats.

### [2] [Layer-wise Noise Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction for Robust Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16162)
*Yuting Lu,Ziliang Wang,Weixin Xu,Wei Zhang,Yongqiang Zhao,Yang Yu,Xiaohong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LNG-SWR方法，通过在训练时注入层间噪声学习频率偏置先验，并在推理时进行选择性小波重构，实现频率自适应，提升医学图像分割模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床部署需要分割模型在分布偏移和扰动下保持稳定。传统对抗训练方法存在干净-鲁棒性权衡问题，且训练/调优成本高，限制了在医学影像中的可扩展性和可维护性。

Method: LNG-SWR方法：1）训练时在多个层注入小幅度零均值噪声，学习频率偏置先验；2）推理时在输入/特征分支应用先验引导的选择性小波重构，抑制噪声敏感频带，增强方向性结构和形状线索，稳定边界响应。

Result: 在CT和超声数据集上，LNG-SWR在PGD-L∞/L2和SSAH攻击下，显著减少性能下降，同时提升干净数据的Dice/IoU指标。与对抗训练结合可获得额外增益。

Conclusion: LNG-SWR为医学图像分割提供了一个简单、有效且工程友好的鲁棒性提升路径，适用于对抗训练和标准训练两种模式。

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFit是一个基于多模态大语言模型的通用虚拟试穿框架，通过语义对齐模块和两阶段训练策略解决文本指令与参考图像间的语义差距和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在处理多样复杂任务时面临文本指令与参考图像间的语义差距，以及在复杂场景下数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 提出MLLM引导的语义对齐模块，使用多模态大语言模型和可学习查询集成多模态输入，通过语义对齐损失捕获跨模态语义关系；采用两阶段渐进训练策略和自合成流程。

Result: UniFit支持多服装和模型间试穿等多种任务，在广泛实验中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: UniFit通过多模态大语言模型的语义引导和有效的训练策略，成功构建了能够灵活处理多样化虚拟试穿任务的通用框架。

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/zwplus/UniFit.

### [4] [TetraSDF: Precise Mesh Extraction with Multi-resolution Tetrahedral Grid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16273)
*Seonghun Oh,Youngjung Uh,Jin-Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TetraSDF是一个精确的解析网格化框架，用于处理由ReLU MLP与多分辨率四面体位置编码器组成的SDF表示，能够生成与学习等值面高度一致的高质量网格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从神经SDF中提取与零水平集精确匹配的网格仍然具有挑战性，采样方法会引入离散化误差，而现有的解析方法仅适用于普通ReLU MLP。

Method: 使用四面体位置编码器的重心插值保持全局CPWA结构，在编码器诱导的多面体复合体中跟踪ReLU线性区域，并采用固定解析输入预处理器减少方向偏差和稳定训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TetraSDF在SDF重建精度上匹配或超越现有的基于网格的编码器，其解析提取器产生高度自一致的网格，保持对学习等值面的忠实度。

Conclusion: TetraSDF提供了一种实用的解析网格提取方法，具有实际运行时间和内存效率，能够生成与神经SDF零水平集精确匹配的高质量网格。

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

### [5] [EfficientSAM3: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation for Video Concept Segmentation from SAM1, 2, and 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15833)
*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Aaron Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientSAM3通过渐进式分层蒸馏技术将SAM3的能力转移到轻量级模型，实现设备端概念分割和跟踪，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3的统一架构（共享视觉骨干、DETR风格检测器、密集内存跟踪器）在设备端使用过于昂贵，需要开发高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用渐进式分层蒸馏（PHD）三阶段方法：编码器蒸馏、时序内存蒸馏和端到端微调，使用RepViT、TinyViT和EfficientViT等轻量级骨干网络。

Result: 在流行VOS数据集上获得强大的性能-效率权衡，实现了设备端概念分割和跟踪。

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3通过渐进式分层蒸馏成功将SAM3能力转移到轻量级模型，为设备端视觉理解提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

TL;DR: Texture3dgs是一个针对移动GPU优化的3D高斯泼溅算法，通过新颖的排序算法和内存优化，在移动设备上实现了更快的3D场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将3D高斯泼溅算法部署到移动设备上，以利用移动设备的优势（数据隐私、无需网络连接、更快响应），但面临移动GPU二维纹理缓存优化的挑战。

Method: 开发了针对2D内存优化的新型排序算法，改进了变量布局设计，并进行了其他优化来加速3DGS算法的各个步骤。

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出四种改进模型基6D位姿估计的新方法：动态非均匀密集采样、多假设推理、迭代优化和遮挡训练增强，在遮挡场景下显著提升精度和速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有6D物体位姿估计方法在遮挡情况下早期检测阶段容易出错，导致误差传播的问题

Method: 动态非均匀密集采样策略、多假设推理机制、迭代优化和遮挡训练增强，以及新的加权可见性评估指标

Result: 在ICBIN数据集上精度提升超过5%，BOP数据集上提升超过2%，推理速度提升约3倍

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了遮挡场景下的6D位姿估计性能，在精度和速度方面均有显著改进

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartUV是一个基于部件分解的UV展开方法，针对AI生成网格的噪声和不良条件问题，通过语义部件分解和几何启发式方法生成更少、部件对齐的图表，同时保持低失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: PartUV提供了一个有效的部件基UV展开解决方案，显著减少了图表碎片化，改善了AI生成网格的UV展开质量，为下游任务提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

### [9] [Automatic Uncertainty-Aware Synthetic Data Bootstrapping for Historical Map Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15875)
*Lukas Arzoumanidis,Julius Knechtel,Jan-Henrik Haunert,Youness Dehbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过风格迁移生成合成历史地图的方法，解决历史地图分析中训练数据稀缺的问题，并评估了该方法在语义分割任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图分析通常缺乏足够的标注训练数据，而合成数据往往缺乏真实性和多样性。本文旨在通过风格迁移生成逼真的合成历史地图来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了自动深度生成方法和手动随机退化技术，将原始历史地图的风格转移到矢量数据上，生成具有视觉不确定性和噪声的合成地图。

Result: 生成的训练数据集被用于基于自构建图卷积网络的领域自适应语义分割，证明了数据引导方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决历史地图分析中训练数据稀缺的问题，为同质地图语料库的语义分割任务提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box6D是一种针对仓库场景中存储箱的类别级6D姿态估计方法，通过单次RGB-D观测快速推断箱子尺寸并使用类别CAD模板估计姿态，显著降低推理时间76%的同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仓库自动化、箱拣选等场景中，现有6D姿态估计方法在灵活性、精度和效率方面的不足：基于模型的方法需要精确CAD模型且泛化差；无模型方法在复杂条件下易失败；类别级方法过于通用且忽略环境先验。

Method: 使用快速二分搜索从单次RGB-D观测推断箱子尺寸，基于类别CAD模板而非实例特定模型估计姿态，采用深度合理性过滤器和早停策略拒绝不合理假设以降低计算成本。

Result: 在真实仓库场景和公共基准测试中，Box6D实现了竞争性或更优的6D姿态精度，同时将推理时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: Box6D为仓库环境中的存储箱6D姿态估计提供了一种高效准确的解决方案，平衡了灵活性、精度和计算效率，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段自改进范式，通过自生成详细文本推理来弥合视觉语言模型在领域特定视频分类中的语义差距，无需新标注即可显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在领域特定视频分类任务中表现不佳，特别是数据有限时，存在关键的"推理差距"——稀疏的领域数据不足以弥合复杂时空内容与抽象分类标签之间的语义距离

Method: 两阶段自改进范式：1) 提示VLMs为每个视频生成详细文本推理，迫使其阐述领域特定逻辑；2) 在这些自生成推理上微调VLM，利用中间监督使其表示与目标领域细节对齐；3) 在任务标签上进行常规监督微调

Result: 在多样化数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于直接监督微调，验证了自生成推理作为适应VLMs到领域特定视频分析的有效、标注高效范式

Conclusion: 自生成推理是一种有效的、标注高效的范式，能够帮助VLMs适应领域特定的视频分析任务，弥合语义差距并显著提升性能

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了MGLL框架，通过多粒度语言学习改进多标签和跨粒度对齐，在医学影像等复杂领域超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等现有方法专注于单标签、单粒度对齐，但在医学影像等复杂领域，图像通常对应多个高层标签和不同粒度标注，需要更强大的多粒度对齐能力

Method: MGLL框架利用结构化多标签监督，整合跨粒度文本描述，引入带点约束的软标签监督，使用平滑KL散度确保跨粒度一致性，作为即插即用模块保持计算效率

Result: 在构建的大规模多粒度数据集上预训练，并在多个数据集上评估，MGLL在下游任务中优于其他最先进方法

Conclusion: MGLL通过多粒度语言学习有效解决了复杂领域中的多标签和跨粒度对齐问题，为医学影像等应用提供了更强大的视觉语言模型

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从3D心脏超声体积中自动选择标准2D视图的方法，让医生能以熟悉的2D格式解读3D扫描数据，同时保持诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然心脏具有复杂的三维解剖结构，但传统的心脏超声成像依赖于一系列显示单个心脏结构的2D视频。3D超声心动图是一种新兴模式，现在提供了足够用于临床的图像质量，有潜力简化采集过程并改善对非轴线特征的评估。

Method: 应用深度学习视图分类器和基于解剖标志的下游启发式方法，结合心脏病专家提供的启发式规则，重建标准超声心动图视图。

Result: 在盲法评估中，三位心脏病专家验证了该方法（在来自2家医院的1,600个视频中准确率达到96%）。提取的2D视频在检测心脏异常和生成临床级心脏解剖测量方面也得到了验证。

Conclusion: 提取的2D视频保留了空间校准和诊断特征，使临床医生能够从3D体积中获得准确的真实世界解释。

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛评估验证了InfoCLIP在增强CLIP微调用于开放词汇语义分割方面的有效性，展示了其在非对称迁移中的适应性和优越性。

Conclusion: InfoCLIP通过信息论方法成功地将预训练CLIP的对齐知识迁移到分割任务中，避免了过拟合问题，提升了开放词汇语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

Conclusion: 公平感知上下文学习为公平医学图像推理提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

Conclusion: 利用图表示和样本间关系能有效提升长尾分布数据集中的OOD检测性能，特别是在尾类样本上表现优异。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

Conclusion: AMS-KV通过智能的KV缓存策略有效解决了视觉自回归模型中的内存瓶颈问题，显著提升了模型的扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

Abstract: Traditional video reasoning segmentation methods rely on supervised fine-tuning, which limits generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios and lacks explicit reasoning. To address this, we propose \textbf{VideoSeg-R1}, the first framework to introduce reinforcement learning into video reasoning segmentation. It adopts a decoupled architecture that formulates the task as joint referring image segmentation and video mask propagation. It comprises three stages: (1) A hierarchical text-guided frame sampler to emulate human attention; (2) A reasoning model that produces spatial cues along with explicit reasoning chains; and (3) A segmentation-propagation stage using SAM2 and XMem. A task difficulty-aware mechanism adaptively controls reasoning length for better efficiency and accuracy. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VideoSeg-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex video reasoning and segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI分类通常涉及大规模数据和计算密集型训练，限制了深度学习模型在实际遥感任务中的部署。需要开发高效的训练方法。

Method: 集成课程学习与PCA光谱降维，逐步引入光谱复杂性同时保留关键信息，实现高效的光谱-空间模式学习。框架独立于具体架构、优化器和损失函数。

Conclusion: 训练策略优化是HSI模型架构设计的有效补充，SpectralTrain为实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Abstract: We present Rad-GS, a 4D radar-camera SLAM system designed for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, utilizing 3D Gaussian as a differentiable spatial representation. Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar. Real-world reconstruction at kilometer scale validates the potential of Rad-GS for large-scale scene reconstruction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当视觉提示和目标图像来自不同视觉任务时，视觉语言模型是否仍能实现视觉上下文学习，探索跨任务VICL的潜力。

Method: 设计机制生成和选择能隐式描述两个不同低层视觉任务差异的文本提示，构建跨任务VICL数据集，并提出结合感知评分推理和传统评估指标的新型推理框架。

Result: 在9个跨任务场景中取得顶级结果，在另外10个场景中取得次优表现，突破了视觉语言模型中跨任务VICL的边界。

Conclusion: T2T-VICL框架成功解锁了视觉语言模型在跨任务视觉上下文学习中的能力，证明了跨任务VICL的可行性。

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

*Tianxiong Zhong,Xingye Tian,Xuebo Wang,Boyuan Jiang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCS-LDM提出了一种新的视觉生成范式，通过构建层次化、尺度无关的潜在空间，将信息复杂度与尺度解耦，支持在固定潜在表示下解码到任意分辨率和帧率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型通常将尺度与内容复杂度耦合，使用更多潜在令牌来表示更高分辨率的图像或更高帧率的视频。但视觉数据所需的潜在容量主要取决于内容复杂度，而尺度仅作为上限。

Method: 构建层次化、尺度无关的潜在空间，通过多级令牌建模样本复杂度，支持在固定潜在表示下解码到任意分辨率和帧率，实现渐进式从粗到细的生成范式。

Result: 实验结果表明，DCS-LDM在提供跨不同尺度和视觉质量的灵活生成的同时，实现了与最先进方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: DCS-LDM成功解耦了信息复杂度与尺度，实现了灵活的计算-质量权衡，支持渐进式生成和跨尺度生成能力。

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

### [33] [VTinker: Guided Flow Upsampling and Texture Mapping for High-Resolution Video Frame Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16124)
*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker提出了一种新的视频帧插值流水线，通过引导流上采样和纹理映射来解决高分辨率运动估计中的模糊和伪影问题，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于光流的视频帧插值方法在低分辨率预测双向流后使用高倍率上采样，会导致流边缘模糊或马赛克，且无法充分捕捉高分辨率下的精细像素运动，导致插值帧出现重影和不连续性。

Method: VTinker包含两个核心组件：引导流上采样(GFU)使用输入帧作为引导来减轻双线性上采样流的模糊细节；纹理映射生成中间代理帧，从输入帧选择清晰纹理块映射到代理上，通过重建模块生成最终插值帧。

Result: 大量实验证明VTinker在视频帧插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VTinker通过引导流上采样和纹理映射有效解决了高分辨率视频帧插值中的运动估计问题，显著提升了插值质量。

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PiN-CLIP方法，通过在特征空间中注入正激励噪声来抑制虚假捷径，增强AI生成图像检测的泛化能力，在42种生成模型的数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展使得真实图像和合成图像越来越难以区分。尽管已有大量AI生成图像检测方法，但分布外泛化仍然是一个持续挑战。研究发现这是由于训练过程中利用了虚假捷径导致的。

Method: 提出PiN-CLIP方法，联合训练噪声生成器和检测网络，通过交叉注意力融合视觉和类别语义特征构建特征空间中的正激励噪声。在优化过程中将噪声注入特征空间来微调视觉编码器，抑制捷径敏感方向同时放大稳定的取证线索。

Result: 在包含42种不同生成模型合成的开放世界数据集上进行比较实验，该方法实现了新的最先进性能，平均准确率比现有方法提高了5.4个百分点。

Conclusion: PiN-CLIP方法通过特征空间的正激励噪声注入，能够有效抑制虚假捷径，提取更鲁棒和泛化的伪影表示，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练退化表示学习的盲视频质量增强方法，通过解耦和提取多尺度退化表示来指导伪影去除，并引入分层终止机制动态调整计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QECV方法依赖已知QP参数，在真实场景中QP可能未知；当前盲方法只能捕获全局退化信息，缺乏空间细节；现有方法在不同QP下使用统一架构，忽略了计算需求的差异。

Method: 预训练退化表示学习模块提取高维多尺度退化表示；分层终止机制根据压缩级别动态调整伪影减少阶段数量。

Result: 在QP=22时PSNR提升110%（从0.31dB到0.65dB）；分层终止机制在QP=22时推理时间比QP=42减少一半。

Conclusion: 该方法在盲视频质量增强任务中显著提升了性能，同时通过动态调整计算资源提高了效率。

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

Conclusion: SR3D框架通过解决训练-推理不一致性问题，显著提升了室内点云3D目标检测的性能，同时保持了实时处理能力。

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率水体变化检测数据集稀缺，且现有深度学习方法未能充分利用深度特征中的空间语义和结构信息。

Method: 设计了SSCP注意力模块，包含多语义空间注意力(MSA)、结构关系感知全局注意力(SRGA)和通道自注意力(CSA)三个组件，可集成到现有WBCD模型中。

Result: 在提出的HSRW-CD和Water-CD数据集上的大量实验验证了SSCP的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSCP模块能够充分利用水体特征的空间语义和结构信息，显著提升水体变化检测的判别能力。

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM成功实现了实时开放词汇语义映射，解决了3DGS SLAM中的语义理解挑战，为高级机器人交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

Result: 在MMEB基准测试中，推理引导的条件化使多模态检索性能比非推理基线提高了4.9%

Conclusion: 显式推理可以有效增强嵌入质量，将生成推理过程融入嵌入提取是提升多模态表示的有效方法

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的verbose-text诱导攻击(VTIA)，通过两阶段框架在良性图像中注入难以察觉的对抗扰动，以最大化视觉语言模型的输出令牌长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在多模态任务上的显著成功，其部署效率问题日益突出。现有方法仅延迟EOS令牌的出现来隐式延长输出，缺乏稳定性和可控性，无法直接最大化输出令牌长度作为显式优化目标。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 对抗提示搜索，使用强化学习策略自动识别能诱导LLM组件产生冗长输出的对抗提示；2) 视觉对齐扰动优化，在输入图像上构建对抗样本，最大化扰动图像视觉嵌入与对抗提示嵌入之间的相似性。

Result: 在四个流行的视觉语言模型上的综合实验表明，该方法在有效性、效率和泛化能力方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 提出的VTIA攻击能够有效诱导视觉语言模型生成冗长文本输出，为解决模型部署效率问题提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: EvoVLA是一个自监督的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过阶段对齐奖励、基于姿态的对象探索和长时程记忆三个组件，解决了VLA模型在长时程机器人操作中的阶段幻觉问题，显著提升了任务成功率和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在长时程机器人操作中存在阶段幻觉问题，即智能体利用粗略评估信号来走捷径完成多步任务，报告高进度但未真正完成任务。

Method: 提出三个互补组件：1）阶段对齐奖励（SAR），使用三元组对比学习和Gemini生成的困难负样本来防止视觉捷径；2）基于姿态的对象探索（POE），在相对对象-夹爪姿态而非原始像素上建立好奇心；3）长时程记忆，使用选择性上下文保留和门控融合来稳定扩展回合中的内在塑造。

Result: 在Discoverse-L基准测试中，EvoVLA比最强基线（OpenVLA-OFT）平均任务成功率提高10.2个百分点，达到69.2%，样本效率提高1.5倍，阶段幻觉从38.5%降至14.8%。在真实机器人部署中，平均成功率54.6%，比OpenVLA-OFT高11个百分点。

Conclusion: EvoVLA有效解决了VLA模型的阶段幻觉问题，实现了有效的模拟到真实世界迁移和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

Motivation: 现有方法很少从可解释性机制角度研究CLIP在密集预测中的性能边界。研究发现CLIP存在类似人类注意力分散的现象，将大量注意力资源从目标区域转移到无关token上。

Method: 提出RF-CLIP（重聚焦CLIP），一种无需训练的方法，通过过滤维度特定的过度激活token，将注意力从分散token重定向回目标区域，从而改进CLIP的多模态对齐粒度。

Result: 在八个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时保持高推理效率。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类注意力分散-重聚焦行为，可以有效提升CLIP在密集预测任务中的多模态对齐能力，为开放词汇语义分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

TL;DR: Mantis框架通过解耦视觉预测与主干网络，结合元查询和扩散Transformer，在保持语言理解能力的同时提升动作学习效果，在机器人任务中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 现有VLA模型直接预测高维视觉状态会分散模型能力且训练成本高，而压缩视觉状态会造成信息瓶颈，同时忽视语言监督导致理解和推理能力不足。

Method: 提出Mantis框架，采用解耦视觉预测(DVF)，通过元查询和扩散Transformer头将视觉预测从主干网络分离，结合残差连接实现下一状态预测，自动捕捉潜在动作。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中达到96.7%成功率，超越现有基线模型，收敛速度快。真实世界评估中在指令跟随、泛化能力和推理能力方面优于π₀.₅模型。

Conclusion: Mantis通过解耦视觉预测有效减轻了VLA主干网络负担，在保持语言理解能力的同时显著提升了动作学习和任务执行性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VI-ReID算法在公共数据集上表现良好，但在真实世界应用中因数据差异而表现不佳，需要解决无监督域自适应问题。

Method: 两阶段模型：预训练阶段使用域共享学习策略(DSLS)缓解域间模态差异；微调阶段使用渐进对齐策略(GAS)通过聚类到整体的方式处理域内跨模态对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法显著优于现有的VI-ReID域自适应方法，甚至在某些设置下优于有监督方法。

Conclusion: DSLGA方法有效解决了UDA-VI-ReID中的跨域和跨模态挑战，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

Motivation: 人类器官由相互连接的子结构组成，其几何形状和空间关系相互制约。现有深度学习方法通常独立处理这些部分，导致解剖学上不合理的重建结果。

Method: 从连接的模板开始，PrIntMesh联合变形所有子结构以匹配患者特定解剖结构，明确保持内部边界并强制生成光滑、无伪影的表面。

Result: 在心脏、海马体和肺部验证中，PrIntMesh实现了高几何精度、正确拓扑结构，即使在有限或噪声训练数据下也能保持稳健性能。相比基于体素和表面的方法，能更好地重建共享界面并保持结构一致性。

Conclusion: PrIntMesh提供了一个数据高效的解决方案，适合临床应用，能够产生解剖学上更合理的器官重建结果。

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了VLA模型在多模态对抗攻击下的脆弱性，强调了在具身AI系统中加强多模态鲁棒性的重要性

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Conclusion: ICCE是首个在ImageNet上超过70%准确率的完全无监督图像分类方法，证明了聚类集成策略的有效性

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

Method: 构建了包含同步视频和文本的多模态数据集，提出社交思维链推理流程和动态社交认知记忆模块，建立了包含12个先进MLLM的综合基准。

Result: 所有评估模型在欺骗识别任务上表现不佳，即使GPT-4o也难以可靠区分真假。失败模式分析显示模型无法有效将语言与多模态社交线索关联，缺乏对他人知识、信念或意图的建模能力。

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

Conclusion: SwiTrack通过状态切换框架有效解决了跨模态目标跟踪中的特征提取和目标漂移问题，实现了鲁棒的实时跟踪性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效解决AR/VR应用中全身体跟踪不完整的问题，通过Memory-Block和多任务学习实现了更好的运动预测性能。

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

Abstract: We present a fast, spatio-temporal scene understanding framework based on Vision Gated Generative Transformers (VGGT). The proposed pipeline is designed to enable efficient, close to real-time performance, supporting applications including assistive navigation. To achieve continuous updates of the 3D scene representation, we process the image flow with a sliding window, aligning submaps, thereby overcoming VGGT's high memory demands. We exploit the VGGT tracking head to aggregate 2D semantic instance masks into 3D objects. To allow for temporal consistency and richer contextual reasoning the system stores timestamps and instance-level identities, thereby enabling the detection of changes in the environment. We evaluate the approach on well-known benchmarks and custom datasets specifically designed for assistive navigation scenarios. The results demonstrate the applicability of the framework to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

*Minseok Seo,Mark Hamilton,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Upsample Anything是一个轻量级测试时优化框架，无需训练即可将低分辨率特征恢复为高分辨率像素级输出，通过各向异性高斯核结合空间和范围线索实现边缘感知的上采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型虽然在下游任务中表现出强大的泛化能力，但其表示通常被下采样14x/16x，限制了在像素级应用中的直接使用。现有特征上采样方法依赖数据集特定重训练或繁重的隐式优化，限制了可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 通过简单的每图像优化学习各向异性高斯核，结合空间和范围线索，有效桥接高斯泼溅和联合双边上采样。学习到的核作为通用边缘感知算子，可在架构和模态间无缝迁移。

Conclusion: Upsample Anything提供了一种高效、通用的特征上采样解决方案，无需训练即可实现精确的高分辨率重建。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

TL;DR: 将稀疏自编码器(SAE)重新理解为主题模型，提出SAE-TM框架，将SAE特征作为可重用的主题原子，在文本和图像数据集上生成更连贯的主题，并应用于跨模态的大规模主题分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在嵌入分析中的作用和实际价值存在争议，需要新的视角来理解其本质和应用价值。

Method: 将潜在狄利克雷分配扩展到嵌入空间，推导出SAE目标作为该模型的最大后验估计器，并开发SAE-TM框架：训练SAE学习可重用主题原子，将其解释为下游数据的词分布，无需重新训练即可合并成任意数量的主题。

Result: SAE-TM在文本和图像数据集上比强基线方法产生更连贯的主题，同时保持多样性，成功分析了图像数据集中的主题结构并追踪了日本木版画中主题随时间的变化。

Conclusion: SAE可以作为跨模态大规模主题分析的有效工具，为理解嵌入空间中的主题结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: NaTex是一个原生纹理生成框架，直接在3D空间中预测纹理颜色，避免了传统多视图扩散方法的局限性，通过将纹理视为密集颜色点云来实现更好的纹理对齐和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于多视图扩散(MVD)方法在处理遮挡区域、实现精确网格-纹理对齐以及保持跨视图一致性和颜色强度一致性方面的固有局限性。

Method: 提出潜在颜色扩散，包括几何感知的颜色点云VAE和多控制扩散变换器(DiT)，完全使用3D数据从头训练。引入原生几何控制，通过位置嵌入和几何潜在变量为DiT提供直接3D空间信息。

Result: NaTex表现出强大的性能，在纹理一致性和对齐方面显著优于先前方法，并展现出强大的泛化能力，可用于材质生成、纹理优化和部件分割等下游应用。

Conclusion: NaTex通过原生3D纹理生成方法有效解决了传统2D多视图方法的局限性，为纹理生成提供了更精确和一致的解决方案。

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

Conclusion: WWE-UIE通过整合三个可解释先验，提供了一种紧凑高效的水下图像增强解决方案，在保持高质量恢复的同时实现了实时性能，消融研究和可视化验证了各组件贡献。

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

TL;DR: ChangeDINO是一个用于光学建筑变化检测的多尺度Siamese框架，通过融合轻量级骨干网络和冻结的DINOv3特征，结合空间-光谱差分transformer解码器和可学习形态学模块，在多个公开基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的遥感变化检测方法主要依赖变化图标注，未能充分利用非变化区域的语义信息，导致在光照变化、离天底视角和标签稀缺情况下鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: ChangeDINO通过有效利用语义信息和多尺度特征融合，显著提升了建筑变化检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: ARASFSR通过三个创新设计成功实现了任意分辨率和任意尺度的人脸超分辨率，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

Conclusion: MOMNet为不对齐RGB-D场景提供了有效的深度超分辨率解决方案，通过自适应特征匹配和选择机制克服了传统方法对严格空间对齐的依赖。

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

Conclusion: 强调局部结构匹配不仅提升性能还增强模型可解释性，结合泛化能力和可解释性显著增强了DetailSemNet在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.

Conclusion: CAMS通过提取视觉特征的语义特征并在多维空间中进行语义解缠，有效提升了未见属性-对象组合的识别能力。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 基于图的分割方法通过结合ViT的全局上下文和图的关系推理，提高了手术场景分割的性能和解剖一致性，为更安全的腹腔镜和机器人辅助手术提供了精确的关键解剖特征识别方法。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语言驱动的属性泛化（LDAG）架构，通过利用目标类别的固有属性语言描述来构建鲁棒的支持策略，以解决小样本分割中由于类内变化导致的元引导不准确问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小样本分割方法主要从支持图像中挖掘参考信息作为元引导，但由于视觉表示的类内变化，从支持图像中提取的元信息无法为未训练类别提供准确的分割指导。作者认为支持图像提供的参考可能不是必需的，关键是要为训练和未训练类别提供无偏的元引导。

Method: 提出LDAG架构，包含两个核心模块：1）多属性增强（MaE）模块，通过大语言模型生成目标类别的多个详细属性描述，并利用多模态匹配构建精细的视觉-文本先验引导；2）多模态属性对齐（MaA）模块，实现属性文本与视觉特征之间的跨模态交互，解决文本-视觉模态偏移问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法明显优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过语言驱动的属性泛化方法，能够为小样本分割提供更鲁棒和无偏的支持策略，有效解决了传统方法中由于类内变化导致的元引导不准确问题。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有垃圾检测数据集缺乏对垃圾容器监控的专门标注，且多为静态环境数据，无法满足智能城市垃圾管理中的实际物流需求。

Method: 构建StreetView-Waste数据集，包含三个评估任务；提出基于启发式的方法改进容器跟踪，以及利用几何先验的模型无关框架优化垃圾分割。

Result: 微调的目标检测器在容器检测上表现良好，但基线跟踪方法计数准确率低；提出的启发式方法将平均绝对计数误差降低79.6%；几何感知策略在轻量模型上将分割mAP@0.5提升27%。

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste为城市垃圾管理的实际感知系统研究提供了具有挑战性的基准，展示了多模态输入在该任务中的价值。

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-Pruner是一种专门针对Vision-Language-Action模型的token剪枝方法，通过双级重要性标准和自适应token选择策略，在保持计算效率的同时提升VLA模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLM token剪枝方法仅基于语义显著性选择token，忽略了VLA模型的双系统特性（高层语义理解和低层动作执行），导致动作生成所需的关键信息被丢弃，严重影响VLA性能。

Method: 提出双级重要性标准：视觉语言预填充注意力用于语义级相关性，通过时间平滑估计的动作解码注意力用于动作级重要性。基于此标准设计自适应双级token选择策略，在给定计算预算下保留紧凑且信息丰富的视觉token。

Result: 实验表明VLA-Pruner在多种VLA架构和多样化机器人任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VLA-Pruner通过考虑VLA模型的双系统特性和机器人操作的时间连续性，有效解决了现有token剪枝方法在VLA任务中的局限性，为高效VLA部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Result: 在3D视觉问答和3D语言定位任务上表现优于之前的2D基础VLM解决方案。

Conclusion: 仅使用多视角2D图像即可有效提升VLM的3D场景理解能力，无需额外3D训练数据或模型微调。

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis have enabled real-time rendering speeds with high reconstruction accuracy. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), a foundational point-based parametric 3D scene representation, models scenes as large sets of 3D Gaussians. However, complex scenes can consist of millions of Gaussians, resulting in high storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which Gaussians to remove. At high compression ratios, these pruned scenes suffer from heavy degradation of visual fidelity and loss of foreground details. In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing its training pipeline. After pruning 90% of Gaussians, a substantially higher percentage than previous methods, our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases average rendering speed by 3.56$\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than existing techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 视频预测是机器人和世界建模等下游应用的基础任务，但遮挡问题仍然是视频预测中的固有挑战。作者假设通过提供明确的运动信息（点流）和几何结构信息（深度图）能够改善遮挡和背景运动情况下的预测效果。

Method: 采用标准的多对象潜在变换器架构来预测未来帧，但修改该架构以融入深度和点流信息。在合成和真实世界数据集上进行受控评估，使用基于外观的指标和对象掩码的Wasserstein距离来有效测量预测的运动分布。

Result: 研究发现，当预测模型辅助以点流和深度信息时，在遮挡场景下表现更好，并且相比不使用这些模态的模型，能够预测更准确的背景运动。

Conclusion: 通过引入点流和深度信息可以有效提升视频预测模型在遮挡场景下的性能，特别是在背景运动预测方面表现更佳。

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

Conclusion: 利用图像采集时间信息可以有效改进乳腺DCE-MRI肿瘤分割，FiLM层提供了一种轻量级的方法来整合时间信息，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

Conclusion: SemCLIP能够显著提高对语义变换的鲁棒性，特别是对否定文本的处理能力，同时保持原始CLIP的性能。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的多摄像机体操运动员跟踪方法，通过结合体操领域知识（运动员通常在垂直平面内运动），在检测不足时采用射线-平面相交法生成3D轨迹候选，有效解决了传统三角测量在有限摄像机下的跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体操运动员跟踪面临独特挑战：体育馆空间限制导致摄像机数量有限；光照、背景、服装变化和遮挡导致多视角检测可能失效，通常只有两个相对视角能提供有效检测，这使传统多摄像机三角测量难以准确确定3D轨迹。

Method: 提出级联数据关联范式：当交叉视角检测充足时使用三角测量生成3D轨迹候选；当检测不足时采用射线-平面相交法生成共面3D轨迹候选。利用体操运动员3D中心通常在预定义垂直平面内运动的领域知识。

Result: 通过广泛实验验证了方法的鲁棒性，在挑战性场景中优于现有方法。该跟踪方法已成功应用于最近的体操世锦赛，获得国际体操联合会的高度认可。

Conclusion: 结合体操领域知识的多摄像机跟踪方法能有效补偿不确定轨迹，最小化跟踪失败，为体操裁判系统提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段的合成图像检测框架，通过对比学习提取特征嵌入，结合k-NN分类器在少样本学习范式下实现跨生成器的泛化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速发展导致合成图像难以与真实内容区分，传统检测方法依赖定期重新训练，在新型生成模型快速迭代下计算不可行且操作不实用。

Method: 第一阶段使用监督对比学习训练视觉深度学习模型提取特征嵌入，第二阶段使用k-NN分类器在嵌入空间进行少样本学习，仅需每个类别150张图像。

Result: 在少样本学习下达到91.3%的平均检测准确率，比现有方法提升5.2个百分点；在源归属任务中，AUC和OSCR分别提升14.70%和4.27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建鲁棒、可扩展的取证归属系统提供了重要进展，能够适应不断演化的生成AI环境，无需大量重新训练。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Conclusion: EOGS++成功提升了卫星图像3D重建的性能，保持了高斯泼溅的计算优势，同时通过集成束调整和多种改进措施实现了更好的几何精度。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting. Our model demonstrates an improvement from 1.33 to 1.19 mean MAE errors on buildings compared to the original EOGS models

TL;DR: VARiant通过权重共享和渐进式训练策略，在VAR模型中实现了灵活的网络深度调整，显著降低了内存消耗和推理时间，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型的多尺度生成导致累积KV缓存带来巨大内存开销，限制了实际部署。研究发现VAR模型存在尺度-深度不对称依赖：早期尺度对网络深度极其敏感，而后期尺度对深度减少具有鲁棒性。

Method: 从30层VAR网络中通过等距采样选择多个子网络（16层到2层）。早期尺度使用完整网络处理，后期尺度使用子网络。子网络与完整网络共享权重，实现单一模型内的灵活深度调整。采用渐进式训练策略解决权重共享带来的优化冲突。

Result: 在ImageNet上，VARiant-d16和VARiant-d8达到接近原始VAR-d30的质量（FID 2.05/2.12 vs 1.95），同时减少40-65%内存消耗。VARiant-d2实现3.5倍加速和80%内存减少，质量适度下降（FID 2.97）。

Conclusion: VARiant的单模型架构支持零成本运行时深度切换，提供从高质量到极致效率的灵活部署选项，满足多样化应用场景需求。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module. We further propose a three-stage training strategy on million-scale data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

TL;DR: 提出自适应引导上采样(AGU)方法，用于低光照图像的高效上采样，能同时优化降噪和锐化等多个图像质量特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有引导图像方法在处理低光照图像时效果不佳，因为低光照图像噪声高、亮度低，缺乏足够的特征用于引导传输。

Method: 基于多参数优化，学习低光照与明亮图像特征之间的关联，使用机器学习方法从少量图像对样本中学习特征。

Result: AGU能够使用低质量、低分辨率输入实时渲染高质量图像，实验证明在低光照场景下优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: AGU方法有效解决了低光照图像引导上采样的挑战，实现了实时高质量图像渲染。

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

TL;DR: Cambrian-S提出的视频空间超感知基准测试(VSR和VSC)存在缺陷，通过简单基线方法NoSense和VSC-Repeat测试发现这些基准无法可靠衡量空间超感知能力，Cambrian-S的方法可能利用了基准中的捷径启发式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对Cambrian-S提出的视频空间超感知基准和方法进行批判性分析，验证这些基准是否真正衡量空间认知和世界建模能力。

Method: 1) 引入NoSense基线方法，仅使用词袋SigLIP模型，几乎忽略时间结构；2) 设计VSC-Repeat测试，将视频与自身拼接1-5次，测试系统对重复场景的识别能力。

Result: 1) NoSense在VSR基准上达到95%准确率，表明该基准无需空间认知即可解决；2) VSC-Repeat测试使Cambrian-S的平均相对准确率从42%降至0%，表明其依赖房间不重复访问的捷径。

Conclusion: 当前VSI-Super基准无法可靠衡量空间超感知，Cambrian-S的方法性能提升主要来自利用基准捷径而非真正的空间超感知能力。

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

Result: 在ISIC分割中，遗忘集IoU从0.875降至0.509，同时保留集和验证集性能保持竞争力；在ISIC分类中，遗忘集准确率从87.0%降至64.1%，保留集准确率从83.9%提升至90.6%。

Conclusion: 基于LoRA的子空间遗忘为医学图像分析提供了负责任、可控且可逆的遗忘途径，使模型能够遗忘敏感样本或结构，同时保持关键性能。

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

Conclusion: 这是开发、解释和压缩混合Mamba-Transformer架构的初步探索，为混合模型可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的目标检测面临长尾分布挑战，即多数类别只有少量实例，导致模型偏向频繁类别，在稀有类别上性能下降。

Method: 采用两阶段Faster R-CNN架构，改进平衡组Softmax框架缓解类别不平衡，并探索度量学习生成特征嵌入，使用k-NN进行推理。

Result: 在LVISv1数据集上达到24.5%的mAP，超越之前24.0%的基准，特别在稀有类别上分类性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在长尾目标检测中有效，平衡组Softmax和度量学习的结合能够显著改善稀有类别的检测性能。

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

Conclusion: SurvAgent为精准肿瘤学中的可解释AI驱动生存预测建立了新范式。

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

Conclusion: TRIM在不影响输出质量的前提下，有效加速了3D高斯扩散模型的推理过程，支持推理时的缩放。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

Motivation: 传统非结构化剪枝方法需要多次迭代的训练-剪枝-再训练循环，计算开销巨大。为了解决这个问题，需要开发更高效的剪枝方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个计算效率高、性能保持好的解决方案，特别适合在资源受限的环境中部署。

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效缓解了多层级冲突和类别不平衡问题，为3D层次语义分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner通过创新的表示方法和训练策略，成功实现了准确灵活的多物体9自由度姿态控制，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Conclusion: VNEP任务和VANS模型成功地将视频作为新的回答模态，为程序性学习和创造性探索提供了更直观的解决方案。

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: DualMindVLM显著优于基础模型，性能与最先进的视觉推理模型相当，同时保持了极高的token效率。

Conclusion: 提出的简单RL方法成功实现了视觉语言模型的快慢思考模式切换，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升了计算效率。

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了EvoLMM框架，通过两个协作代理（提问者和解答者）实现大型多模态模型的自我进化，无需人工标注数据或奖励模型，在数学推理基准上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型训练依赖人工标注数据或外部奖励模型，限制了自主性和可扩展性。本文旨在以纯无监督方式提升模型推理能力。

Method: 从单一骨干模型实例化两个协作代理：提问者生成多样化的图像相关问题，解答者通过内部一致性解决这些问题，实现持续自我奖励的学习过程。

Result: 以Qwen2.5-VL为基础模型，在ChartQA、MathVista和MathVision等多模态数学推理基准上获得约3%的稳定提升，仅使用原始训练图像。

Conclusion: 这种简单有效的方法为完全无监督环境下自我改进的大型多模态模型研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

*Jing Wen,Alexander G. Schwing,Shenlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPo-Avatar：一种无需姿态输入即可从单张或稀疏图像重建可动画3D人体化身的创新方法，解决了传统方法对噪声姿态估计敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖准确的相机姿态和人体姿态作为输入，但在实际应用中姿态估计往往存在噪声，导致重建质量显著下降。需要开发不依赖姿态输入的重建方法。

Method: 提出NoPo-Avatar，完全从图像重建化身，无需任何姿态输入。通过消除重建过程对测试时人体姿态的依赖，避免噪声姿态估计的影响。

Result: 在THuman2.0、XHuman和HuGe100K数据集上的实验表明，NoPo-Avatar在实际设置（无真实姿态）中优于现有基线，在实验室设置（有真实姿态）中也能获得相当的结果。

Conclusion: NoPo-Avatar通过消除对姿态输入的依赖，为3D人体化身重建提供了更广泛适用的解决方案，特别是在姿态估计不准确的现实场景中表现优异。

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

Motivation: 在虚拟环境中提供准确的力反馈对于增强沉浸感至关重要，但多物理场系统的实时物理模拟计算量大，特别是在需要实时交互的情况下具有挑战性。

Method: 集成平滑粒子流体动力学(SPH)与双向力耦合和反馈平滑技术，将流体、软体和刚体动力学统一到单一平台中。

Result: 实现了稳定的触觉交互，用户能够操纵浸入流体中的物体并感受到与流体-结构行为一致的反作用力，展示了流体搅拌、软组织操纵和刚体交互等场景。

Conclusion: 该框架推进了触觉启用的多物理场模拟，为沉浸式教育应用提供了统一的流体、软体和刚体动力学平台。

Abstract: Haptic feedback enhances immersion in virtual environments by allowing users to physically interact with simulated objects. Supporting accurate force responses in multiphysics systems is challenging because physically based simulation of fluid, rigid, and deformable materials is computationally demanding, especially when interaction must occur in real time. We present a unified framework for real-time, bidirectional haptic interaction with rigid bodies, deformable objects, and Lagrangian fluids in virtual reality (VR). Our approach integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with two-way force coupling and feedback smoothing to maintain stability and produce physically meaningful tactile responses. This enables users to manipulate objects immersed in fluid and feel reaction forces consistent with fluid-structure behavior. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through interactive VR scenarios involving fluid stirring, soft tissue manipulation, and rigid-body interaction. The proposed system advances haptic-enabled multiphysics simulation by unifying fluid, soft-body, and rigid-body dynamics into a single platform suitable for immersive educational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决设计师在合成图像后无法进行图层级编辑的问题，现有方法在可控性和分割精度方面存在局限。

Method: 使用LayerDecompose-DiT模块解耦图像元素到不同图层并实现细粒度控制，通过Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter注入目标图像信息到多层token实现精确条件生成。

Result: 实验结果表明CLD在分解质量和可控性方面持续优于现有方法，分离的图层可直接在PowerPoint等设计工具中操作。

Conclusion: CLD方法具有实际价值和适用性，能够满足现实创意工作流程的需求。

Abstract: This work presents Controllable Layer Decomposition (CLD), a method for achieving fine-grained and controllable multi-layer separation of raster images. In practical workflows, designers typically generate and edit each RGBA layer independently before compositing them into a final raster image. However, this process is irreversible: once composited, layer-level editing is no longer possible. Existing methods commonly rely on image matting and inpainting, but remain limited in controllability and segmentation precision. To address these challenges, we propose two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT), which decouples image elements into distinct layers and enables fine-grained control; and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA), which injects target image information into multi-layer tokens to achieve precise conditional generation. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, we build a new benchmark and introduce tailored evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in both decomposition quality and controllability. Furthermore, the separated layers produced by CLD can be directly manipulated in commonly used design tools such as PowerPoint, highlighting its practical value and applicability in real-world creative workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展受限于基础模型的有限上下文长度，远小于训练时消耗的token数量，需要探索多维度扩展方法。

Method: 提出3D测试时扩展框架，包括上下文长度扩展、批处理扩展（并行采样）和轮次扩展（迭代自优化），并在IOI、IMO和CPHO等测试集上验证。

Result: 每个维度都表现出测试时扩展效应但容量有限，三个维度结合显著提升推理性能，并能从人类偏好反馈中获益。

Conclusion: 3D测试时扩展框架有效提升推理能力，并可扩展到具身学习等开放领域，实现人形控制行为设计。

Abstract: Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) has recently revealed a new scaling effect: test-time scaling. Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.

Abstract: Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件设计验证是最耗时和资源密集的阶段，生成有效的测试激励既关键又劳动密集，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用CD-DPO方法微调LLM，结合PairaNet数据集（包含基于覆盖率指标标注的高质量和低质量测试平台对），将定量覆盖率反馈直接集成到优化目标中。

Result: 在CVDP CID12基准测试中，TB or not TB优于开源和商业基线，代码覆盖率提升高达77.27%。

Conclusion: 覆盖率驱动的偏好优化对于基于LLM的硬件验证非常有效，能够生成最大化验证覆盖率的激励。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in applying them to hardware design and verification. Among these stages, design verification remains the most time-consuming and resource-intensive phase, where generating effective stimuli for the design under test (DUT) is both critical and labor-intensive. We present {\it TB or not TB}, a framework for automated stimulus generation using LLMs fine-tuned through Coverage-Driven Direct Preference Optimization (CD-DPO). To enable preference-based training, we introduce PairaNet, a dataset derived from PyraNet that pairs high- and low-quality testbenches labeled using simulation-derived coverage metrics. The proposed CD-DPO method integrates quantitative coverage feedback directly into the optimization objective, guiding the model toward generating stimuli that maximize verification coverage. Experiments on the CVDP CID12 benchmark show that {\it TB or not TB} outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines, achieving up to 77.27\% improvement in code coverage, demonstrating the effectiveness of Coverage-driven preference optimization for LLM-based hardware verification.

TL;DR: TopoReformer是一个模型无关的文本图像重构管道，利用拓扑特征来减轻对抗性扰动，同时保持文本图像的结构完整性，提高OCR系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性扰动图像可能导致OCR系统产生误导性转录，现有防御方法存在模型特定、计算昂贵、影响正常输入性能等问题，需要更有效的防御方案。

Method: 利用拓扑学特征，通过拓扑自编码器在潜在空间中强制流形一致性，无需显式梯度正则化即可提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在EMNIST、MNIST数据集上针对多种对抗攻击（FGSM、PGD、Carlini-Wagner等）和OCR特定水印攻击（FAWA）进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: TopoReformer提供了一种有效的模型无关防御方法，能够减轻对抗性扰动同时保持文本结构完整性。

Abstract: Adversarially perturbed images of text can cause sophisticated OCR systems to produce misleading or incorrect transcriptions from seemingly invisible changes to humans. Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了新的低噪声条件——模型边界噪声(MM noise)假设，该条件比Tsybakov噪声条件更弱，并在该条件下推导了增强的H-一致性边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Tsybakov噪声条件可能过于严格，需要更弱的噪声假设来获得更好的理论保证。MM噪声条件依赖于假设与贝叶斯分类器之间的差异，而非分布的内在最小边界。

Method: 引入模型边界噪声(MM noise)假设，推导二元和多类分类的增强H-一致性边界，并将其应用于常见的替代损失函数族。

Result: 在比Tsybakov噪声条件更弱的MM噪声假设下，获得了与Mao等人相同的有利指数但更优的增强H-一致性边界，在中间噪声水平下平滑插值于线性和平方根机制之间。

Conclusion: MM噪声条件为分类问题提供了更弱的噪声假设，在此条件下获得了改进的理论保证，扩展了现有H-一致性边界的结果。

Abstract: We introduce a new low-noise condition for classification, the Model Margin Noise (MM noise) assumption, and derive enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds under this condition. MM noise is weaker than Tsybakov noise condition: it is implied by Tsybakov noise condition but can hold even when Tsybakov fails, because it depends on the discrepancy between a given hypothesis and the Bayes-classifier rather than on the intrinsic distributional minimal margin (see Figure 1 for an illustration of an explicit example). This hypothesis-dependent assumption yields enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds for both binary and multi-class classification. Our results extend the enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds of Mao, Mohri, and Zhong (2025a) with the same favorable exponents but under a weaker assumption than the Tsybakov noise condition; they interpolate smoothly between linear and square-root regimes for intermediate noise levels. We also instantiate these bounds for common surrogate loss families and provide illustrative tables.

TL;DR: AFOCP通过特征空间校准和注意力机制改进在线保形预测，在保持覆盖率的同时显著减小预测区间大小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线保形预测存在两个主要限制：在输出空间使用简单的不符合性分数，以及统一处理所有历史观测值进行分位数估计

Method: AFOCP在预训练神经网络的特征空间操作，利用学习到的表示构建更紧凑的预测集；同时引入注意力机制自适应加权历史观测值

Result: AFOCP在保持目标覆盖率的同时，相比标准OCP将预测区间大小减少了多达88%

Conclusion: AFOCP通过特征空间校准和基于注意力的自适应加权，有效解决了标准OCP的局限性，在非平稳和分布偏移情况下提供更紧凑的预测集

Abstract: Online conformal prediction (OCP) wraps around any pre-trained predictor to produce prediction sets with coverage guarantees that hold irrespective of temporal dependencies or distribution shifts. However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法虽然预测性能高，但缺乏透明性和鲁棒性，限制了临床采用。需要开发可解释且可靠的ICU死亡风险预测系统。

Method: 使用逻辑回归模型融合两种模态特定模型的预测：双向LSTM处理生命体征时间序列数据，微调的ClinicalModernBERT处理临床笔记。采用可追溯的架构实现多级可解释性。

Result: 在MIMIC-III基准测试中，晚融合集成方法相比最佳单模型提高了区分度（AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526；AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876），同时保持良好校准的预测。系统在模态缺失时仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持竞争力的同时，提供了可靠、可审计的风险估计和透明、可预测的操作，这对临床应用至关重要。

Abstract: Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use.

Conclusion: 严格的物理和领域启发式归纳偏置可以在工业CAE的基于ML的PDE代理模型中实现准确性、泛化性和实用性的大幅提升。

Abstract: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.

Motivation: 现有的多草稿推测采样方法在寻找最优传输解时面临计算复杂度高的问题，因为需要解决超过V^n个变量的线性规划问题，这在实践中不可行。

Method: 将最优传输线性规划问题重新表述为最大流问题，应用多面体理论将其简化为最多V个变量的凸优化问题，设计出可调精度的算法。

Result: 实现了90%的接受率和低于100ms的每token开销，且与目标模型分布的偏差可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了高效的多草稿推测采样，显著提升了自回归解码的效率。

Abstract: Speculative sampling reduces the latency of autoregressive decoding for target model LLMs without sacrificing inference quality, by using a cheap draft model to suggest a candidate token and a verification criterion to accept or resample this token. To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.

Conclusion: FuncBind提供了一个模态无关的统一框架，能够处理从大到小的分子系统，并引入了新的大环肽生成数据集和基准。

Abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design are often limited to a specific modality, restricting their broader applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcbind.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.

Abstract: Tabular data underpins decisions across science, industry, and public services. Despite rapid progress, advances in deep learning have not fully carried over to the tabular domain, where gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) remain a default choice in practice. We present iLTM, an integrated Large Tabular Model that unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and retrieval within a single architecture. Pretrained on more than 1,800 heterogeneous classification datasets, iLTM achieves consistently superior performance across tabular classification and regression tasks, from small datasets to large and high-dimensional tasks. After light fine-tuning, the meta-trained hypernetwork transfers to regression targets, matching or surpassing strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that iLTM outperforms well-tuned GBDTs and leading deep tabular models while requiring less task-specific tuning. By bridging the gap between tree-based and neural methods, iLTM offers a new framework for tabular foundation models for robust, adaptable, and scalable tabular learning.

Conclusion: 统一的光谱潜在空间可以有效利用更大、更多样化的MIR数据集，预测当前NIR库中代表性不足的土壤属性，为便携式NIR扫描仪提供了增强的预测能力。

Abstract: We propose a self-supervised machine learning (SSML) framework for multi-fidelity learning and extended predictive soil spectroscopy based on latent space embeddings. A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.

Conclusion: 基于代理的SEIRV模型结合机器学习算法能够有效预测无线传感器网络中的流行病传播，为网络安全威胁建模提供了可行方法。

Abstract: The lack of epidemiological data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a fundamental difficulty in constructing robust models to forecast and mitigate threats such as viruses and worms. Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data. Based on the recorded performances, support vector, linear, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regression were among the worst-performing algorithms, while Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors achieved the best results.

TL;DR: 该论文证明了随机R2D和D2D机器遗忘算法在强凸、凸和非凸损失函数下的(ε,δ)认证遗忘保证，通过分析扰动梯度系统并采用最优耦合技术实现概率敏感性界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器遗忘算法旨在无需从头重新训练就能从模型中移除选定训练数据的影响，但现有的随机D2D算法缺乏理论支持，需要为随机版本的R2D和D2D提供理论保证。

Method: 通过分析扰动或有偏梯度系统（收缩、半收缩或扩张），使用最优耦合技术分析遗忘和重新训练轨迹的随机行为，结合新型松弛高斯机制实现(ε,δ)遗忘。

Result: 证明了随机R2D和D2D在强凸、凸和非凸损失函数下都能实现(ε,δ)认证遗忘保证，其中D2D在强凸函数上有更紧的保证，而R2D在凸和非凸设置中也能实现遗忘。

Conclusion: R2D和D2D都是有效的机器遗忘算法，D2D在强凸函数上表现更优，而R2D在更一般的凸和非凸设置中具有可行性，通过逆转累积扰动使遗忘模型更接近重新训练模型。

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(ε, δ)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(ε, δ)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合子治疗组对齐(SGA)和随机时间掩码(RTM)的新框架，用于从时间序列观测中估计反事实结果，解决了反事实轨迹不可观测和时间相关混杂因素的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从时间序列观测中估计反事实结果对于决策制定至关重要，但面临两个主要挑战：反事实轨迹从未被观测到，以及混杂因素随时间演变并在每一步扭曲估计。

Method: SGA通过迭代治疗无关聚类识别细粒度子治疗组，实现更好的分布匹配；RTM通过在训练期间随机用高斯噪声替换输入协变量，促进时间泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，单独应用SGA和RTM都能改进反事实结果估计，但它们的协同组合始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SGA和RTM具有不同但互补的作用：RTM增强时间泛化和跨时间步的鲁棒性，而SGA改进每个特定时间点的去混杂效果。

Abstract: Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.

Abstract: High-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a cornerstone of sustainable urbanism but remains critically hindered by the spatial sparsity of ground monitoring networks. While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas. This work provides a robust, low-cost, and all-weather solution for fine-grained environmental management.

Conclusion: CARE框架成功提升了LLMs的因果推理能力，证明了结合传统算法输出与LLMs知识的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.

Conclusion: HGCN2SP模型有效解决了传统方法在场景选择和顺序优化方面的不足，为两阶段随机规划问题提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.

Conclusion: Agent0通过迭代过程建立自我强化循环，持续产生高质量课程，实现完全自主的代理进化。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, often trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), are constrained by a dependency on human-curated data, limiting scalability and tethering AI to human knowledge. Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 结构化剪枝的有效性取决于重要性在表示空间中的分布方式。基变换剪枝通过正交线性变换将重要性集中在某些维度上，但标准深度学习架构对此类变换不具有内在不变性。

Method: 引入TSRA激活函数家族，该函数在其两个激活子空间内对正交线性变换具有不变性，使得基变换能够合并到周围权重中而不增加参数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上的VGG-16实验中，CoB+TSRA框架在固定比例结构化剪枝下，相比TSRA基线在所有剪枝比例下都提高了精度，并将可靠剪枝前沿从约30%扩展到70%参数而不需要剪枝后微调。在基于阈值的剪枝策略下，能够剪除90-96%参数，同时微调后仅产生1-6%的精度下降。

Conclusion: 旋转不变架构可能为基变换剪枝提供有前景的路径，尽管当前实现相比ReLU基线有4.52%的精度下降，但结果令人鼓舞。

Abstract: Structured pruning removes entire neurons or channels, but its effectiveness depends on how importance is distributed across the representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\%$ to $70\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GESC模型，通过投影干扰机制和相位感知门控解决异配图上的自增强和相位不一致问题，在多种图基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在异配图上表现不佳，主要由于自增强和相位不一致的信号问题。现有方法在相位处理上有限，主要依赖标量加权。

Method: 使用U(1)相位连接和秩1投影，在注意力前衰减自平行分量；引入符号和相位感知门控来调节邻居影响，抑制与当前节点状态对齐的分量。

Result: 在多种图基准测试中，该方法持续优于最新的最先进模型。

Conclusion: GESC提供了一种统一的、干扰感知的消息传递视角，有效解决了异配图上的性能问题。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on homophilous graphs but often fail under heterophily due to self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals. We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing.

TL;DR: ILoRA解决了联邦学习中LoRA面临的三个关键挑战：初始化不稳定性、秩不兼容聚合误差和非IID数据下的客户端漂移，通过QR正交初始化、串联QR聚合和AdamW优化器实现更好的准确性和收敛稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的LoRA方法面临客户端异构性带来的三个关键问题：随机初始化导致的不稳定性、不同秩参数聚合时的偏差，以及非IID数据加剧的客户端漂移，这些问题影响了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出ILoRA框架，包含三个核心创新：QR正交初始化确保客户端在一致子空间开始；串联QR聚合机制通过串联和分解融合异构秩更新；AdamW优化器结合秩感知控制变量来修正本地更新。

Result: 在视觉和NLP基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ILoRA相比现有联邦LoRA方法，在准确性和收敛稳定性方面始终表现更优。

Conclusion: ILoRA通过统一的框架有效解决了联邦LoRA中的关键挑战，提供了理论收敛保证，并在实践中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) faces three critical challenges under client heterogeneity: (1) Initialization-Induced Instability due to random initialization misaligning client subspaces; (2) Rank Incompatibility and Aggregation Error when averaging LoRA parameters of different ranks, which biases the global model; and (3) exacerbated Client Drift under Non-IID Data, impairing generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift. Supported by theoretical convergence guarantees, extensive experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that ILoRA consistently achieves superior accuracy and convergence stability compared to existing federated LoRA methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小语言模型的两步微调方法，通过监督微调和GRPO强化学习优化简历评估模型，解决了传统ATS系统的关键词匹配局限性和RL训练中的奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ATS系统过于依赖关键词匹配，容易因微小语义差异拒绝优秀候选人。需要开发更精细的简历评估模型来克服这一局限性。

Method: 采用两步微调方法：首先进行监督微调建立基线模型，然后使用GRPO强化学习结合多组件奖励函数进行优化，通过反复调整奖励函数和训练超参数解决奖励黑客问题。

Result: 最终模型在未见测试数据上达到91%准确率，对'SELECTED'类别的召回率为0.85，精确度为1.0，显示出优秀的候选识别能力和可靠性。

Conclusion: 经过精心执行的两步微调程序可以有效优化小语言模型，使其能够进行精细且人性化的候选人评分，克服传统ATS和朴素RL使用的缺点。

Abstract: Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable "gentle polishing process" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应正交多项式滤波器(AOPF)来解决谱GNN的异质性和过平滑问题，介绍了L-JacobiNet和S-JacobiNet两种模型，发现[0,∞)域更适合处理异质性，而[-1,1]域在数值稳定性方面更优，并证明ChebyNet的主要问题是稳定性而非静态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统谱GNN如ChebyNet由于使用静态低通滤波器设计，受到异质性和过平滑问题的限制，需要研究自适应正交多项式滤波器作为解决方案。

Method: 提出了两种在[-1,1]域操作的模型：1) L-JacobiNet - ChebyNet的自适应推广，具有可学习的alpha、beta形状参数；2) S-JacobiNet - 使用LayerNorm稳定的静态ChebyNet基线模型。

Result: 研究发现[0,∞)域在建模异质性方面更优，而[-1,1]域在高K值(K>20)时提供更好的数值稳定性。静态S-JacobiNet在5个基准数据集中的4个上优于自适应L-JacobiNet。

Conclusion: ChebyNet的主要缺陷是稳定性问题而非静态特性，S-JacobiNet是一个被忽视的强大基线模型，在[-1,1]域的自适应可能导致过拟合。

Abstract: Spectral GNNs, like ChebyNet, are limited by heterophily and over-smoothing due to their static, low-pass filter design. This work investigates the "Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现中机器学习模型的性能高度依赖于训练数据的质量和一致性。由于数据集规模限制，模型通常从多个来源聚合生物活性数据，但这会引入实验协议变异性带来的显著噪声。

Method: AssayMatch利用数据归因方法量化每个训练实验对模型性能的贡献，使用这些归因分数微调基于文本的实验描述的语言嵌入，不仅捕捉语义相似性，还捕捉实验间的兼容性。

Result: 使用AssayMatch选择数据训练的模型能够超越在完整数据集上训练的模型性能，在9/12的模型-目标对中表现出比仅使用语言的基线更强的预测能力。

Conclusion: AssayMatch提供了一种数据驱动机制来策划更高质量的数据集，减少不兼容实验的噪声，提高药物发现模型的预测能力和数据效率。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models in drug discovery is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the underlying training data. Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery.

Conclusion: 该方法通过灵活偏差控制和增强表示学习，有效提升了连续控制任务的性能，展示了双演员-评论家框架的潜力。

Abstract: Deterministic policy gradient algorithms for continuous control suffer from value estimation biases that degrade performance. While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HybSpecNet，一种混合域图神经网络，通过结合稳定的ChebyNet分支和自适应的KrawtchoukNet分支来解决谱图神经网络中的"稳定性vs适应性"权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谱图神经网络面临"稳定性vs适应性"的基本权衡：有限域[-1,1]的滤波器（如ChebyNet）数值稳定但适应性差，在半无限域[0,∞)的滤波器（如KrawtchoukNet）自适应性强但数值不稳定。需要设计一种能同时保持稳定性和适应性的架构。

Method: 提出HybSpecNet混合架构：1）初始采用简单拼接融合的"naive"混合架构；2）发现该架构存在"不稳定性毒化"问题；3）提出使用"Late Fusion"的先进架构，完全隔离梯度路径以解决不稳定性问题。

Result: 实验表明：1）naive架构在低K时性能良好，但在K=25时发生灾难性崩溃；2）Late Fusion架构在K=30时仍保持完美稳定，同时在所有图类型上保持SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 本文识别了混合GNN设计中的关键架构陷阱，并提供了稳健的架构解决方案，成功解决了谱图神经网络中的稳定性-适应性权衡问题。

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental "Stability-vs-Adaptivity" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a "naive" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as "Instability Poisoning," where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses "Late Fusion" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.

Abstract: Trajectory generation has recently drawn growing interest in privacy-preserving urban mobility studies and location-based service applications. Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.
  Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\%$ and $26.3\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising. Lastly, the framework design offers a significant efficiency advantage, saving $64.8\%$ of the time and $56.5\%$ of GPU memory compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from social media is critical for understanding public sentiment, but accessing training data has become prohibitively expensive due to escalating API costs and platform restrictions. We introduce an interpretability-guided framework where Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide principled guidance for LLM-based synthetic data generation. With sufficient seed data, SHAP-guided approach matches real data performance, significantly outperforms naïve generation, and substantially improves classification for underrepresented emotion classes. However, our linguistic analysis reveals that synthetic text exhibits reduced vocabulary richness and fewer personal or temporally complex expressions than authentic posts. This work provides both a practical framework for responsible synthetic data generation and a critical perspective on its limitations, underscoring that the future of trustworthy AI depends on navigating the trade-offs between synthetic utility and real-world authenticity.

Motivation: 当前TSAD研究主要关注无监督方法，依赖复杂架构建模正常数据分布，但忽视了实际场景中有限异常标签可带来的显著性能提升。

Method: 进行了监督与无监督范式的首次系统比较，并引入STAND——一个简化的监督基线模型。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上的实验表明：(1)标签比模型更重要；(2)监督带来更高回报；(3)STAND在预测一致性和异常定位方面优于无监督方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果主张TSAD研究应向以数据为中心转变，强调标签利用而非纯粹算法复杂性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

In this work, we aim to improve MPC methods through data-driven simulation schemes. Thus, from a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), this paper introduces two surrogate models acting as alternative simulation schemes to enhance nuclear reactor core simulation. We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).

Abstract: Accurate and reliable wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, balancing supply and demand, and market risk management. Even though short-term weather forecasts have been thoroughly used to provide short-term renewable power predictions, forecasts involving longer prediction horizons still need investigations. Despite the recent progress in subseasonal-to-seasonal weather probabilistic forecasting, their use for wind power prediction usually involves both temporal and spatial aggregation achieve reasonable skill. In this study, we present a forecasting pipeline enabling to transform ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power forecasts for lead times ranging from 1 day to 46 days at daily resolution. This framework also include post-processing of the resulting power ensembles to account for the biases and lack of dispersion of the weather forecasts. We show that our method is able to outperform a climatological baseline by 50 % in terms of both Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score and Ensemble Mean Squared Error while also providing near perfect calibration of the forecasts for lead times ranging from 15 to 46 days.

Abstract: Rumor detection on social media remains a challenging task due to the complex propagation dynamics and the limited interpretability of existing models. While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics. Our framework provides a unified approach for rumor classification and influence analysis, paving the way for more explainable and actionable misinformation detection systems.

*Antonios Antoniadis,Ali Shahheidar,Golnoosh Shahkarami,Abolfazl Soltani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了SemiTrust-and-Switch框架，用于结合预测和经典算法的在线区间调度问题，在保证鲁棒性的同时利用预测提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线区间调度需要在区间到达时立即决定接受或拒绝，目标是最大化接受区间的总长度且不重叠。在机器学习预测可用的情况下，如何设计既能利用预测提升性能，又能在预测错误时保持鲁棒性的算法。

Method: 提出了SemiTrust-and-Switch统一框架，结合预测算法和经典算法，适用于确定性和随机算法。还设计了随机算法，在预测算法和鲁棒算法之间平滑插值。

Result: 该框架在特定设置下被证明是紧的（通过下界证明）。随机算法实现了鲁棒性和平滑性，性能随预测质量优雅下降。

Conclusion: SemiTrust-and-Switch框架为学习增强的在线区间调度提供了统一方法，平衡了预测准确时的性能和对抗性输入下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We study online interval scheduling in the irrevocable setting, where each interval must be immediately accepted or rejected upon arrival. The objective is to maximize the total length of accepted intervals while ensuring that no two accepted intervals overlap. We consider this problem in a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to (machine-learned) predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that leverage these predictions to improve performance while maintaining robust guarantees in the presence of prediction errors.
  Our main contribution is the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework, which provides a unified approach for combining prediction-based and classical interval scheduling algorithms. This framework applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms and captures the trade-off between consistency (performance under accurate predictions) and robustness (performance under adversarial inputs). Moreover, we provide lower bounds, proving the tightness of this framework in particular settings.
  We further design a randomized algorithm that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust algorithms. This algorithm achieves both robustness and smoothness--its performance degrades gracefully with the quality of the prediction.

Abstract: The importance of Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) has increased significantly in domains where data quality is poor or access is limited due to privacy and regulatory constraints. One such domain is recruitment, where publicly available datasets are scarce due to the sensitive nature of information typically found in curricula vitae, such as gender, disability status, or age. %
This lack of accessible, representative data presents a significant obstacle to the development of fair and transparent machine learning models, particularly ranking algorithms that require large volumes of data to effectively learn how to recommend candidates. In the absence of such data, these models are prone to poor generalisation and may fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios. %
Recent advances in Causal Generative Models (CGMs) offer a promising solution. CGMs enable the generation of synthetic datasets that preserve the underlying causal relationships within the data, providing greater control over fairness and interpretability in the data generation process. %
In this study, we present a specialised SDG method involving two CGMs: one modelling job offers and the other modelling curricula. Each model is structured according to a causal graph informed by domain expertise. We use these models to generate synthetic datasets and evaluate the fairness of candidate rankings under controlled scenarios that introduce specific biases.

Abstract: Deep generative modeling provides a powerful pathway to overcome data scarcity in energy-related applications where experimental data are often limited, costly, or difficult to obtain. By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA)方法，通过在少样本学习中模拟目标域未知的标签分布偏斜，解决农业作物分类中类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实农业数据通常呈现长尾分布，存在严重的类别不平衡问题。现有方法构建的训练集往往是人工平衡的，与真实测试分布不匹配，导致泛化性能下降。

Method: 将真实世界分布建模为Dirichlet分布的随机变量，在少样本学习过程中执行先验增强，动态调整决策边界。

Result: 实验表明DirPA成功调整了决策边界，通过作为动态特征正则器稳定了训练过程。

Conclusion: DirPA方法能够有效处理农业作物分类中的类别不平衡问题，提升模型在真实世界条件下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-world agricultural distributions often suffer from severe class imbalance, typically following a long-tailed distribution. Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应时间窗口整合的神经启发式非阻塞推理范式，能够动态适应异构数据流的随机延迟模式，无需依赖参考模态，在通信延迟感知下实现鲁棒的实时推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非阻塞推理方法依赖参考模态范式，需要等待一个模态完全接收后才能处理，且依赖昂贵的离线分析，无法有效应对多数据流中不确定的通信延迟对推理过程时序流的影响。

Result: 在音视频事件定位任务上的实验表明，相比现有方法，该框架对网络动态具有更优越的适应性。

Conclusion: 提出的神经启发式非阻塞推理范式通过自适应时间窗口整合，实现了对精度-延迟权衡的更细粒度控制，在动态网络环境下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Connected cyber-physical systems perform inference based on real-time inputs from multiple data streams. Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Experiments on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task demonstrate superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to SotA approaches.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法成功将连续过松弛技术扩展到高维双玩家零和博弈中，提供了更快的收敛速度和更好的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of a two-player zero-sum game. In the literature, the successive over-relaxation Q-learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, and it is seen to result in a lower contraction factor for the associated Q-Bellman operator resulting in a faster value iteration-based procedure. However, this has been presented only for the tabular case and not for the setting with function approximation that typically caters to real-world high-dimensional state-action spaces. Furthermore, such settings in the case of two-player zero-sum games have not been considered. We thus propose a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm that incorporates deep neural networks as function approximators and is suitable for high-dimensional spaces. We prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing Q-learning algorithm. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effect of different values of the crucial successive over-relaxation parameter.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了pass@k指标作为强化学习优化目标的局限性，指出它本质上是对pass@1的正向重加权，在需要探索的关键阶段提供消失的学习信号，可能导致探索崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和增强大语言模型的复杂多步推理能力是现代AI研究的核心，pass@k指标因其直观性被广泛采用为评估标准和优化目标，但其作为直接优化目标的有效性需要深入分析。

Method: 分析pass@k目标函数，推导其梯度，证明其本质上是pass@1目标的逐样本正向重加权，并分析探索崩溃的动态过程。

Result: pass@k目标在需要探索的关键阶段提供消失的学习信号，随着策略概率质量集中，pass@k与pass@1之间的差距会缩小，导致探索崩溃。

Conclusion: pass@k作为诊断工具很有用，但不适合作为直接优化目标，应使用明确鼓励高效探索的机制来推进推理任务的强化学习。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, multi-step reasoning is a central focus of modern AI research. To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of "exploration collapse", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 轻量级、原型中心的方法提供了实用且强大的替代方案，实现了优异的检索性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Trajectory similarity retrieval is an important part of spatiotemporal data mining, however, existing methods have the following limitations: traditional metrics are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods suffer from substantial training costs and potential instability. This paper addresses these problems by proposing \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{T}rajectory \textbf{H}ashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.

Result: 经验证明该方法能可靠地生成分布内且结构差异最小的反事实，适用于离散分类目标和连续属性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了图数据反事实解释生成的挑战，为图学习模型提供了有效的解释工具。

Abstract: Machine learning models that operate on graph-structured data, such as molecular graphs or social networks, often make accurate predictions but offer little insight into why certain predictions are made. Counterfactual explanations address this challenge by seeking the closest alternative scenario where the model's prediction would change. Although counterfactual explanations are extensively studied in tabular data and computer vision, the graph domain remains comparatively underexplored. Constructing graph counterfactuals is intrinsically difficult because graphs are discrete and non-euclidean objects. We introduce Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation, a novel framework for generating counterfactual explanations on graph data, combining discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance. We empirically demonstrate that our method reliably generates in-distribution as well as minimally structurally different counterfactuals for both discrete classification targets and continuous properties.

Abstract: Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: 现代学习机制可作为传统观测器设计的强大补充，在不确定系统中实现更准确和鲁棒的状态估计

Abstract: This work introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain dynamics. Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems. Codes are available at https://github.com/Hao-B-Shu/LTI_LEO.

Abstract: Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.

Abstract: Scalable Gaussian process (GP) inference is essential for sequential decision-making tasks, yet improving GP scalability remains a challenging problem with many open avenues of research. This paper focuses on iterative GPs, where iterative linear solvers, such as conjugate gradients, stochastic gradient descent or alternative projections, are used to approximate the GP posterior. We propose a new method which improves solver convergence of a large linear system by leveraging the known solution to a smaller system contained within. This is significant for tasks with incremental data additions, and we show that our technique achieves speed-ups when solving to tolerance, as well as improved Bayesian optimisation performance under a fixed compute budget.

Conclusion: 尽管基础模型具有通用性，但在破产预测任务中，当前的基础模型仍然不如专门的机器学习方法有效。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown promise across various financial applications, yet their effectiveness for corporate bankruptcy prediction remains systematically unevaluated against established methods. We study bankruptcy forecasting using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN, evaluated on large, highly imbalanced datasets of over one million company records from the Visegrád Group. We provide the first systematic comparison of foundation models against classical machine learning baselines for this task. Our results show that models such as XGBoost and CatBoost consistently outperform foundation models across all prediction horizons. LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable probability estimates, undermining their use in risk-sensitive financial settings. TabPFN, while competitive with simpler baselines, requires substantial computational resources with costs not justified by performance gains. These findings suggest that, despite their generality, current foundation models remain less effective than specialized methods for bankruptcy forecasting.

Conclusion: LDP机制是一种有原则且有效的预处理公平性干预技术，在保护敏感属性隐私的同时实现了更好的准确性-公平性权衡。

Abstract: We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.

Abstract: Wearable sensor technologies and deep learning are transforming healthcare management. Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.

### [166] [FreqFlow: Long-term forecasting using lightweight flow matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16426)
*Seyed Mohamad Moghadas,Bruno Cornelis,Adrian Munteanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreqFlow是一个在频域中使用条件流匹配进行确定性多变量时间序列预测的新框架，相比基于扩散的模型参数更少、速度更快，在真实交通数据集上平均提升7%的RMSE性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于去噪扩散的生成模型虽然能捕捉复杂数据分布，但存在计算开销大、迭代采样过程慢的问题，限制了实时部署，且在处理高维、非平稳、多尺度周期性模式时表现脆弱。

Method: 将预测问题转换到频域，通过单个复数值线性层学习幅度和相位偏移，使用ODE积分进行单次确定性采样，将MTS信号分解为趋势、季节性和残差分量，流匹配机制专门用于残差学习以提升长期预测精度。

Result: 在真实交通速度、流量和流量数据集上的广泛实验表明，FreqFlow实现了最先进的预测性能，平均RMSE提升7%，同时比现有方法显著更快且参数效率更高（仅89k参数）。

Conclusion: FreqFlow通过频域流匹配提供了一种轻量级、高效的MTS预测解决方案，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了计算复杂度和参数数量。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is fundamental to applications ranging from urban mobility and resource management to climate modeling. While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床时间序列数据具有不规则采样、复杂潜在生理学和测量不确定性的特点，现有方法难以有效处理这些挑战，需要开发能够统一处理这些问题的概率建模框架。

Method: 使用潜在神经随机微分方程建模，将临床时间序列视为潜在随机动力系统的离散观测，通过变分推理进行状态估计和参数学习，包含模态依赖的发射模型。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现精确的、不确定性感知的预测，为临床决策提供支持，展示了在复杂临床时间序列分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.

### [168] [A Comparison Between Decision Transformers and Traditional Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16475)
*Ali Murtaza Caunhye,Asad Jeewa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较决策变换器与传统离线强化学习算法在ANT连续控制环境中密集和稀疏奖励设置下的性能，发现DT对奖励密度变化不敏感且在稀疏奖励场景中表现优异，而基于价值的方法在密集奖励和高质量数据下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线RL算法在平衡探索和利用方面面临挑战，特别是在奖励密度变化的环境中。决策变换器将离线RL重新定义为序列建模问题，已在多个基准测试中显示出优异结果，需要系统比较其与传统方法在不同奖励结构下的表现。

Method: 在ANT连续控制环境中进行实证分析，比较决策变换器与传统离线RL算法（如CQL和IQL）在密集和稀疏奖励设置下的性能，评估它们在不同数据质量下的学习能力和泛化能力。

Result: DT对奖励密度变化不敏感，在稀疏奖励场景中表现优异，特别是使用中等专家数据集时；IQL在密集奖励设置和高质量数据下表现更好；CQL在不同数据质量下提供平衡性能；DT性能方差较低但计算资源需求显著更高。

Conclusion: 序列建模方法更适合奖励结构不确定或数据质量混合的场景，而基于价值的方法在密集奖励和高质量演示的设置中仍具有竞争力。

Abstract: The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了多目标强化学习(MORL)中标量化函数的局限性，发现它们在复杂环境中难以准确逼近帕累托前沿，而内循环多策略算法提供了更稳健的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标量化函数在多目标强化学习算法中被广泛使用，但在复杂不确定环境中往往难以准确逼近帕累托前沿，限制了其决策能力。

Method: 使用外循环多策略方法评估MO Q-Learning算法（采用线性标量化和切比雪夫标量化函数），并探索内循环多策略算法Pareto Q-Learning。

Result: 标量化函数的性能高度依赖环境和帕累托前沿形状，往往无法保留学习过程中发现的解，且偏向在解空间的特定区域寻找解。找到合适的权重配置来采样整个帕累托前沿很复杂。

Conclusion: 内循环多策略算法可能提供更可持续和可泛化的方法，有助于在动态不确定环境中实现智能决策。

Abstract: Scalarisation functions are widely employed in MORL algorithms to enable intelligent decision-making. However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型日益复杂和高风险应用对透明度的需求增加，现有全局归因方法存在计算成本高、在相关输入下缺乏稳定性、难以扩展到大型或异构数据集等问题。

Method: ExCIR通过鲁棒中心化（减去中位数或中均值）后量化特征与模型输出的符号对齐共变，BlockCIR是其分组扩展，将相关特征集作为单个单元评分，避免共线性簇中的重复计算。

Result: 在文本、表格、信号和图像数据集上，ExCIR与现有基准方法和完整模型具有可信的一致性，提供稳定的top-k排名，并通过在数据子集上的轻量级评估减少运行时间。

Conclusion: ExCIR为实际部署提供了计算高效、一致且可扩展的可解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly essential as modern models become more complex and high-stakes applications demand transparency, trust, and regulatory compliance. Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \textsc{BlockCIR}, a \emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows. Overall, ExCIR provides \emph{computationally efficient}, \emph{consistent}, and \emph{scalable} explainability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Designing rewards for autonomous cyber attack and defense learning agents in a complex, dynamic environment is a challenging task for subject matter experts. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.

Conclusion: ODE-ViT提供了一种稳定、可解释且高效的Transformer替代方案

Abstract: In recent years, increasingly large models have achieved outstanding performance across CV tasks. However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.

Motivation: 现有的标签错误检测方法需要能够抵抗标签错误的模型，但在被污染数据上训练这样的模型具有挑战性。受Focal Loss启发，希望通过调整损失函数来改进这一问题。

Method: 提出了两种新颖而简单的损失函数：一种降低困难样本权重，另一种完全忽略这些可能含有标签错误的困难样本。

Result: 在人工污染数据上的实验结果显示，相比传统的分类交叉熵和Focal Loss基准方法，新方法在标签错误检测的F1分数上有所提升。

Conclusion: 通过调整损失函数来专门处理可能含有标签错误的困难样本，可以有效改进标签错误检测的性能。

Abstract: Methods for detecting label errors in training data require models that are robust to label errors (i.e., not fit to erroneously labelled data points). However, acquiring such models often involves training on corrupted data, which presents a challenge. Adjustments to the loss function present an opportunity for improvement. Motivated by Focal Loss (which emphasizes difficult-to-classify samples), two novel, yet simple, loss functions are proposed that de-weight or ignore these difficult samples (i.e., those likely to have label errors). Results on artificially corrupted data show promise, such that F1 scores for detecting errors are improved from the baselines of conventional categorical Cross Entropy and Focal Loss.

Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.

Conclusion: 动态客户端参与对联邦学习性能有重大影响，KPFL方法为解决这一问题提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了模型在动态环境下的表现。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a shared model in a distributed manner, setting it apart from traditional deep learning paradigms. However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant impact of dynamic participation on FL performance and the effectiveness of KPFL in improving model robustness and generalization.

Result: 实验表明该方法优于传统低秩分解方法和最先进的公平性增强技术，同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 这是首个将SVD主要用于公平性增强而非压缩的工作，为深度学习模型公平性提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) techniques become integral to various applications, ensuring model fairness while maintaining high performance has become increasingly critical, particularly in sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis. Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing SVD not primarily for compression but for fairness enhancement.

Abstract: Universal approximation serves as the foundation of neural network learning algorithms. However, some networks establish their universal approximation property by demonstrating that the iterative errors converge in probability measure rather than the more rigorous norm convergence, which makes the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks highly sensitive to random parameter selection, Broad residual learning system (BRLS), as a member of randomized learning models, also encounters this issue. We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence. Three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms are presented to satisfy the application requirements of various network updates. Solar panels dust detection experiments are performed on publicly available dataset and compared with 13 deep and broad learning algorithms. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness and superiority of BSCRLS algorithms.

Abstract: Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.

Abstract: Severe class imbalance is common in real-world tabular learning, where rare but important minority classes are essential for reliable prediction. Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.

*Fares Fourati,Mohamed-Slim Alouini,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECPv2是一种可扩展的全局优化算法，针对Lipschitz连续函数进行优化，解决了ECP算法的高计算成本和保守行为问题，通过自适应下界、Worst-m记忆机制和随机投影等创新，在保持理论保证的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECP算法虽然能确保每次函数评估都有潜在信息价值，但存在计算成本高、早期行为过于保守等关键限制，需要改进以实现更高效的全局优化。

Method: ECPv2引入三个创新：(1)自适应下界避免无效接受区域；(2)Worst-m记忆机制限制与固定大小历史评估子集的比较；(3)固定随机投影加速高维距离计算。

Result: 理论证明ECPv2保持ECP的无悔保证和最优有限时间边界，实验验证在多种高维非凸优化问题上，ECPv2始终匹配或优于最先进优化器，同时显著减少运行时间。

Conclusion: ECPv2成功解决了ECP的关键限制，在保持理论保证的同时实现了更好的性能和效率，为高维全局优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose ECPv2, a scalable and theoretically grounded algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 证明了差分隐私随机梯度下降(DP-SGD)及其动量变体在标准光滑性假设下几乎必然收敛，为差分隐私优化提供了更强的理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对DP-SGD的理论分析通常只建立期望收敛或高概率收敛，未能解决单条轨迹的几乎必然收敛问题，对其长期行为理解有限。

Method: 在标准步长衰减条件下，通过精心构造能量函数，分析了DP-SGD及其动量变体(DP-SHB和DP-NAG)的收敛性。

Result: 证明了DP-SGD在非凸和强凸设置下都几乎必然收敛，表明尽管存在隐私引起的失真，算法在凸和非凸区域都保持路径稳定性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为差分隐私优化提供了更强的理论保证，表明隐私保护算法在路径稳定性方面具有良好性质。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has become the standard algorithm for training machine learning models with rigorous privacy guarantees. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.

Conclusion: 自监督学习方法能够学习到包含触诊对象相关信息的表示，为人工触诊提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.

Result: EGGROLL在保持性能的同时大幅提升效率，在强化学习和语言模型推理任务中表现优异，支持纯整数数据类型的非线性循环语言模型预训练。

Conclusion: EGGROLL成功解决了大规模进化策略优化的计算瓶颈，为大规模神经网络优化提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastrl.

Conclusion: eLLM提供了一个可扩展且可靠的基于分类法的分类解决方案，可能显著减少对人类专家标注的依赖。

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.
  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

Motivation: 当前基于指令的系统在ARC-AGI任务中缺乏对编码方式如何影响模型感知的系统性分析，以及如何区分指令错误和执行错误。

Method: 使用加权集合分歧度量和两阶段推理流程，在九种文本和图像模态中分离感知与推理，测试不同表示方式对模型感知的影响。

Result: 结构化文本在稀疏特征上能提供精确坐标，图像能捕捉2D形状但对分辨率敏感，结合文本和图像可提升约8个感知点和0.20的中位相似度。

Conclusion: 将表示方式与transformer的归纳偏置对齐，并实现文本和图像之间的交叉验证，可以在不改变底层模型的情况下获得更准确的指令和更可靠的执行。

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

Conclusion: ToolMind通过轮次级验证方法缓解了训练中的错误放大问题，同时保留了自我纠正推理信号，为稳健的工具使用学习提供了高质量数据。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

Motivation: LLM越来越多地使用外部网页内容，但这些内容由于格式不友好和上下文长度限制而不易被LLM消化。

Method: CoS方法采用类似黑格尔辩证法的迭代过程：初始摘要（正题）→通过质疑识别局限性（反题）→生成通用摘要（合题），满足当前和未来信息需求。

Result: 在TriviaQA、TruthfulQA和SQUAD数据集上，CoS比零样本LLM基线提升66%，比BRIO和PEGASUS等专业摘要方法提升27%。CoS生成的摘要使用更少token，且与下游LLM无关。

Conclusion: CoS为网站维护者提供了一种使内容更易被LLM访问的吸引人选择，同时保留了人工监督的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务中表现出色，但在专业领域应用中存在知识鸿沟，且在需要多步推理的复杂问题上性能下降。为了提升本科生物力学课程的学习效果，需要开发专门的教育助手。

Method: 构建双模块框架：1) 使用检索增强生成(RAG)提高LLM回答概念性真/假问题的准确性和逻辑一致性；2) 构建多智能体系统(MAS)解决需要多步推理和代码执行的计算问题。

Result: RAG显著提升了LLM在概念性问题上的性能和稳定性，超过了基础模型。MAS展示了在多步推理、方程推导、代码执行和生成可解释解决方案方面的能力。

Conclusion: RAG和MAS技术有潜力增强LLM在工程专业课程中的表现，为开发工程教育智能辅导系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)有望加速生产系统中的事故响应，但单智能体方法生成模糊、不可用的推荐。

Method: 开发了MyAntFarm.ai框架，通过348个对照试验比较单智能体副驾驶与多智能体系统在相同事故场景下的表现。

Result: 多智能体编排实现了100%可操作推荐率，而单智能体方法仅为1.7%；在行动特异性方面改进80倍，解决方案正确性方面改进140倍。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排从性能优化转变为基于LLM的事故响应的生产就绪要求，引入了决策质量(DQ)这一新指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

Conclusion: IMACT-CXR成功整合了多种交互和分析技术，为医学影像解读培训提供了一个有效的智能辅导系统，具有实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making. Code: https://github.com/Skyfall-Research/MAPs

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明激活引导能显著提升语言模型的心智理论能力，但其内部机制尚不明确，需要探究激活引导如何改变模型内部处理过程

Method: 使用线性探针分析45种认知行为，在Gemma-3-4B模型上应用对比激活加法引导，并在1000个BigToM前向信念场景中评估

Result: 信念归因任务准确率从32.5%提升至46.7%，主要机制是情感感知(+2.23)和情感评估(+2.20)增强，同时抑制了质疑(-0.78)和聚合思维(-1.59)

Conclusion: LLM成功的心智理论能力主要由情感理解而非分析推理介导

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

Conclusion: 多智能体SLM系统在判断任务中有潜力匹配或超越LLM性能，为可扩展高效评估提供了新途径。

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

Conclusion: KRAL是增强本地LLMs临床诊断能力的有效解决方案，可在复杂医疗决策支持中实现低成本、高安全性的部署。

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

Result: 在官方Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B睡眠代理模型上达到92.5%准确率，100%精确度（零误报）和85%召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了AI部署中的关键安全漏洞，证明基于嵌入的检测可以有效识别欺骗性模型行为，且不影响部署效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

TL;DR: LLMs在临床环境中即使获得正确证据也未必能正确推理，作者使用WET指南作为测试平台，发现即使提供权威段落错误仍然存在，提出了评估推理准确性、一致性和忠实度的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床环境中，LLMs的检索与推理之间存在差距，即使获得正确证据，输出也可能不符合结构化协议，这存在安全隐患。

Method: 使用Written Exposure Therapy (WET)指南作为测试平台，评估模型对经过临床医生审核的问题的响应，提出评估推理准确性、一致性和忠实度的框架。

Result: 即使提供权威段落，错误仍然存在；检索增强生成(RAG)可以约束输出，但安全部署需要像严格评估检索一样严格评估推理。

Conclusion: 在临床环境中部署LLMs时，需要同等严格地评估推理过程和检索质量，以确保输出符合结构化协议和安全要求。

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Conclusion: 该项目提出了人-机-生态系统的新范式，证明了AI代理在促进对环境数据的情感化、直观化访问方面的潜力。

Abstract: Sensorium Arc (AI reflects on climate) is a real-time multimodal interactive AI agent system that personifies the ocean as a poetic speaker and guides users through immersive explorations of complex marine data. Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.

Abstract: Digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector has produced vast yet fragmented collections of artefact data. Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form. We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.

Motivation: 现有的约束规划模型依赖预定义的虚拟批次集合，这会导致维度灾难并增加问题复杂性。在半导体制造等实际应用中，最小批次大小是常见要求，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用关键对齐参数直接对机器上相同族作业的序列进行推理，构建紧凑的约束规划模型。通过定制搜索阶段和增强约束传播器的推理级别来改进模型。

Result: 在近5000个实例上的计算实验表明，所提模型在最多100个作业的小到中型实例上表现优越，在最多500个作业、10个族、10台机器的大规模实例上，能够找到比现有方法好25%的解决方案。

Conclusion: 新的约束规划模型通过消除对虚拟批次集合的依赖，提供了更紧凑和高效的解决方案，在串行批处理调度问题上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

Motivation: 开发一个高效的智能体训练框架，解决多轮长视野任务中的训练效率问题，并通过强化学习训练专门的软件工程智能体。

Method: 使用优化的异步流水线调度器（1.55倍加速）和基于AST的搜索工具增强训练配方，提升代码导航能力和训练效率。

Result: SA-SWE-32B在SWE-Bench Verified上达到39.4% Pass@1，相比之前模型成本降低2倍以上，并能有效泛化到其他智能体任务。

Conclusion: SkyRL-Agent框架通过高效调度和工具集成，成功训练出高性能软件工程智能体，证明了其在多领域智能体训练中的可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

TL;DR: 提出了MR-RML框架，通过GPRC技术解决LLM在医疗领域应用的三个关键对齐挑战，在权威医疗基准Healthbench上显著提升性能，达到开源LLM的SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在医疗实践中面临的关键对齐挑战：静态评估与动态临床认知需求脱节、难以适应多源医疗标准、传统奖励模型无法捕捉多维医疗质量标准。

Method: 提出MR-RML框架，包含三个核心创新：1）"维度-场景-学科"医疗标准系统；2）独立多维奖励模型；3）几何投影参考约束将医疗认知逻辑转化为数学正则化。

Result: 在Healthbench基准上，相比基础模型Qwen-32B，全子集性能提升45%，困难子集提升85%，达到开源LLM的SOTA水平（全子集62.7，困难子集44.7），超越多数闭源模型。

Conclusion: MR-RML框架通过结构化整合医疗标准、多维奖励建模和几何约束，有效解决了LLM在医疗领域的对齐问题，显著提升了临床实用性。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前足球视频理解方法在构建可靠的回放数据方面仍不足，通常只能辅助而非完全自动化标注。同时战术建模、轨迹预测等研究需要基于游戏状态和回放数据，这促使利用战术知识作为先验来支持基于计算机视觉的预测。

Method: 引入FOOTPASS数据集，支持开发利用计算机视觉任务输出（如跟踪、识别）和足球战术知识（包括长期战术规律）的球员中心动作识别方法。

Result: 创建了首个覆盖整个足球比赛的多模态、多智能体战术背景下的回放动作识别基准数据集。

Conclusion: FOOTPASS数据集为数据驱动的体育分析提供了重要的输入源，能够生成可靠的回放数据流，支持更自动化的足球视频理解。

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的自动化算法设计主要关注性能提升但缺乏可解释性，无法揭示算法为何有效、哪些组件重要或设计选择与问题结构的关系。

Method: 构建三支柱框架：(i) LLM驱动的算法变体发现；(ii) 可解释基准测试，将性能归因于组件和超参数；(iii) 问题类别描述符，连接算法行为与景观结构。

Result: 这些元素形成闭环知识循环，其中发现、解释和泛化相互加强，实现从盲目搜索到可解释算法设计的转变。

Conclusion: 这种集成将加速进展，同时为优化策略何时及为何成功产生可重用的科学见解，推动领域向可解释、类别特定的算法设计发展。

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

Motivation: 传统奖励模型难以同时优化多个可能冲突的偏好维度（如事实性、帮助性、安全性），且评分透明度有限。

Method: 将偏好评估分解为领域特定的智能体，每个产生部分信号，结合全局评估器。中央聚合器融合这些信号，平衡逐步正确性、多智能体一致性和重复惩罚。

Result: CRM和rewardBench提供了更透明的奖励建模和更稳定优化的实用模块化路径。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作奖励模型框架能够在不增加额外人工标注的情况下，实现多视角奖励塑造，提高RLHF的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

### [222] [Revisiting Fairness-aware Interactive Recommendation: Item Lifecycle as a Control Knob](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16248)
*Yun Lu,Xiaoyu Shi,Hong Xie,Chongjun Xia,Zhenhui Gong,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入物品生命周期作为新的控制维度，提出了LHRL框架来平衡推荐系统的公平性和准确性。该框架包含相位检测器和分层强化学习代理，实验证明能同时提升公平性和用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视公平感知的交互式推荐系统，发现短视频平台中物品生命周期呈现压缩的三阶段模式（快速增长、短暂稳定、急剧衰减），与传统四阶段模型不同，这为平衡公平性和准确性提供了新的机会。

Method: 提出LHRL（生命周期感知分层强化学习）框架：1) PhaseFormer - 结合STL分解和注意力机制的轻量级相位检测器；2) 两级HRL代理 - 高层策略施加相位感知的公平约束，低层策略优化即时用户参与度，实现长期公平与短期效用的解耦优化。

Result: 在多个真实世界交互推荐数据集上的实验表明，LHRL显著提升了公平性和用户参与度。将生命周期感知奖励集成到现有RL模型中也能持续带来性能提升。

Conclusion: 物品生命周期是平衡推荐系统公平性和准确性的有效控制维度，LHRL框架具有通用性和实用价值，为公平感知推荐提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

### [223] [MuISQA: Multi-Intent Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Scientific Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16283)
*Zhiyuan Li,Haisheng Yu,Guangchuan Guo,Nan Zhou,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA)基准，评估RAG系统在多意图科学问答中的异构证据覆盖能力，并提出基于LLM的意图感知检索框架来提升多意图问题的证据覆盖和检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统通常针对单一意图设计，无法有效处理包含多个子意图的复杂科学问题，导致证据覆盖不完整。

Method: 使用LLM假设潜在答案，将问题分解为意图特定的查询，为每个意图检索支持段落，然后通过互惠排名融合(RRF)聚合和重排序检索结果。

Result: 在MuISQA基准和其他通用RAG数据集上的实验表明，该方法在检索准确性和证据覆盖方面持续优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 意图感知检索框架能够有效提升多意图科学问题的证据覆盖，为复杂科学问答提供更全面的支持。

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

*Daniel Vaughan,Kateřina Vaughan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 展示跨分布式系统的代理间通信概念验证，仅使用自然语言消息，无需共享标识符、结构化模式或集中数据交换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多个组织如何通过假名化令牌、本地数据查找和受控操作边界进行安全合作，实现分布式推理。

Method: 使用Orpius平台进行多代理编排、工具执行和隐私保护通信，通过OperationRelay调用交换自然语言摘要，各代理操作自有数据。

Result: 成功演示了诊所、保险公司和专科医生网络之间的协作流程，包括假名化令牌生成、保险规则评估和适当性推荐。

Conclusion: 证明了分布式多代理系统的可行性，强调了架构模式、隐私考虑和通信流程，为未来去中心化系统研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

Conclusion: 提出的基于智能体的验证框架能够有效验证LLM生成的优化模型，通过软件测试方法确保模型满足自然语言描述的要求。

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.

TL;DR: 提出CorrectHDL框架，利用HLS结果作为功能参考来纠正LLM生成的HDL设计中的错误，在保持功能正确性的同时显著提升面积和功耗效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在硬件前端设计中因幻觉倾向导致的功能错误问题，结合LLM的生成能力和传统设计流程的严谨性。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的电路在面积和功耗效率上显著优于传统HLS设计，接近人工设计质量，同时保持功能正确性。

Conclusion: CorrectHDL框架有效结合了LLM的生成能力和传统IC设计流程的严谨性，展示了智能HDL设计的潜力和有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Bauplan——一个专为AI代理设计的湖仓架构，通过重新实现数据和计算隔离来解决传统湖仓无法满足代理访问模式的问题，确保代理工作流的正确性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI能力不断提升，但大多数企业认为代理不够可信，无法在生产数据上工作。传统湖仓不适合代理访问模式，需要设计围绕事务的基础设施来确保治理。

Method: 借鉴数据库MVCC的操作类比，提出Bauplan代理优先设计，在湖仓中重新实现数据和计算隔离，并提供了一个自修复管道的参考实现。

Result: Bauplan架构能够无缝耦合代理推理与所需的正确性和可信度保证，解决了代理工作流的基础设施问题。

Conclusion: 构建可信代理工作流的关键是从解决基础设施问题开始，通过专门设计的湖仓架构可以实现代理在生产数据上的可信操作。

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESG报告作为评估企业ESG表现的核心媒介，存在阅读顺序混乱和结构弱的问题，难以进行大规模理解。

Method: 整合了基于布局流的阅读顺序建模模块、由目录锚点引导的层次感知分割模块，以及将视觉元素上下文转换为连贯自然语言的多模态聚合管道。

Result: 在标注基准上的广泛实验表明，Pharos-ESG始终优于专用文档解析系统和通用多模态模型。

Conclusion: Pharos-ESG框架有效解决了ESG报告的结构化问题，并发布了首个大型公开ESG报告数据集Aurora-ESG，为金融治理和决策提供支持。

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

Motivation: 现有联邦VLM适应方法需要迭代训练，通信成本高且易受攻击。单次联邦训练技术虽能减少通信轮次，但在适应VLM时面临多模态信息利用不足、数据异构处理策略缺乏以及需要额外训练资源等挑战。

Result: 在9个数据集的各种联邦设置下进行广泛实验，证明了TOFA方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TOFA是一种高效、轻量级的无训练单次联邦VLM适应框架，能够充分利用预训练VLM的多模态特征，有效处理数据异构问题，且无需额外训练资源。

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

TL;DR: PersonaDrift是一个用于评估机器学习方法检测痴呆症患者日常沟通行为渐进变化的合成基准，模拟60天交互日志，重点关注情感扁平化和话题偏离两种变化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症患者的沟通行为会逐渐变化，但现有计算工具缺乏跟踪这种渐进变化的能力，需要专门的方法来检测行为漂移。

Method: 基于护理人员访谈创建合成用户模型，模拟60天交互日志，注入渐进式变化（情感扁平化和话题偏离），评估多种异常检测方法包括统计模型、序列模型和监督分类器。

Result: 情感扁平化在基线变异性低的用户中可用简单统计模型检测，而语义漂移需要时序建模和个性化基线；个性化分类器在所有任务中都优于通用分类器。

Conclusion: 检测痴呆症患者沟通行为变化需要个性化方法，个体行为背景对于准确检测渐进变化至关重要。

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记作为富含详细患者观察的非结构化文档，为医学本体扩展提供了有价值但未充分利用的资源。直接利用临床笔记进行本体扩展仍未被充分探索。

Method: 利用预训练大语言模型的强大语言理解和广泛生物医学知识，自动识别疾病相关概念并捕获复杂层次关系，通过自动移除受保护健康信息确保患者隐私。

Result: 实验结果表明CLOZE提供了一个准确、可扩展且保护隐私的本体扩展框架。

Conclusion: CLOZE具有支持生物医学研究和临床信息学中广泛下游应用的强大潜力。

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

Method: 提出基于Marr层级的分类框架，将挑战分为三个强度程度：对计算功能主义的挑战（程度1）、实践性挑战（程度2）和严格不可能性论证（程度3）。

Result: 应用该框架分析了科学和哲学文献中的14个显著例子，成功区分了不同类型的挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为数字意识辩论提供了结构化的分析工具，有助于澄清和分类各种挑战，但不旨在支持任何特定立场。

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

TL;DR: D-GARA是一个动态基准测试框架，用于评估Android GUI智能体在真实世界异常情况下的鲁棒性，填补了现有静态基准测试无法反映现实复杂性的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI智能体数据集和基准测试大多是静态和理想化的，无法反映真实世界环境的复杂性和不可预测性，特别是异常情况的存在。

Method: 提出D-GARA框架，引入多种真实世界异常类型（如权限对话框、电池警告、更新提示等），构建包含常用Android应用和嵌入异常的基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，在异常丰富的环境中，最先进的GUI智能体性能显著下降，表明需要鲁棒性感知学习。

Conclusion: D-GARA是模块化和可扩展的，支持无缝集成新任务、异常类型和交互场景，以满足特定的评估目标。

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

TL;DR: YOFO是一种基于模板的多模态大语言模型评判方法，通过单次前向传播同时验证多个结构化需求，在保持可解释性的同时实现数量级的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM评判方法面临基本权衡：让MLLM输出单一分数与其生成性质不符且限制细粒度需求理解，而自回归生成评判分析在高吞吐场景下速度过慢。

Method: 基于自回归模型构建YOFO，接受结构化需求模板，在单次推理步骤中通过读取每个需求关联的最终token的logits，为每个需求生成二元是/否决策。

Result: 在标准推荐数据集上实现最先进结果，支持依赖感知分析（后续判断基于先前判断），并能从后验思维链中获益。

Conclusion: YOFO在保持可解释性的同时实现了数量级的速度提升，为MLLM评判提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

TL;DR: DPPO是一个元认知训练框架，通过动态交替监督微调和强化学习来解决具身智能中的数据瓶颈和算法效率问题，在有限数据下实现自动弱点识别和针对性资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身智能中的两个主要挑战：真实世界数据稀缺昂贵的数据瓶颈，以及现有方法算法效率低下、资源消耗大的问题。

Method: 提出Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO)框架，包含一个'Metaloop'训练机制，动态交替进行监督微调（能力扩展）和强化学习（技能精炼）。

Result: 使用DPPO训练的视觉语言具身模型Pelican-VL 1.0相比基础模型性能提升20.3%，在100B参数规模上超越开源模型10.6%。

Conclusion: DPPO是首个系统性缓解数据和资源瓶颈的框架，使社区能够高效构建多功能具身智能体，相关模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

TL;DR: MedBayes-Lite是一个轻量级的贝叶斯增强框架，用于提升基于transformer的临床语言模型的不确定性感知能力，无需重新训练即可显著改善预测校准度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的transformer模型在临床决策支持中容易过度自信，特别是在医疗模糊案例中，需要可靠的不确定性量化来确保预测的可靠性。

Method: 该框架包含三个组件：贝叶斯嵌入校准（使用蒙特卡洛dropout）、不确定性加权注意力（对token可靠性进行边际化）和置信度引导决策塑造（受临床风险最小化启发）。

Result: 在生物医学QA和临床预测基准测试中，MedBayes-Lite将过度自信降低了32-48%，在模拟临床环境中可防止高达41%的诊断错误。

Conclusion: MedBayes-Lite能够有效实现可靠的不确定性传播，提高医疗AI系统的可解释性，且参数开销低于3%。

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithmic trading system specifically designed for the EUR-USD pair within the high-frequency environment of the Forex market. The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.

TL;DR: 该研究通过认知科学框架分析LLM推理机制，发现模型与人类在推理结构上存在系统性差异，并开发了基于认知模式的测试时推理指导方法，显著提升复杂问题解决能力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂问题上表现良好但在简单变体上失败，表明其推理机制与人类不同。研究旨在通过认知科学框架理解这种差异，并改进模型推理能力。

Method: 构建包含28个认知元素的分类法，分析17个模型的17万条推理轨迹和54条人类思维轨迹，进行大规模比较分析，并开发测试时推理指导方法。

Result: 发现人类使用层次嵌套和元认知监控，而模型依赖浅层前向链推理；开发的方法在复杂问题上性能提升高达60%。

Conclusion: 通过连接认知科学和LLM研究，为开发基于原则性认知机制而非脆弱捷径的推理模型奠定了基础，为改进模型能力和测试人类认知理论开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.
