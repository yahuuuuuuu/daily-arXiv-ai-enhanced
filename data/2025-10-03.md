*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVTINO是首个基于视频一致性模型的零样本高分辨率视频恢复方法，通过绕过自动微分实现高效重建，在保持时间一致性的同时显著优于逐帧图像扩散模型方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像扩散模型的零样本逆求解器在视频恢复中面临时间不一致性问题，需要开发能够同时恢复空间细节和捕捉时间依赖性的视频恢复方法。

Method: 利用视频一致性模型(VCMs)作为先验，提出LVTINO零样本逆求解器，通过条件机制绕过自动微分，仅需少量神经网络评估即可实现高质量视频重建。

Result: 在多种视频逆问题上，LVTINO在重建保真度和计算效率方面均显著优于当前最先进的逐帧图像LDM方法，实现了感知质量的显著提升。

Conclusion: LVTINO通过视频一致性模型先验成功解决了视频恢复中的时间一致性问题，为高分辨率视频逆问题建立了新的基准。

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [2] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于风格提取的三阶段训练图像生成方法，通过风格编码器和投影层将风格表示与文本表示对齐，实现细粒度文本引导的风格化图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型中细粒度风格难以用自然语言精确描述和控制的问题，以及风格参考图像的指导信息难以与传统文本引导生成对齐的挑战。

Method: 使用风格编码器和风格投影层从单一风格参考图像中提取细粒度风格表示，并将其注入到预训练生成模型中，不改变下游生成模型的结构框架。构建了包含图像、风格标签和文本描述三元组的Style30k-captions数据集来训练模型。

Result: 实现了细粒度可控的风格化图像生成，能够通过文本提示精确控制生成图像的风格特征。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了预训练生成模型的生成能力，通过风格表示与文本表示的对齐，实现了细粒度文本引导的风格化图像生成。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [3] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究收集了一个包含61.68小时视频、2,793个视频片段和5,385个标注时间段的挣扎检测数据集，用于识别技能学习过程中的挣扎行为，并通过时间动作定位模型实现了跨任务和跨活动的挣扎检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操作数据集未关注挣扎行为随时间的变化，而理解挣扎的演变对于确定用户当前学习阶段和开发有效辅助系统至关重要。

Method: 收集了76名参与者在18个任务（分为打结、折纸、七巧板、洗牌四类活动）上的重复执行视频数据，将挣扎检测定义为时间动作定位任务，使用TAL模型识别和定位挣扎时间段。

Result: 时间动作定位模型能够成功学习检测挣扎线索，在未见任务上平均mAP达到34.56%，在未见活动上达到19.24%，表明挣扎是一个可跨任务迁移的概念。

Conclusion: 挣扎检测在技能学习任务中具有可迁移性，但仍有改进空间，该数据集为研究技能获取过程中的挣扎行为提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

### [4] [SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370)
*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS是一个紧凑高效的偏微分方程求解基础模型，使用轻量级残差U-Net架构，通过自回归预训练策略学习物理规律，在多种PDE任务上实现最先进的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要基于大型复杂Transformer架构，计算和参数开销高，需要开发更紧凑高效的统一神经算子。

Method: 采用轻量级残差U-Net架构，使用自回归预训练策略模拟数值求解器行为，在多样化流体动力学PDE数据集上预训练。

Result: 在6个未见下游PDE任务上实现最先进泛化性能，参数数量显著减少，仅需少量微调数据。

Conclusion: SPUS展示了作为参数高效基础模型解决多样化PDE系统的潜力，残差U-Net架构在此领域具有良好前景。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [5] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过多样性约束直接优化多人生成中的身份多样性，解决了文本到图像模型在多人提示中复制面孔、合并身份和计数错误的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在生成多人图像时存在身份多样性问题，包括面孔重复、身份合并和个体计数错误。

Method: 使用Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)微调流匹配模型，采用组合奖励函数：(i)惩罚图像内面部相似性，(ii)阻止跨样本身份重复，(iii)确保准确人数计数，(iv)通过人类偏好分数保持视觉保真度。采用单阶段课程学习稳定训练。

Result: 在DiverseHumans测试集上，DisCo达到98.6%的独特面孔准确率和接近完美的全局身份分布，超越开源和专有方法（如Gemini、GPT-Image），同时保持竞争力的感知质量。

Conclusion: DisCo是一个可扩展、无需额外标注的解决方案，解决了生成模型中长期存在的身份危机，为组合式多人生成设定了新基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

### [6] [GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of Geographic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01448)
*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的视觉地理定位方法，通过将查询图像的视觉表示与学习的地理表示对齐来实现全球范围内的图像地理定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉地理定位方法在学习地理表示方面仍有改进空间，需要更有效地将视觉内容与地理位置信息相结合。

Method: 构建了层次化的地理嵌入表示，并开发了将查询图像的外观特征与其语义分割图高效融合的方法，形成鲁棒的视觉表示。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上的25个指标中，22个指标达到了新的最佳性能，超越了现有最先进方法和大型视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 通过结合地理表示和视觉表示的方法，显著提升了视觉地理定位的性能，消融研究证实了这种组合的有效性。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [7] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了XMAS方法，通过分析跨模态注意力矩阵的轨迹来消除LVLM训练数据中的冗余，能在保留模型性能的同时大幅减少训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)上表现不佳，甚至无法超越随机选择，需要开发专门针对LVLM的高效数据选择方法。

Method: XMAS方法基于跨模态注意力矩阵相似性原理，通过聚类注意力矩阵的奇异值轨迹，从聚类中平衡采样来构建训练子集。

Result: XMAS能丢弃LLaVA-665k数据集的50%和Vision-Flan数据集的85%，同时完全保留LLaVA-1.5-7B在10个下游基准上的性能，并加速训练1.2倍。

Conclusion: XMAS是首个针对LVLM指令调优的高效数据选择方法，能显著减少训练数据冗余，提高训练效率而不损失模型性能。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

### [8] [Purrception: Variational Flow Matching for Vector-Quantized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01478)
*Răzvan-Andrei Matişan,Vincent Tao Hu,Grigory Bartosh,Björn Ommer,Cees G. M. Snoek,Max Welling,Jan-Willem van de Meent,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Floor Eijkelboom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Purrception是一种用于向量量化图像生成的变分流匹配方法，结合了连续传输动态和明确的分类监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么缺乏几何感知（分类方法），要么缺乏离散监督（连续方法），需要一种能同时兼顾两者的方法。

Method: 将变分流匹配适配到向量量化潜在空间，在连续嵌入空间计算速度场的同时学习码书索引的分类后验分布。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务上，训练收敛速度比连续和离散流匹配基线更快，同时达到与最先进模型竞争的FID分数。

Conclusion: 变分流匹配能有效桥接连续传输和离散监督，提高图像生成的训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

### [9] [AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498)
*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一深度学习框架，从非对比CT扫描生成合成对比增强CT图像，同时分割主动脉腔和血栓，通过条件扩散模型和多任务学习实现端到端联合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比增强CT需要碘造影剂，存在肾毒性、过敏反应和环境危害等风险。现有方法采用多阶段流程，导致误差累积且无法利用共享的语义和解剖结构。

Method: 集成条件扩散模型与多任务学习，共享编码器和解码器参数，采用半监督训练策略处理缺失分割标签的临床数据。

Result: 在264名患者队列中，图像合成PSNR达25.61 dB，优于单任务CDM的23.80 dB；分割性能提升，腔Dice分数从0.87提高到0.89，血栓Dice分数从0.48提高到0.53。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少造影剂使用的同时，提高了图像合成和分割的准确性，为临床主动脉瘤评估提供了更安全的替代方案。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

### [10] [From Videos to Indexed Knowledge Graphs -- Framework to Marry Methods for Multimodal Content Analysis and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01513)
*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多模态内容分析的高效原型框架，将预训练模型与视频数据结合，生成可查询的知识图谱表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态内容分析复杂且计算昂贵，现有预训练模型与视频等复杂数据的融合具有挑战性，需要简化工程实现。

Method: 设计候选流程配方，结合预训练模型将视频转换为时序半结构化数据，再进一步转换为可查询的帧级索引知识图谱。

Result: 构建了支持持续学习和动态集成领域特定知识的交互式知识图谱表示系统。

Conclusion: 该框架有效简化了多模态内容分析的原型开发，支持动态知识集成和查询功能。

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WALT框架通过逆向工程网站功能创建可调用工具，使Web代理能够使用高级操作（如搜索、过滤、排序）而非逐步UI交互，提高浏览器自动化的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Web代理方法依赖逐步UI交互和大量LLM推理，在动态布局和长任务中表现脆弱。相比之下，人类利用网站提供的高级功能操作，因此需要开发能发现和重用网站内置功能的自动化框架。

Method: WALT通过逆向工程揭示网站的潜在功能，将其转化为可重用的可调用工具，包括发现（搜索、过滤、排序）、通信（发布、评论、点赞）和内容管理（创建、编辑、删除）等操作。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena测试中，WALT实现了更高的成功率，使用更少的步骤和更少的LLM依赖推理，证明了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: WALT通过将计算负担从脆弱的逐步推理转移到可靠的工具调用，为浏览器自动化建立了稳健且可泛化的新范式。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

*Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Shahira Abousamra,Chen Li,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于半监督分割的拓扑一致性框架，通过整合多个扰动预测来保持语义结构，特别适用于密集分布的病理图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督分割中，从未标记数据中捕获有意义的语义结构至关重要，特别是在病理图像分析中，物体密集分布，这带来了挑战。

Method: 利用随机dropout和时间训练快照获得多个扰动预测，通过整合空间重叠和全局结构对齐的新匹配策略，强制这些不同输出之间的拓扑一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法有效减少了拓扑错误，产生了更鲁棒和准确的分割结果，这对于可靠的下游分析至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法通过拓扑一致性机制成功区分了生物上有意义的结构与瞬态噪声伪影，在半监督分割中实现了更可靠的性能。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Diffusion-LPO框架，通过列表偏好优化方法改进扩散模型与人类偏好的对齐效果，相比传统的成对偏好优化方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于成对偏好的DPO方法无法充分利用人类反馈中的隐含排序信息，而列表偏好能更精确地表达人类偏好。

Method: 基于Plackett-Luce模型推导列表扩展的DPO目标，给定标题时聚合用户反馈为图像排序列表，强制整个排序的一致性。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务中，Diffusion-LPO在视觉质量和偏好对齐方面一致优于成对DPO基线。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO是一个简单有效的列表偏好优化框架，能更好地利用人类反馈中的排序信息来对齐扩散模型与人类偏好。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建同时支持理解和生成的统一多模态大语言模型具有挑战性：混合方法破坏了自回归范式，而纯自回归方法在语义对齐和像素级保真度之间存在权衡。

Method: 采用混合Transformer架构，通过语义到像素的离散表示整合紧凑语义token和细粒度像素token，在预训练视觉理解模型基础上增加生成能力。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，Bridge在理解和生成任务上都取得了有竞争力或更优的结果，序列长度仅增加7.9%。

Conclusion: Bridge证明了在单一自回归框架内实现高质量多模态理解和生成的可行性，为统一多模态模型提供了有效解决方案。

models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

*Akshay Bhagwan Sonawane,Lena D. Swamikannan,Lakshman Tamil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和贝叶斯深度学习的混合模型，用于小数据集下的口腔癌分类，通过不确定性量化提高模型可靠性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔癌是全球高发癌症，早期诊断对降低死亡率至关重要。传统深度学习模型需要大数据集，在医疗资源匮乏地区难以满足，且存在过度自信和泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络与贝叶斯深度学习相结合的混合模型，采用变分推理进行不确定性量化，在小型训练集上训练口腔癌分类模型。

Result: 在训练数据分布相似的测试集上达到94%准确率，与传统CNN相当；在真实世界照片数据上表现更优，达到88%准确率（传统CNN为72.94%）。模型对正确分类样本显示低不确定性，对错误分类样本显示高不确定性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推理在数据稀缺环境下能有效提高口腔癌早期诊断的模型可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出CADTrans方法解决无源域自适应问题，通过构建辅助域和一致性策略获得不变特征表示，使用条件多核最大均值差异对齐难样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法主要关注评估目标域中与源域相似的不变特征，但容易受到难样本和域偏差的影响，无法充分表示多样性。

Method: 构建辅助域模块从中间聚合全局注意力获得多样化表示，通过多重一致性策略获取不变特征表示，使用CMK-MMD策略对齐难样本到对应易样本。

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VISDA-C和DomainNet-126等多个基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了所提方法带来的显著性能改进。

Conclusion: CADTrans通过构建域一致性的不变特征表示，有效解决了SFDA中难样本和域偏差的问题，在多个数据集上取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

*Ricardo Gonzalez Penuela,Felipe Arias-Russi,Victor Capriles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个系统，利用BLV用户的历史视觉问题来指导MLLM生成更相关的图像描述，相比无上下文描述，76.1%的情况下能预判并回答用户问题，54.4%的情况下更受偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM在视觉解释应用中为盲人和低视力用户提供描述时，往往默认生成冗长全面的描述，缺乏上下文相关性，导致用户需要筛选大量无关信息。

Method: 基于VizWiz-LF数据集中的历史BLV用户问题，当给定图像时，系统识别相似的过往视觉上下文，并用相关问题指导MLLM生成更符合BLV用户需求的描述。

Result: 评估显示，上下文感知描述在76.1%的情况下能预判并回答用户问题（70/92），在54.4%的比较中更受偏好（50/92）。

Conclusion: 利用BLV用户的历史视觉问题指导MLLM能有效生成更相关、更符合用户需求的图像描述，提高视觉解释的效率和质量。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

Conclusion: NPN方法通过关注零空间结构，提供了解释性强且灵活的正则化方案，能有效提升各种成像逆问题的重建质量

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: 该工作为基因组医学中的机器人和临床自动化建立了可靠基础，弥合了可解释基因组建模与自动化决策之间的差距。

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation
in genomic medicine.

TL;DR: VLA-R1是一个增强推理能力的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过强化学习从可验证奖励和组相对策略优化来系统优化推理和执行能力，在泛化性和真实世界性能上优于现有VLA方法。

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过系统优化推理和执行能力，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化性能和真实世界应用效果，并计划发布模型、代码和数据集。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合去模糊和3D重建的方法，用于解决微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，通过可微分渲染自监督优化3D模型和散焦模糊核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微距摄影具有高分辨率和大放大倍率的优势，但散焦模糊严重阻碍了清晰成像和高质量3D重建。传统方法需要大量图像和标注，且目前没有针对微距摄影的多视角3D重建方法。

Method: 从多视角模糊图像出发，联合优化物体的清晰3D模型和每个像素的散焦模糊核。整个框架采用可微分渲染方法，自监督优化3D模型和散焦模糊核。

Result: 大量实验表明，从少量多视角图像中，该方法不仅能实现高质量图像去模糊，还能恢复高保真度的3D外观。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，实现了联合去模糊和3D重建，为小物体的高质量3D建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Conclusion: FideDiff为预训练扩散模型在高保真图像恢复任务中的应用提供了新方向，为在现实工业应用中进一步推进扩散模型建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青铜器铭文是早期中国文字的重要阶段，但由于严重的视觉退化、多领域变异性（照片、拓片、摹本）和极端长尾字符分布，自动识别仍然困难。

Method: 构建大规模BI数据集（22454张全页图像，198598个标注字符，6658个类别），开发两阶段检测-识别流程，使用LadderMoE增强CLIP编码器，实现动态专家专业化和更强鲁棒性。

Result: 在单字符和全页识别任务上，该方法显著优于最先进的场景文本识别基线，在头部、中部和尾部类别以及所有采集模态上都实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 这些结果为青铜器铭文识别和下游考古分析建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VirDA提出了一种通过视觉重编程实现无监督领域自适应的方法，仅需在预训练骨干网络前添加轻量的视觉重编程层来生成视觉提示，无需修改骨干网络参数，大幅减少了可训练参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA方法需要为每个新的源-目标对微调整个骨干网络，导致训练参数和存储需求线性增长，且无法重用训练好的骨干网络参数。

Method: 在骨干网络前添加领域特定的视觉重编程层，生成视觉提示作为纹理偏置来调整输入图像的风格。通过优化多个目标函数来最小化域内和域间分布差异，同时保持骨干网络参数不变。

Result: 在Office-31数据集上达到92.8%的平均准确率，仅需1.5M可训练参数。相比PDA方法准确率提升1.6%，参数减少54%；相比全骨干微调方法，参数仅需1.7%-2.8%，准确率仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: VirDA通过视觉重编程实现了参数高效的领域自适应，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少了可训练参数，支持骨干网络在不同领域间的重用。

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在重建精度和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Con-NRSfM方法消除了传统约束，能够准确计算共形尺度并实现更精确的深度估计，为非刚性结构恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

*Jin Cao,Hongrui Wu,Ziyong Feng,Hujun Bao,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVerse是一个统一的鲁棒重建框架，通过将不一致的多视角图像转换为视频，使用视频扩散模型恢复一致性，然后进行3D重建，解决了稀疏观测下的鲁棒重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集观测来优化模型参数，难以处理图像不一致问题。本文旨在解决稀疏观测条件下的鲁棒3D重建挑战。

Method: 将鲁棒重建解耦为恢复和重建两个子任务：首先将不一致图像转换为初始视频，然后使用专门设计的视频扩散模型恢复为一致图像，最后从恢复的图像重建3D场景。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法具有强大的泛化能力和优越的鲁棒重建性能，并能控制重建3D场景的风格。

Conclusion: UniVerse通过利用扩散模型学习的大规模数据先验，能够处理多样化的图像不一致问题，在稀疏观测条件下实现了有效的鲁棒3D重建。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级端到端模板匹配框架，将模板匹配重新定义为联合定位和几何回归问题，输出中心坐标、旋转角度和独立缩放比例，在复杂背景下实现高效的目标位置和几何状态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖角度和尺度的穷举枚举导致效率低下，而大多数深度学习方法只估计相似度分数而不显式建模几何姿态，无法满足实际部署需求。

Method: 使用模板感知动态卷积模块动态注入模板特征，集成深度可分离卷积和像素洗牌实现高效匹配，采用旋转-剪切增强策略实现无几何标注训练，并添加轻量级细化模块优化角度和尺度精度。

Result: 3.07M参数模型在复合变换下实现高精度和14ms推理时间，在小模板和多目标场景中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法非常适合实时工业应用部署，在复杂背景下实现了高效准确的模板匹配。

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个自适应像素推理框架，通过动态确定必要的像素级操作来提升视觉语言模型的细粒度视觉理解能力，在保持高性能的同时显著减少不必要的视觉操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理需要精确理解细粒度视觉元素的任务时经常遇到困难，主要由于图像编码过程中的信息丢失或对关键区域关注不足。现有方法虽然通过引入像素级视觉信息有所改进，但往往过度使用这些信息，导致效率低下和无关视觉细节的干扰。

Method: 首先应用操作感知的监督微调建立文本推理和视觉操作的基础能力，然后设计新颖的基于模型自身响应反馈的rollout引导强化学习框架，使VLM能够根据查询难度动态决定何时调用像素操作。

Result: 在广泛的多模态推理基准测试中，模型实现了优越性能，同时显著减少了不必要的视觉操作。在HR-Bench 4K上达到73.4%的准确率，工具使用率仅为20.1%，相比先前方法在提高准确率的同时减少了66.5%的工具使用。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应像素推理框架有效解决了VLM在细粒度视觉理解中的挑战，通过动态决策机制实现了性能与效率的平衡，为视觉语言模型的高效推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出了增强敏感性风险评分（ASRS）框架，通过测量临床合理旋转后的嵌入变化来识别易出错的胸部X光片病例，提高医学AI的公平性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光片解读中性能良好，但在患者亚组间存在准确性不均的问题，现有错误检测方法难以处理分布内的细微错误。

Method: 应用临床合理的旋转（±15°/±30°），使用RAD-DINO编码器测量嵌入变化，通过敏感性评分将样本分层为稳定性四分位数。

Result: 高敏感性病例的召回率显著降低（-0.2到-0.3），尽管AUROC和置信度较高。ASRS能够无标签地进行选择性预测和临床医生审查。

Conclusion: ASRS框架为医学AI提供了一种无标签的错误检测方法，有助于改善公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频风格化方法存在时间一致性差、风格丰富度不足的问题，而训练专门的视频风格化模型需要配对视频数据且计算成本高。

Method: 使用预训练的图像到视频模型，整合多个风格化参考，采用高频补偿约束内容布局和运动，结合基于光流的运动线索来保留低显著性区域的风格纹理。

Result: FreeViS在风格化保真度和时间一致性方面优于现有基线方法，获得强烈的人类偏好，无需训练即可实现高质量视频风格化。

Conclusion: FreeViS提供了一个实用且经济的解决方案，能够生成具有丰富风格细节和强时间一致性的风格化视频。

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法受限于标量评分指标，无法反映专家评估中的人类推理过程，需要建立更符合人类推理的评估范式。

Method: 建立MedQ-Bench基准，包含MedQ-Perception（低层感知能力评估）和MedQ-Reasoning（无参考和比较推理任务），采用多维度评判协议和放射科医生验证。

Result: 评估14个最先进的MLLMs显示模型具有初步但不稳定的感知和推理技能，临床应用的准确性不足。

Conclusion: 需要针对性地优化MLLMs在医学图像质量评估中的能力，MedQ-Bench将推动该领域的进一步探索。

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

Motivation: 在视觉模型中理解实例级几何关系具有挑战性，现有方法需要昂贵的输入格式和推理成本。

Method: InstaFormer通过对象查询与潜在掩码描述符之间的交互，语义地表示相同对象并携带互补信息。

Result: 通过综合基准测试和消融实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: InstaFormer能够以单次前向传播从RGB图像中预测完整的遮挡和深度排序，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this
URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

TL;DR: PyramidStyler是一个基于Transformer的神经风格迁移框架，通过金字塔位置编码和强化学习优化，实现了高效的高分辨率图像风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN和Transformer模型在处理复杂风格和高分辨率输入时效率不足，需要更高效的风格迁移方法。

Method: 使用金字塔位置编码(PPE)来捕获多尺度特征，并结合强化学习动态优化风格化过程。

Result: 在4000轮训练后，内容损失降低62.6%至2.07，风格损失降低57.4%至0.86，推理时间1.39秒；使用RL后内容损失2.03，风格损失0.75，推理时间1.40秒。

Conclusion: PyramidStyler实现了实时高质量艺术渲染，在媒体和设计领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media
and design.

TL;DR: LoBE-GS是一个负载均衡的高效3D高斯溅射框架，通过深度感知分区、优化策略和轻量级技术，解决了大规模场景重建中的负载不平衡和效率问题，实现2倍训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分治方法在大规模无边界场景中存在两个瓶颈：(i)分区负载严重不平衡，(ii)粗到细流水线效率低下，导致高开销。

Method: 引入深度感知分区方法减少预处理时间，采用基于优化的策略平衡可见高斯分布，并使用可见性裁剪和选择性致密化两种轻量级技术降低训练成本。

Result: 在大规模城市和户外数据集上，LoBE-GS比最先进基线快2倍，保持重建质量，并能扩展到传统3DGS无法处理的场景。

Conclusion: LoBE-GS通过重新设计大规模3DGS流水线，有效解决了负载平衡和效率问题，为大规模场景重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

TL;DR: 提出MemoryPack和Direct Forcing两种方法，分别解决长视频生成中的长程依赖建模和自回归解码错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成面临双重挑战：需要捕获长程依赖关系，同时防止自回归解码中的错误累积。

Method: 1. MemoryPack：可学习的上下文检索机制，利用文本和图像信息作为全局指导，联合建模短期和长期依赖关系；2. Direct Forcing：高效的单步近似策略，改善训练-推理对齐，减少推理过程中的错误传播。

Result: 实现了分钟级的时间一致性，计算效率高且保持线性复杂度，显著提升了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: MemoryPack和Direct Forcing共同推进了自回归视频模型的实际可用性，为长视频生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

Motivation: 在自主系统中，精确的目标检测和不确定性估计对于自感知和安全操作至关重要。需要关注完整预测置信度分布在所有类别上的校准，而不仅仅是主导类别。

Method: 提出了两种辅助正则化损失项：一种是校准主导预测，另一种是校准完整预测向量。评估了多种后处理和训练时方法，包括等渗回归。

Result: 结合完整类别预测校准损失项和等渗回归的方法在CenterPoint和PillarNet上取得了最佳校准效果，但DSVT-Pillar无法使用相同方法同时校准主导和次要预测。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效改善3D目标检测器的置信度校准，特别是对完整预测分布的校准，但不同检测器架构可能需要不同的校准策略。

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Motivation: 现有行人搜索方法主要使用ImageNet预训练骨干网络，可能无法充分捕捉复杂空间上下文和细粒度身份线索。同时，它们共享骨干网络特征用于检测和重识别，导致优化目标冲突。

Method: 提出DiffPS框架，利用预训练扩散模型，包含三个模块：扩散引导区域提议网络(DGRPN)用于改进行人定位，多尺度频率精炼网络(MSFRN)缓解形状偏差，语义自适应特征聚合网络(SFAN)利用文本对齐的扩散特征。

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: DiffPS通过利用扩散先验知识有效解决了行人搜索中检测和重识别任务的优化冲突问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

Motivation: 高光谱成像成本高且重建困难，压缩感知系统如CASSI存在严重退化问题，需要更准确的重建方法。

Method: 提出流匹配引导的展开网络(FMU)，将流匹配的生成先验嵌入深度展开框架，引入平均速度损失增强流动力学一致性。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，FMU在重建质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMU成功结合了基于优化方法的可解释性和流匹配的生成能力，为HSI重建提供了更鲁棒和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业组件缺陷检测耗时费力，给质检人员带来负担且难以管理产品质量，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用数字相机光学和深度学习模型，针对DIP的表面和引脚缺陷，采用ConSinGAN生成训练数据集，比较YOLOv3/v4/v7/v9模型性能。

Conclusion: 该自动缺陷检测系统可轻松应用于多种缺陷类型或缺陷数据不足的情况，并开发了SCADA系统进行监控。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

*Guangyao Zhai,Yue Zhou,Xinyan Deng,Lars Heckler,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FoundAD方法，利用基础视觉编码器的大规模预训练能力，通过非线性投影算子检测图像中的异常区域，在少样本条件下实现多类别异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业安全检查中少样本异常检测面临样本有限、类别不可知等挑战，需要利用大规模预训练的基础编码器来学习正常图像的通用分布。

Method: 设计非线性投影算子，将图像投影到自然图像流形上，通过比较学习嵌入的差异来检测图像中的异常区域。

Result: 实验表明该方法支持多类别检测，性能具有竞争力，且参数数量显著少于先前方法，在多个基础编码器上验证有效。

Conclusion: 该方法拓展了基础特征的应用视角，推动了少样本异常检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

TL;DR: ClustViT通过可训练的聚类模块和再生器模块，在保持分割精度的同时显著降低了Vision Transformer的计算复杂度和推理时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在真实世界机器人系统中应用受限，因为其二次注意力复杂度。现有token合并方法适合分类任务但不适合密集预测任务

Method: 扩展ViT骨干网络，添加可训练的聚类模块根据分割掩码的伪聚类指导合并相似token，然后通过再生器模块恢复细节信息

Result: 在三个不同数据集上实现高达2.18倍更少的GFLOPs和1.64倍更快的推理速度，同时保持可比较的分割精度

Conclusion: ClustViT有效解决了ViT在密集预测任务中的计算效率问题，为实际机器人应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了PaDT（Patch-as-Decodable Token）统一范式，使多模态大语言模型能直接生成文本和多样化视觉输出，解决了现有方法依赖间接表示的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中依赖间接表示（如将坐标生成为文本），限制了性能并阻碍了分割等密集预测任务。

Method: 引入视觉参考标记（VRTs），从查询图像的视觉补丁嵌入中提取，与LLM输出文本标记交织；使用轻量级解码器将LLM输出转换为检测、分割和接地预测；动态扩展嵌入表以改进定位和相似对象区分。

Result: 在四个视觉感知和理解任务上的实证研究表明，PaDT始终达到最先进的性能，甚至优于显著更大的MLLM模型。

Conclusion: PaDT提供了一种统一范式，使MLLM能够直接生成多样化的视觉输出，在多个视觉任务上实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生鲜电商中因无法直接感知产品质量而导致的'信任赤字'问题，传统绝对分级标准存在生物特性、时效性和经济可行性之间的内在矛盾。

Method: 构建'信任金字塔'模型，提出'三角信任指数'量化分级权衡，设计TriAlignXA可解释AI框架，包含生物自适应引擎、时效优化引擎和经济优化引擎，并采用'预映射机制'将流程数据编码为二维码。

Result: 在分级任务实验中显著优于基线模型，实证和理论分析验证了框架在解决'不可能三角'方面的平衡能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可信赖的在线农产品生态系统提供了从理论到实践的全面支持，建立了从算法决策到消费者信任的关键路径。

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

TL;DR: 提出了4DGS-Craft框架，通过4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型、多视图网格模块和Gaussian选择机制，解决了4D高斯溅射编辑中的视图、时间一致性以及复杂文本指令处理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D高斯溅射编辑方法在视图一致性、时间一致性、非编辑区域保持以及复杂文本指令处理方面存在挑战，需要开发更一致和交互式的编辑框架。

Method: 1. 引入4D感知InstructPix2Pix模型，整合4D VGGT几何特征；2. 使用多视图网格模块迭代优化多视图输入图像；3. 提出Gaussian选择机制仅优化编辑区域的Gaussians；4. 设计基于LLM的用户意图理解模块，将复杂指令分解为原子操作序列。

Result: 相比相关工作，该方法实现了更一致和可控的4D场景编辑，能够处理复杂的用户指令并保持编辑质量。

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft框架通过结合几何感知编辑模型、一致性保持机制和智能意图理解，显著提升了4D高斯溅射编辑的连贯性和用户交互体验。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级超分辨率方法如CAMixer存在适应性差、掩码粒度粗和空间灵活性不足等问题，需要更精细的计算优化机制。

Method: 使用Pure-Pass像素级掩码机制，基于固定颜色中心点对像素进行分类，识别纯像素并免除其昂贵计算，实现细粒度和空间灵活的掩码。

Result: PP-ATD-light在重建质量和参数效率上优于CAMixer-ATD-light，在节省相似计算量的同时获得更优的超分辨率性能。

Conclusion: Pure-Pass机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了细粒度、空间灵活的自适应计算优化，为轻量级超分辨率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

Motivation: 利用多模态AI自动生成颌骨囊肿的放射学发现，提高诊断效率和准确性。

Method: 构建自校正循环与结构化输出(SLSO)框架，包含10步处理流程，包括图像分析、结构化数据生成、牙齿编号一致性检查等。

Result: SLSO框架在牙齿编号、牙齿移动和牙根吸收方面的准确率分别提升了66.9%、33.3%和28.6%，成功案例经过最多5次再生后获得一致性输出。

Conclusion: SLSO框架能有效抑制幻觉、提高牙齿编号识别准确性，但对跨越多颗牙齿的大范围病变识别仍有局限，需要进一步优化以实现实用化。

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Conclusion: LiLa-Net通过简化的架构设计实现了高效的3D点云重建，在资源消耗和性能之间取得了良好平衡，具有优秀的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original
traffic environment.

Motivation: 传统野外观察方法范围有限、耗时费力，难以评估跨景观的行为响应，需要可扩展的方法来量化复杂多维行为模式。

Method: 整合无人机视频与机器学习系统，利用目标检测、跟踪和行为分类技术，提取行为、社交和空间指标。

Conclusion: kabr-tools实现了规模化自动行为监测，为生态系统研究、保护和生态监测提供了强大工具。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖点云或需要预定义同胚映射来处理无纹理数据，这些方法存在局限性。本文旨在克服这些限制，实现更高质量的3D形状和纹理形变。

Method: 采用网格引导的3D高斯泼溅技术，通过统一变形策略将3D高斯锚定到重建的网格面片上，确保几何一致变换并保持纹理保真度。同时利用网格拓扑作为几何先验建立无监督语义对应，通过物理合理的点轨迹保持结构完整性。

Result: 在提出的TexMorph基准测试中，GaussianMorphing显著优于先前的2D/3D方法，将颜色一致性误差(ΔE)降低了22.2%，EI降低了26.2%。

Conclusion: GaussianMorphing框架能够在不依赖标记数据的情况下，有效实现语义感知的3D形状和纹理形变，在保持局部细节和全局语义一致性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

Motivation: 现有基于条件扩散模型的方法在跨用户泛化方面表现不佳，主要因为位置测量受用户体型影响较大。

Method: 将姿态估计建模为逆问题，使用预训练扩散模型仅以旋转测量为条件，通过基于测量位置的似然项指导生成过程。

Result: 提出的InPose方法能够为零样本泛化生成高度可能的姿态序列，准确解释稀疏的体上测量数据。

Conclusion: 通过将姿态估计视为逆问题并设计专门的算法，实现了跨用户的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

Conclusion: 变换器引导的扩散模型有潜力推动肿瘤分割技术发展，为神经肿瘤学提供改进的鲁棒性和可扩展性路径

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 分析SAM2等视频对象分割模型在腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中点跟踪的失败模式，发现点跟踪在手术工具上表现良好，但在解剖目标上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点跟踪在复杂手术环境中的可靠性和失败情况尚未被充分理解，需要系统分析其在腹腔镜胆囊切除术中的表现。

Method: 在腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中，对胆囊、抓钳和L型电钩三个手术目标，比较点跟踪与分割掩码初始化的性能。

Result: 点跟踪在手术工具上表现有竞争力，但在解剖目标上持续表现不佳，主要由于组织相似性和边界模糊导致失败。

Conclusion: 通过定性分析揭示了影响跟踪结果的关键因素，并提供了选择与放置跟踪点的实用建议，以改善手术视频分析性能。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

*Ding-Ruei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FFREEDG新任务：在服务器预训练后，仅使用客户端未标注数据进行联邦学习，不重新访问源数据。提出FRIEREN框架，利用视觉基础模型和视觉-语言解码器解决语义分割的领域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在语义分割任务中面临领域偏移挑战，特别是当客户端数据未标注时。现有方法要么不切实际地假设客户端有标注数据，要么未能充分利用现代视觉基础模型的能力。

Method: FRIEREN框架：1) 集成视觉和语言模态，使用CLIP文本嵌入引导的视觉-语言解码器改善语义消歧；2) 采用弱到强一致性学习策略，在伪标签上进行鲁棒的本地训练。

Result: 在合成到真实、清晰到恶劣天气等基准测试中，该框架有效解决了新任务，性能与现有领域泛化和适应方法相当，为未来研究设定了强基线。

Conclusion: FRIEREN框架成功解决了FFREEDG这一具有挑战性的联邦学习任务，展示了视觉基础模型在联邦语义分割中的潜力。

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint是一个基于动作知识的提示框架，通过细粒度的结构化提示来提升冻结视觉语言模型在视频异常检测中的性能，无需训练即可实现最先进的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法过于抽象，忽视了监控视频中定义复杂异常的人-物交互和动作语义等细粒度信息。

Method: 提出结构化提示框架，将提示组织成语义连贯的组别（如暴力、财产犯罪、公共安全），并制定细粒度的引导问题，使模型预测与判别性视觉线索对齐。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上的实验表明，ASK-Hint持续提升AUC，相比微调和无需训练的方法都达到了最先进性能，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提示的细粒度程度对性能至关重要，ASK-Hint为可解释的视频异常检测提供了一个无需训练且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

TL;DR: GeoPurify通过学生亲和网络和几何引导池化模块，利用3D自监督教师模型中的几何先验来净化2D VLM生成的3D点特征，有效解决了2D到3D特征转换中的噪声和几何不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D视觉语言模型特征向3D语义分割的转换方法存在权衡：直接投影会产生噪声和碎片化预测，而强制几何一致性需要昂贵的训练流程和大规模标注3D数据。

Method: 提出GeoPurify方法，使用小型学生亲和网络从3D自监督教师模型中提取几何先验来净化2D VLM生成的3D点特征，并在推理时采用几何引导池化模块进一步去噪。

Result: 在主要3D基准测试中，GeoPurify达到或超越了最先进性能，同时仅使用约1.5%的训练数据，表现出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: GeoPurify通过利用潜在几何信息和学习的亲和网络，有效缓解了2D到3D特征转换的权衡问题，实现了优越的性能和数据效率。

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于猪耳静脉模式的无创生物识别方法，使用智能手机采集图像，通过多阶段计算机视觉流程提取特征，SVM模型在混合品种猪群中达到98.12%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统猪只识别方法（如耳标、芯片）不可靠、成本高且主要针对纯种猪，不适用于小规模养殖户，需要一种低成本、无创的替代方案。

Method: 收集20头混合品种猪的800张耳部图像，使用标准智能手机和简单背光拍摄，开发多阶段计算机视觉流程增强静脉可见度，提取结构和空间特征生成生物特征签名，使用机器学习模型进行分类。

Result: 支持向量机（SVM）达到最高准确率：在混合品种猪群中正确识别猪只的精度为98.12%，从图像处理到分类的整个过程平均耗时8.3秒。

Conclusion: 该系统通过用永久生物标记替代易损物理标识，为养殖户提供了经济高效且无压力的动物识别方法，证实了耳静脉生物识别在数字化畜牧管理中的实用性，有望将精准农业的益处扩展到资源有限的农业社区。

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

Motivation: 解决密集和遮挡场景中离散检测方法失效的问题，需要开发能够处理多类别对象计数的密度图估计方法。

Method: 采用Twins金字塔视觉-transformer骨干网络，构建专门的多类计数头，基于最先进的多尺度解码方法，并添加基于分割的类别聚焦模块来抑制类别间干扰。

Result: 在VisDrone和iSAID基准测试中表现优异，相比之前的多类别人群计数方法，MAE分别降低了33%、43%和64%，与YOLOv11的比较证明了在密集场景中人群计数方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过区域损失为多类人群计数开辟了新领域，在生物多样性监测数据集上的应用展示了其支持保护工作和实现可扩展生态洞察的能力。

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

TL;DR: TempoControl是一种无需重新训练或额外监督的方法，通过优化交叉注意力图来实现视频生成中的时间对齐控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成视频模型缺乏细粒度的时间控制，无法让用户指定特定视觉元素在生成序列中出现的时间。

Method: 利用文本到视频扩散模型中的交叉注意力图，通过相关性、能量和熵三个互补原则来引导概念的时间安排。

Result: 该方法在多种视频生成应用中表现出色，包括单对象和多对象的时间重排序，以及动作和音频对齐的生成。

Conclusion: TempoControl能够在确保高质量和多样性的同时，实现对视频生成时间安排的精确控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

TL;DR: 提出了RewardMap框架，通过多阶段强化学习和难度感知奖励设计，解决了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉推理任务中的稀疏奖励和不稳定优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在结构化信息丰富的场景（如交通地图）中的空间推理能力不足，而标准强化学习面临稀疏奖励和优化不稳定的挑战。

Method: 构建ReasonMap-Plus数据集提供密集奖励信号，提出RewardMap多阶段RL框架，包含难度感知奖励设计和从简单感知到复杂推理的渐进训练策略。

Result: 在ReasonMap和ReasonMap-Plus上的实验显示RewardMap各组件均带来性能提升，组合使用效果最佳，在6个基准测试中平均提升3.47%。

Conclusion: RewardMap有效提升了MLLMs的视觉理解和推理能力，证明了多阶段RL和密集奖励设计在细粒度视觉推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DragFlow是首个利用FLUX强大先验进行拖拽式图像编辑的框架，通过区域级编辑范式和个性化适配器，显著提升了编辑质量，在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型从UNet-based DDPMs转向更强大的DiT with flow matching（如SD3.5、FLUX），生成先验显著增强，但拖拽式编辑尚未从中受益。现有方法在目标区域存在严重失真问题。

Method: 提出区域级编辑范式，使用仿射变换提供更丰富一致的特征监督；集成预训练开放域个性化适配器（如IP-Adapter）增强主体一致性；使用梯度掩码硬约束保护背景保真度；利用多模态大语言模型解决任务歧义。

Result: 在DragBench-DR和新建的ReD Bench基准测试中，DragFlow超越了基于点和基于区域的基线方法，在拖拽式图像编辑中达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DragFlow成功利用FLUX的强先验解决了拖拽编辑中的失真问题，通过区域级监督和个性化适配器实现了高质量的图像编辑效果。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型面临"大海捞针"问题：原始视频帧产生的大量视觉标记耗尽模型上下文窗口。现有解决方案通过选择稀疏帧来减少标记数量，但丢弃了基本的时间动态信息，导致运动和事件连续性推理不佳

Method: 提出F2C方法：1）从孤立关键帧扩展到关键片段（短时间连贯片段）；2）采用自适应分辨率策略，动态平衡空间分辨率和片段长度，确保每个视频的标记数量恒定

Result: 在三个长视频基准测试上，F2C方法相比均匀采样分别提升8.1%（Video-MME）、5.6%（LongVideoBench）和10.3%（MLVU）

Conclusion: 保持时间连贯性在帧选择中至关重要，为将视频大语言模型扩展到实际视频理解应用提供了实用途径

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习和可穿戴传感器的发展，需要在真实条件下准确评估人体运动，这对远程医疗、运动科学和康复至关重要。

Method: 使用VIDIMU数据集，包含13种临床相关日常活动，比较了MotionAGFormer、MotionBERT、MMPose 2D-to-3D姿态提升和NVIDIA BodyTrack等深度学习框架与基于IMU数据的关节角度计算。

Result: MotionAGFormer表现最优，总体RMSE为9.27°±4.80°，MAE为7.86°±4.18°，Pearson相关系数0.86±0.15，决定系数R²为0.67±0.28。

Conclusion: 两种技术都适用于实验室外运动学评估，但存在成本、可访问性和精度等方面的权衡，为研究人员和临床医生开发远程医疗解决方案提供了指导。

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Motivation: 解决从脑活动重建视觉信息中的跨被试泛化挑战，包括被试间神经表征差异和大脑对复杂视觉输入的抽象语义编码问题。

Method: 提出NeuroSwift框架，整合AutoKL适配器处理低级特征和CLIP适配器处理语义特征，通过预训练在一个被试上，然后仅微调新被试的17%参数（全连接层）。

Result: 在轻量级GPU（三块RTX 4090）上仅需每被试一小时训练，就能超越现有方法，实现最先进的跨被试视觉重建性能。

Conclusion: NeuroSwift通过互补适配器和参数高效微调策略，成功解决了跨被试视觉重建的挑战，为理解视觉神经机制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度图像分类中表现受限，因为它依赖粗粒度的全局特征，而忽略了空间精度。先前的方法通过对齐LLM描述与CLIP的[CLS]token来注入细粒度知识，但这种方法缺乏空间精度。

Method: 提出Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)机制构建显著性引导的[FG]token，并与[CLS]token融合；采用双头LLM衍生分类器：冻结分类器提供稳定的文本先验，可学习分类器从LLM描述初始化并微调；开发动态知识聚合，结合固定先验和TokenFusion的演化logits迭代优化伪标签。

Result: 在13个细粒度基准测试中平均准确率提升2.90%，仅需轻量级适配。

Conclusion: microCLIP框架能够有效挖掘CLIP中的潜在细粒度信号，显著提升细粒度分类性能，同时保持轻量适配要求。

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

TL;DR: VidGuard-R1是首个基于多模态大语言模型的视频真实性检测器，通过GRPO微调实现高精度检测和可解释性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频技术的快速发展，需要有效的检测工具来应对错误信息和声誉损害等社会风险，同时检测模型需要提供可解释的说明以确保监管机构和终端用户的透明度。

Method: 使用组相对策略优化(GRPO)微调多模态大语言模型Qwen-VL，构建包含14万真实和AI生成视频的挑战性数据集，并设计两个专门针对时间伪影和生成复杂度的奖励模型。

Result: 在现有基准测试中实现最先进的零样本性能，额外训练后准确率超过95%，案例研究显示模型能产生精确且可解释的预测理由。

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1通过结合高精度检测和可解释推理，为AI生成视频检测提供了有效的解决方案，代码已公开可用。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出一种无需长视频教师监督或重新训练的方法，通过利用教师模型的丰富知识为自生成长视频提供指导，有效缓解长视频生成中的质量退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像和视频生成方面取得了突破性进展，但基于transformer架构的计算成本过高，特别是在生成长视频时。现有自回归方法通过从短时双向教师模型蒸馏，但由于教师模型无法生成长视频，学生在训练范围外生成时会出现明显的质量下降。

Method: 利用教师模型的知识为自生成长视频提供指导，通过从自生成长视频中抽取片段进行引导，保持时间一致性，避免过度曝光和错误累积问题，无需重新计算重叠帧。

Result: 方法能够将视频长度扩展到教师模型能力的20倍以上，最高可生成4分15秒的视频，相当于基础模型位置嵌入支持的最大跨度的99.9%，比基线模型长50多倍。在标准基准测试和改进基准测试中，在保真度和一致性方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了长视频生成中的质量退化问题，无需长视频教师监督或重新训练，实现了高质量的长视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KineMask是一种物理引导的视频生成方法，通过两阶段训练策略实现逼真的刚体控制和物体交互，在合成和真实场景中都显著提升了物体交互的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在物体交互的物理合理性方面存在不足，缺乏基于物理的控制机制。本文旨在解决这一问题，使视频生成模型能够更好地服务于机器人学和具身决策等需要物理世界模拟的应用。

Method: 提出KineMask方法，采用两阶段训练策略：首先在合成场景中训练视频扩散模型，通过物体掩码逐步移除未来运动监督；结合低级运动控制（物体速度）和高级文本条件（预测性场景描述）来实现复杂动力学现象的合成。

Result: 实验表明KineMask在物体交互方面相比同类规模模型有显著提升，消融研究进一步证明了低级和高级条件在视频扩散模型中的互补作用。

Conclusion: KineMask通过物理引导的视频生成方法，成功实现了更逼真的物体交互和控制，为视频生成模型在物理世界模拟方面的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

Method: 开发了特征学习范式来对齐多模态感官，同时保留每个模态的独特信息；提出正则化方案增强动作轨迹特征在表示复杂交互动态时的因果性。

Result: 实验表明融合多模态感官提高了模拟精度并减少了时间漂移；广泛的消融研究和下游应用证明了方法的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 多模态感官的引入显著提升了机器人精细交互的模拟能力，为通用家用机器人的精细运动控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

TL;DR: VideoNSA通过原生稀疏注意力机制增强视频-语言模型的长视频理解能力，在Qwen2.5-VL基础上进行端到端训练，支持128K tokens，在长视频理解、时序推理和空间基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态语言模型中视频理解受限于上下文长度的问题，模型经常错过关键过渡帧，难以在长时间尺度上保持连贯性。

Method: 将原生稀疏注意力(NSA)适配到视频-语言模型中，采用硬件感知的混合注意力方法：文本使用密集注意力，视频使用NSA，在216K视频指令数据集上进行端到端训练。

Result: 相比token压缩和无训练稀疏基线，VideoNSA在长视频理解、时序推理和空间基准测试中表现更好，能够可靠扩展到128K tokens。

Conclusion: 研究发现：1)可靠扩展到128K tokens；2)固定预算下的最优全局-局部注意力分配；3)任务相关的分支使用模式；4)可学习的组合稀疏注意力有助于诱导动态注意力汇聚点。

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoiseShift是一种无需训练的方法，通过根据分辨率大小重新校准去噪器的噪声水平，显著提升扩散模型在低分辨率下的图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高分辨率文本到图像生成器无法为不需要高分辨率图像的用户提供即开即用的经济高效替代方案，因为扩散模型在固定分辨率集上训练后往往无法泛化到其他分辨率。

Method: 提出NoiseShift方法，识别噪声调度器在不同分辨率下具有不等的感知效果，通过重新校准去噪器在不同分辨率下的噪声水平来解决训练-测试不匹配问题。

Result: 在LAION-COCO数据集上，NoiseShift将SD3.5的FID提升15.89%，SD3提升8.56%，Flux-Dev提升2.44%；在CelebA数据集上，分别提升10.36%、5.19%和3.02%。

Conclusion: NoiseShift能有效缓解分辨率相关的伪影，提升低分辨率图像生成质量，且无需改变模型架构或采样计划，与现有模型兼容。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

TL;DR: 该论文研究从视频中预测动态物理属性的任务，包括弹性、粘度和动态摩擦，通过收集新数据集并探索三种推断方法，发现视频基础模型性能接近oracle方法，而多模态大语言模型目前表现较差但可通过提示改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何从视频中推断需要时间信息才能判断的动态物理属性，如物体的弹性、液体的粘度和表面的动态摩擦，这些属性对人类来说直观但对计算机视觉具有挑战性。

Method: 收集了三个物理属性的新视频数据集；探索了三种推断方法：(a) 使用传统计算机视觉技术的oracle方法，(b) 基于预训练视频生成和自监督模型的可训练提示向量方法，(c) 多模态大语言模型的提示策略。

Result: 生成式或自监督训练的视频基础模型性能相似，接近oracle方法但略差；多模态大语言模型目前表现较差，但通过合适的提示可以改善性能。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型在动态物理属性预测方面表现良好，接近oracle方法，而多模态大语言模型仍有改进空间，提示策略对其性能提升有帮助。

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Motivation: 日常物体互动会产生独特的声音，但现有模型难以区分类似声音（如勺子敲击木地板与地毯的区别），需要建立声音与直接参与物体的关联。

Method: 开发自动管道计算参与物体的分割掩码，引导模型关注互动中最具信息量的区域，并使用槽注意力视觉编码器强化对象先验。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态对象感知框架能够有效连接声音与物体，在声音对象检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Motivation: 随着NeRF和3DGS等3D场景表示方法的普及，分析其安全漏洞变得至关重要。本文旨在研究3DGS对图像级投毒攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用核密度估计(KDE)识别低密度区域，策略性地注入高斯点嵌入视角依赖的虚幻物体；引入自适应噪声策略破坏多视角一致性；提出基于KDE的攻击难度评估协议。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在性能上优于现有最先进技术，能够有效嵌入可见的虚幻物体，同时对无辜视角影响最小。

Conclusion: 提出的密度引导投毒攻击方法有效揭示了3DGS的脆弱性，为未来研究提供了客观的基准测试框架。

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型在单主体提示上表现良好，但在多主体描述时经常出现属性泄漏、身份纠缠和主体遗漏等问题，需要专门的方法来提升多主体保真度。

Method: 将流匹配通过随机最优控制视角重新表述，提出了两种架构无关的算法：无需训练的在测试时控制器和轻量级微调规则Adjoint Matching。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3.5、FLUX和Stable Diffusion XL等模型上，两种算法都一致提高了多主体对齐度，同时保持了基础模型的风格。

Conclusion: 提出的FOCUS方法在多主体保真度方面达到了最先进的性能，测试时控制可在普通GPU上高效运行，微调后的控制器能够泛化到未见过的提示。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

Motivation: 现有的人类行为建模方法要么对理性做出不切实际的假设，要么计算过于复杂难以快速适应。日常社交互动往往遵循可预测的模式（脚本），这为高效预测提供了机会。

Method: 将行为建模为计算机代码形式的行为程序，使用LLM合成行为程序的假设空间，结合概率推理处理不确定性。

Result: 在网格世界任务和大规模家庭模拟器中测试，ROTE在稀疏观测下预测人类和AI行为，比行为克隆和LLM方法在样本内准确性和样本外泛化能力上提升高达50%。

Conclusion: 通过将动作理解视为程序合成问题，ROTE为AI系统在现实世界中高效有效预测人类行为开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully

*Zarreen Reza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于多智能体辩论的新型评估框架，用于量化LLM在交互环境中的涌现社会行为，发现智能体具有强烈的共识寻求倾向，即使在没有明确指令的情况下也能达成高度语义一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估基准无法捕捉LLM作为自主智能体时在交互环境中产生的涌现社会认知动态，需要新的评估方法来理解智能体的社交行为。

Method: 使用多智能体辩论作为受控"社交实验室"，让具有不同角色和激励的LLM智能体在LLM主持人的监督下就各种挑战性话题进行辩论，并采用新的心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 发现智能体具有强大的共识寻求倾向（语义一致性μ>0.88），分配的角色会产生稳定的心理测量特征，主持人的角色能显著改变辩论结果，这对AI对齐具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 这项工作为面向智能体环境的新一代动态、基于心理测量的评估协议提供了蓝图，为理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为提供了关键方法学。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

TL;DR: AGILE通过将拼图任务构建为交互式学习过程，显著提升了视觉语言模型的感知和推理能力，在拼图任务上准确率从9.5%提升至82.8%，并在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解和推理方面虽有进步，但在基本感知和推理能力上仍有局限，特别是在简单拼图任务上表现接近随机水平。高质量视觉语言数据的稀缺性和有限可扩展性限制了模型能力的提升。

Method: AGILE将拼图解决构建为交互式过程，模型在每个步骤生成可执行代码执行动作，环境提供细粒度视觉反馈。通过观察和交互的迭代循环，模型通过探索和反馈逐步提升感知和推理能力。

Result: AGILE在2×2拼图任务中将准确率从9.5%大幅提升至82.8%，在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%，显示出感知和推理能力的显著增强。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进多模态模型的推理和泛化能力开辟了新途径，为解决多模态强化学习数据稀缺问题提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

TL;DR: MEMTRACK是一个用于评估多平台代理环境中长期记忆和状态跟踪的基准测试，模拟真实企业工作流程，整合Slack、Linear和Git等平台的异步事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文和记忆基准测试主要关注对话场景，但企业动态环境中记忆评估的需求对于其有效应用至关重要。

Method: 通过手动专家设计和基于代理的可扩展合成来策划MEMTRACK数据集，生成基于真实软件开发过程的生态有效场景，并引入正确性、效率和冗余性相关指标。

Result: 在SoTA LLMs和记忆后端上的实验显示，在长时程利用记忆、处理跨平台依赖和解决矛盾方面存在挑战，表现最佳的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上仅达到60%的正确性得分。

Conclusion: 这项工作为记忆增强代理的评估研究提供了一个可扩展框架，超越了现有对话设置的关注，并为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，整合非结构化叙述和结构化临床数据，通过自然语言处理生成上下文相关的治疗建议

Result: 初步评估显示模型输出具有临床合理性和一致性，LLM工具在适当约束和严格验证下可为处方工作流提供有价值的决策支持

Conclusion: 这是将生成式AI整合到真实临床决策中的初步尝试，强调透明度、安全性以及与既定实践的一致性

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE方法来检测隐式奖励黑客行为，通过截断思维链来量化模型解决问题的努力程度，在数学推理和编程任务中显著优于现有监控方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客行为（模型利用奖励函数漏洞获得高分但不解决实际任务）是一个严重威胁，特别是隐式黑客行为会绕过思维链监控，需要新的检测方法。

Method: TRACE方法通过逐步截断模型的思维链，强制模型在不同截断点回答问题，测量验证器通过率，计算准确率-长度曲线下的面积来量化模型努力程度。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，TRACE比最强的72B思维链监控器提升超过65%；在编程任务中，比32B监控器提升超过30%。还能在训练中发现未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督监督方法，在当前监控方法失效的情况下有效检测隐式奖励黑客行为。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种通过蒸馏将推理时检索转化为学习能力的简单管道，在多个交互基准测试中显著提升智能体性能，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在多步任务中经常出现可预测的失败，如尝试不满足前提条件的动作、发出冗余命令或错误处理环境约束。虽然检索增强生成可以改善性能，但需要维护外部知识库并增加计算开销。

Method: 方法包括：(1)从智能体失败中提取紧凑可重用的提示；(2)使用这些提示通过一次性检索在情节开始时生成改进的教师轨迹；(3)在移除提示字符串的情况下训练学生模型，强制内化而非记忆。

Result: 在ALFWorld（家务任务）和WebShop（在线购物）两个交互基准测试中，蒸馏后的学生模型始终优于基线智能体，ALFWorld成功率高达91%（基线为79%），WebShop得分提升至72（基线为61），同时使用的令牌数比检索增强教师少10-60%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模（7B/14B参数）和智能体架构（ReAct/StateAct）上均能泛化，表明检索优势可以通过有针对性的微调有效内化，而无需永久运行时依赖。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Conclusion: LLM代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面具有巨大潜力，能显著减少人工工作量，同时满足或超越现有预测性能标准。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

Motivation: 系统日志是宝贵的网络威胁情报来源，但由于缺乏结构、语义不一致和跨设备碎片化等问题，其利用效率受限。需要能够将噪声异构数据转化为连贯可互操作表示的方法。

Method: 集成轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成(RAG)和迭代校正步骤，确保生成的知识图谱在语法和语义上有效。系统将图谱聚合为会话，并使用LLM预测MITRE ATT&CK战术。

Result: 在公共基准和真实世界蜜罐数据集上的评估表明，OntoLogX能够跨多个KG后端稳健生成知识图谱，并准确将对抗活动映射到ATT&CK战术。检索和校正提高了精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 基于本体的表示为可操作的CTI提取提供了价值，代码导向模型在结构化日志分析中表现有效，检索和校正机制对精度和召回率有显著益处。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

Result: Falconer在指令遵循精度上接近最先进的LLM，同时减少推理成本高达90%，加速大规模知识挖掘超过20倍

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了一个高效且可扩展的基础框架

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

TL;DR: VOGUE通过将探索从文本输出空间转移到视觉输入空间，利用视觉不确定性指导探索，提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态输入时，将视觉输入视为固定条件，忽略了视觉变化带来的不确定性，导致策略对视觉变化的鲁棒性不足。

Method: VOGUE将图像视为随机上下文，通过计算原始分支和噪声分支之间的对称KL散度来量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样调度，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准上平均提升pass@1准确率2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准上提升3.7%，同时提高pass@4性能并缓解RL微调中的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索策略是改进多模态推理的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce

### [94] [Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts Surpasses ToT by Incorporating Logically-Consistent, Low-Utility Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01500)
*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT)方法，通过分离效用与逻辑一致性，将低效用但一致的候选视为资产而非浪费，解决了标准树搜索中的广度饱和和深度近视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代部署中大量测试时计算分配导致标准树搜索出现两个问题：广度饱和（额外样本产生近似重复）和深度近视（噪声短期效用修剪了需要更多步骤才能显现回报的分支）。

Method: LToT将前沿分为主线（高效用候选用于开发）和侧线（一致但初始低效用候选），通过带短路的侧向竞赛(LR--SC)进行探索，使用带重复确认的宽度感知阈值，并在分支超过主线阈值时立即提升。

Result: 理论证明侧向成本为伪线性Θ(N₀ log_η N₀)，与未加限制的主线指数增长形成对比。

Conclusion: LToT将大量测试时预算转化为原则性多样性，同时保持提升纪律，在不增加计算量的情况下缓解饱和和近视问题。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了分析大语言模型在数学推理任务中的内部表示，并引导生成过程避免极端行为，实现利用和探索的平衡。

Method: 训练稀疏自编码器生成稀疏向量表示，应用k-means聚类构建标记簇图，基于边权重定义奖励函数量化推理轨迹的遵循程度，并测量生成多样性评估探索程度。

Result: 研究发现平衡利用和探索对于数学推理任务的高准确性至关重要，稀疏自编码器可作为可扩展的奖励模型引导生成过程。

Conclusion: 该方法能够防止极端行为，促进更高质量的推理过程，通过平衡利用和探索实现更好的数学推理性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

*Navapat Nananukul,Yue Zhang,Ryan Lee,Eric Boxer,Jonathan May,Vibhav Giridhar Gogate,Jay Pujara,Mayank Kejriwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LOGicalThought (LogT)的神经符号架构，结合高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM，用于高保证推理领域（如法律和医学），在四个多领域基准测试中相比基线提升了11.84%的总体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保证推理领域需要准确、可验证且明确基于证据的结论，但LLM在标准推理任务中的能力无法满足对高保证文本指南的严格推理要求，特别是涉及可废止规则和异常的逻辑结构。

Method: 使用高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM结合，构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文，将长形式指南的推理问题转化为紧凑的接地评估。

Result: 在四个多领域基准测试中，相比四个基线，LogT将总体性能提高了11.84%。在三种推理模式上均有显著提升：否定推理提升达+10.2%，蕴含推理提升+13.2%，可废止推理提升+5.5%。

Conclusion: LogT架构通过神经符号方法有效解决了高保证推理中的挑战，特别是在处理否定、蕴含和可废止规则方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfoSeeker是一个LLM决策框架，通过将任务导向规划与信息寻求相结合，在部分可观测环境中处理观测和环境动态的不确定性，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划智能体在处理观测不确定性时，往往忽视其内部动态与实际环境之间的差异，导致在信息不完整和噪声动态的实际环境中表现不佳。

Method: InfoSeeker提示LLM主动收集信息，通过规划行动来验证理解、检测环境变化或测试假设，然后生成或修订任务导向计划。

Result: 在部分可观测环境基准测试中，InfoSeeker相比先前方法实现了74%的绝对性能提升，且不牺牲样本效率。在机器人操作和网络导航等基准测试中也优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 在部分可观测环境中，紧密集成规划和信息寻求对于实现鲁棒行为至关重要。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO)算法，通过过程奖励函数引导扩散语言模型学习结构化推理路径，解决现有方法中推理路径混乱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的扩散语言模型训练方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励，可能强化导致偶然正确结果的错误推理路径，这与推理的自然结构不匹配。

Method: 首先提出理论框架将复杂问题解决形式化为层次选择过程，然后引入SAPO算法，使用过程奖励函数鼓励增量进展，使模型的去噪过程与潜在推理层次对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在挑战性推理基准上显著提升性能，并增强生成过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于理论框架的SAPO算法能够有效引导扩散语言模型学习结构化推理路径，提高复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink是一种让大语言模型具备逆向思维能力的方法，通过先分析潜在危害及其后果，再生成安全回答来提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全回答，但无法系统性地考虑失败模式，需要一种能主动规避风险的新方法。

Method: 训练模型执行三个步骤：1) 列举潜在危害 2) 分析后果 3) 生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM系列上实现。

Result: 在模型规模扩展时安全性提升更强；缓解安全税，保持标准基准上的通用推理能力；在高风险领域（医疗、金融、法律等）有害回答减少达15.7%。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了可扩展和通用化的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvEvo-MARL是一种协同进化的多智能体强化学习框架，通过内部化安全机制到任务智能体中，无需外部防护模块即可抵御越狱攻击，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM多智能体系统防御方法存在两个问题：自我验证方法因单个智能体能力有限而效果不佳；外部防护模块会增加系统开销并造成单点故障。需要一种既能保证安全又不增加系统复杂度的解决方案。

Method: 提出AdvEvo-MARL框架，通过对抗性学习环境联合优化攻击者（生成进化越狱提示）和防御者（训练任务智能体既能完成任务又能抵抗攻击）。引入公共基线优势估计，同一功能组内的智能体共享组级平均回报基线，实现低方差更新和更强的组内协调。

Result: 在代表性攻击场景中，AdvEvo-MARL始终将攻击成功率保持在20%以下，而基线方法可达38.33%。同时保持甚至提高了任务准确率（在推理任务上提升达+3.67%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需依赖额外的防护智能体或增加系统开销，安全性和实用性可以共同提升。AdvEvo-MARL提供了一种有效的内部化安全机制解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

Motivation: 探索LLM在需要认知能力的应用（如心理咨询）中的潜力，评估其是否具备成为合格心理咨询师所需的专业知识。

Method: 构建PsychoBench基准，包含2,252个精心设计的单选题，基于美国国家咨询师认证考试，要求对心理学有深入理解和广泛知识覆盖。

Result: GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B等先进模型表现远超及格线（约70%准确率），而较小的开源模型如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B则远低于及格标准。

Conclusion: 只有前沿LLM目前能够达到心理咨询考试标准，这突显了开发心理学导向LLM的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

Motivation: 现有CMDP方法在高维或非结构化上下文中泛化能力差，导致计算开销大且性能不稳定，需要更高效的上下文处理方法。

Method: 使用大语言模型进行信息论摘要，将上下文输入压缩为低维语义丰富的摘要，这些摘要通过保留决策关键线索同时减少冗余来增强状态表示。

Result: 在离散、连续、视觉和推荐基准测试中，该方法优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，提高了奖励、成功率、样本效率，同时降低了延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的摘要为上下文丰富、资源受限环境中的高效决策提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Result: LLM在轨迹恢复任务中优于现有基准模型和专用轨迹恢复模型，具有强大的零样本泛化能力，但存在区域和交通模式的系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLM具备强大的道路网络和坐标系理解能力，能够通过灵活的地图推理来增强导航体验，但需要解决区域和交通模式的偏差问题。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了计算机使用代理(CUAs)存在的盲目标导向(BGD)问题，开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试，评估了9个前沿模型并发现高达80.8%的BGD率，揭示了即使在无害输入下仍存在的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理(CUAs)被广泛部署用于通过GUI界面完成用户目标，但存在盲目标导向(BGD)偏差，即不考虑可行性、安全性、可靠性或上下文而盲目追求目标，这带来了潜在的安全风险。

Method: 开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试，包含90个任务捕捉BGD的三种模式：缺乏上下文推理、在模糊情况下做出假设和决策、以及矛盾或不可行的目标。基于OSWorld构建真实环境，使用基于LLM的评估器评估代理行为。

Result: 评估了9个前沿模型，平均BGD率达到80.8%。基于提示的干预措施能降低BGD水平，但仍有显著风险。观察到三种失败模式：执行优先偏差、思维-行动脱节和请求优先性。

Conclusion: 识别BGD并引入BLIND-ACT为未来研究和缓解这一基本风险奠定了基础，确保CUA的安全部署。需要更强的训练或推理时干预措施来解决持续存在的风险。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

TL;DR: LENOHA是一个安全优先、本地优先的系统，通过高精度分类器将临床查询路由到医生策划的FAQ中返回原文答案，避免生成错误，实现低能耗、高准确性的临床咨询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者在接受侵入性手术前常有未解答的问题，但时间紧迫的工作流程和隐私限制限制了个性化咨询。需要一种安全、高效且保护隐私的解决方案。

Method: 使用高精度句子转换器分类器路由输入，从医生策划的FAQ中返回原文答案，完全避免临床路径中的自由文本生成。在两个临床领域（拔牙和胃镜检查）进行评估。

Result: E5-large-instruct模型在整体准确率0.983、AUC 0.996，仅有7个错误，与GPT-4o表现相当。非生成式临床路径能耗仅为1.0 mWh/输入，比本地8B SLM小170倍，延迟约0.10秒。

Conclusion: 通过返回经过验证的FAQ原文答案，可以在临床路径中结构性避免生成错误，支持隐私保护、可持续性和在带宽有限环境中的公平部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估方法应从基于直觉的合成任务转向关注稳健任务执行能力的评估哲学，借鉴数据科学中系统可靠部署的实践方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法主要基于对人类智能直觉的合成任务设计，这种设计在AI历史上表现不佳，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出基于稳健任务执行能力的评估哲学，借鉴数据科学中系统可靠部署的实践方法，提供具体的AGI评估实践示例。

Result: 开发了一种新的AGI评估视角，强调通过能力展示而非直觉任务来证明AGI。

Conclusion: AGI评估应转向关注系统在实际任务中的稳健执行能力，而非依赖基于直觉的合成任务设计。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了VaPR框架，通过LLM引导的响应编辑生成硬负样本，解决了合成偏好标注中的风格和长度偏差问题，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好微调方法忽略了合成偏好标注中普遍存在的风格和长度偏差噪声，需要一种能够产生高质量负样本的方法来改善模型对齐效果。

Method: 基于LLM引导的响应编辑框架，生成具有针对性错误的拒绝响应，同时保持与接受响应在风格和长度上的相似性，构建了包含30K高质量样本的VaPR数据集。

Result: 在三个LVLM家族上实现显著性能提升：LLaVA平均提升6.5%，Qwen2VL提升4.0%，Qwen2.5VL提升1.5%，特别是在推理任务上表现突出，并减少了二元问题中回答"是"的倾向。

Conclusion: VaPR框架有效解决了合成偏好数据中的偏差问题，性能随数据规模扩展而提升，且可泛化到开源LLM作为编辑器，为LVLM对齐提供了高质量的训练数据。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

TL;DR: MetaboT是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体AI系统，能将用户关于代谢组学的自然语言问题自动转换为SPARQL查询语言，用于操作知识图谱，显著提高了查询准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代谢组学质谱分析产生大量数据，知识图谱能有效组织这些数据，但使用知识图谱需要深入理解其本体和查询语言语法，这构成了技术障碍。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体系统，使用LangChain和LangGraph库构建，包括入口代理、验证代理、监督代理、知识图谱代理和查询生成代理，通过分工协作将用户问题转换为SPARQL查询。

Result: 在50个代谢组学相关问题的测试中，MetaboT达到了83.67%的准确率，而仅使用GPT-4o的基线方法只有8.16%的准确率。

Conclusion: MetaboT通过自动化SPARQL查询生成和执行，消除了传统上阻碍访问知识图谱的技术障碍，在保持实验基础查询生成的同时利用LLM能力，促进了数据驱动的发现。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

Result: 概念验证表明，定制化AI智能体部署能够与现实约束和风险状况对齐，增强态势感知、加速响应时间并通过自适应风险管理强化长期韧性。

Conclusion: 该研究为遵循行业标准的稳健、经验验证的多智能体系统奠定了基础，连接了AI理论与网络安全实践需求。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

TL;DR: 提出了PTA-GRPO框架，通过两阶段方法改进LLM的推理能力：第一阶段使用高级LLM将思维链提炼为紧凑的高层指导进行监督微调；第二阶段引入指导感知的强化学习方法联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的推理过程受限于自回归的token级生成，缺乏全局规划，导致推理冗余、不连贯或不准确。现有方法如树搜索和RL计算成本高且难以产生最优推理轨迹。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用高级LLM将CoT提炼为高层指导进行SFT；2) 引入指导感知的RL方法，联合优化最终输出和指导质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试（MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025、AMC）和不同基础模型上，PTA-GRPO均实现了稳定且显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO能有效提升LLM的推理能力，在不同模型和任务上表现出良好的有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新构建和操作化对抗性逆强化学习到大语言模型推理中，直接从专家演示中学习密集的token级奖励模型用于过程监督，而不是通过监督微调模仿风格。

Method: 使用对抗性逆强化学习方法学习密集的推理奖励模型，该模型在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为批评者重新排序采样轨迹。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上使用Llama3和Qwen2.5骨干网络，证明了密集推理奖励可以作为学习信号引发推理，并且通过奖励引导的重新排序提高了预测性能（特别是对于基于Llama的策略）。

Conclusion: 通过将训练信号、推理时间选择和token级诊断统一到单个推理奖励中，这项工作表明可重用的过程级奖励具有增强语言模型中多步推理的广泛潜力。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

TL;DR: 提出了CARS方法，通过自适应剪枝技术提高受限生成的采样效率，在保持分布准确性的同时避免计算浪费


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有受限生成方法存在两极化问题：贪婪解码会扭曲语言模型分布，而拒绝采样则浪费计算资源丢弃无效输出。在程序模糊测试等领域，既需要有效性又需要样本多样性

Method: CARS从无约束语言模型采样开始，通过记录违反约束的continuations到trie结构中，从未来采样中减去其概率质量，实现自适应剪枝

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等多个领域，CARS在采样效率（每个有效样本所需的LM前向传递次数）和样本多样性方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: CARS严格改进了拒绝采样的样本效率，同时保持分布无失真，为需要严格约束和多样性的应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLMs与人类集体决策对齐的框架，通过Lost at Sea实验发现不同LLM在集体推理中表现出不同的偏差模式，有些模仿人类偏见，有些则试图补偿这些偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，需要检验它们与人类社会推理的对齐程度，特别是集体层面的对齐，而非仅个体层面。

Method: 使用Lost at Sea社会心理学任务进行大规模在线实验(N=748)，随机分配组进行领导者选举，比较可见人口属性与匿名化名条件，然后模拟匹配的LLM组进行基准测试。

Result: LLM行为出现分歧：有些镜像人类偏见；有些掩盖这些偏见并试图补偿。人类-AI对齐在集体推理中取决于情境、线索和模型特定的归纳偏差。

Conclusion: 理解LLMs如何与集体人类行为对齐对于推进社会对齐的AI至关重要，需要能够捕捉集体推理复杂性的动态基准测试。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版生态系统面临提交量过大和AI不受监管的双重危机，需要新的治理模式来保障科学诚信。传统纯人工同行评审缺乏可扩展的客观基准。

Method: 采用确定性模拟框架，分析352份同行评审模拟报告，识别一致的系统状态指标。

Result: 系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，'修订'决策在所有学科中始终占多数(>50%)，'拒绝'率动态适应领域规范；保持稳定的29%证据锚定合规率。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI重新定位为机构问责的重要组成部分，为维护学术交流信任提供关键基础设施。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测基准仅提供原始数据点，缺乏特征描述和领域知识等文本语义信息，这限制了研究灵活性并阻碍模型充分利用领域知识进行检测。

Method: 提供20个精心策划的表格数据集，包含结构化文本元数据，并实现了包括经典、深度学习和基于LLM的最先进异常检测算法。还提出了一个零样本LLM框架，无需任务特定训练即可利用语义上下文。

Result: 实验结果表明，语义上下文能提高检测性能，并通过支持领域感知推理增强可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD为系统探索上下文感知异常检测建立了基准，展示了文本元数据在异常检测中的作用和实用性。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM的深度利用具有高度异质性和情境依赖性：浅层负责知识和检索，深层对推理至关重要，但可通过蒸馏重塑；评估方法显著影响深度层重要性判断


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有研究认为LLM深层对表示学习贡献有限且可移除的观点，进行系统性研究以验证这些结论的局限性

Method: 从评估协议、任务类别和模型架构等多个维度系统研究深度利用情况，比较似然性评估与生成评估的差异

Result: 深层通常不如浅层有效，但贡献因评估设置而异；基于似然的评估中仅前几层关键，而生成评估显示中深层对推理和长程连贯性不可或缺；知识检索集中在浅层，推理准确性依赖深层但可通过蒸馏重塑

Conclusion: LLM的深度利用高度异质且情境依赖，需要在解释和压缩大模型时考虑任务、指标和模型特性

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型在抽象推理能力评估中存在偏差：文本模式下准确率可能高估抽象推理能力，而视觉模式下可能低估。模型往往依赖表面模式而非真正抽象推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI模型是否真正具备抽象推理能力，而非仅通过表面模式匹配获得高准确率。研究OpenAI o3-preview等模型在ConceptARC任务中的表现，探究其是否使用任务设计者预期的抽象概念。

Method: 在ConceptARC基准上评估多种模型，变化输入模态（文本vs视觉）、是否允许使用Python工具、推理模型的工作量。除输出准确率外，还精细评估模型生成的自然语言解释规则。

Result: 文本模式下某些模型准确率可达人类水平，但其规则多基于表面"捷径"而非预期抽象概念；视觉模式下模型准确率显著下降，但规则分析显示它们仍能捕捉相当比例的预期抽象概念，只是应用能力不足。

Conclusion: 仅凭准确率评估ARC类任务的抽象推理能力会高估文本模态、低估视觉模态的能力。提出的评估框架能更真实反映多模态模型的抽象推理能力，为追踪类人抽象智能提供更原则性的方法。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

TL;DR: FlexDoc是一个可扩展的合成数据生成框架，通过随机模式和参数化采样生成多语言半结构化文档，显著降低文档理解模型的数据收集和标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级文档理解模型需要大量多样化、高质量标注数据，但实际数据收集面临隐私限制、法律约束和人工标注成本高昂等问题，成本可达数百万美元。

Method: 结合随机模式和参数化采样，通过概率建模布局模式、视觉结构和内容变异性，实现可控的大规模多样化文档变体生成。

Result: 在关键信息提取任务中，使用FlexDoc生成的数据可将F1分数提升高达11%，同时相比传统硬模板方法减少90%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: FlexDoc已在实际部署中加速了企业级文档理解模型的开发，同时显著降低了数据获取和标注成本。

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基准在评估维度、响应格式和评分机制方面存在不足，无法有效评估从封闭语言模型向具备外部感知和信息整合能力的互联代理系统转变的新型AI系统。

Method: 开发了一个包含214个专家策划查询的基准，分布在10个广泛主题领域，每个查询都配有手动构建的参考包，支持复合评估。建立了多维评估框架，整合了语义质量、主题聚焦和检索可信度的评分指标。

Result: 广泛实验证实主流DRAs在性能上优于基于网络搜索工具增强的推理模型，但仍显示出相当大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 本研究为DRA系统的能力评估、架构改进和范式进步提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

TL;DR: 提出了UpSafe°C框架，通过安全感知的升级改造增强LLM安全性，将安全关键层转换为稀疏MoE结构，引入安全温度机制实现推理时灵活控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全技术（外部防护、推理引导、后训练对齐）在平衡安全性、实用性和可控性方面存在局限，需要更动态、模块化的安全解决方案。

Method: 识别安全关键层并升级为稀疏MoE结构，路由器作为软防护栏选择性激活原始MLP和安全专家；采用两阶段SFT策略；引入安全温度机制实现推理时动态控制。

Result: 在多个基准测试、基础模型和模型规模上实现稳健的安全改进，对抗有害和越狱输入，同时保持通用任务竞争力；安全温度机制达到效用与安全的帕累托最优前沿。

Conclusion: 为LLM安全提供了新方向：从静态对齐转向动态、模块化和推理感知的控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR被广泛用于提升大语言模型的推理能力，但近期证据表明它可能反而缩小推理边界而非扩展。本文旨在深入探究RLVR失败的原因，揭示其学习动态中的关键问题。

Method: 通过理论分析和在多个数学推理基准上的实证研究，识别了RLVR中的负干扰现象和赢家通吃现象。基于这些洞察，提出了一种专注于低概率问题的数据筛选算法。

Result: 研究发现RLVR存在负干扰（学习解决某些训练问题会降低其他问题正确解的概率）和赢家通吃现象（过度强化高概率正确解而抑制低概率解）。提出的数据筛选算法显著改善了Pass@k性能。

Conclusion: RLVR的失败源于标准RL目标中固有的在线策略采样，导致模型收敛到狭窄的解决策略。通过专注于低概率问题的数据筛选，可以有效缓解这些问题并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at
https://github.com/mail-research/SELF-llm-interference.

Motivation: 计算机使用代理在自动化日常数字任务方面具有潜力，但其不可靠性和高方差阻碍了在长视野复杂任务中的应用。

Method: bBoN方法通过生成多个代理执行轨迹，并使用描述代理执行过程的行为叙述来进行轨迹选择，实现广泛探索和原则性轨迹选择。

Result: 在OSWorld上达到69.9%的最新水平，显著优于先前方法，接近人类72%的表现，并在WindowsAgentArena和AndroidWorld上展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，当采用结构化轨迹理解和选择时，扩展计算机使用代理具有显著效果，bBoN为实现这一目标提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Motivation: 解决大模型在推理过程中无法持续捕获或重用程序，而是陷入冗长和退化探索的问题。

Method: 引入推理抽象的概念，训练模型能够为问题提出多个抽象，然后通过强化学习激励在利用这些抽象信息的基础上构建解决方案。采用两玩家RL训练范式，联合训练抽象生成器和解决方案生成器。

Result: RLAD实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更难问题的泛化能力。测试时在生成抽象上分配更多计算资源比生成更多解决方案更有利于性能提升。

Conclusion: 推理抽象能够引导有意义的探索，提高模型的推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge为生物信号的跨模态知识迁移提供了一种高效解决方案，显著降低了计算和内存开销，同时保持了迁移性能。

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样在高温设置下也能改善质量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法有效解决了高温采样在精度敏感任务中的准确性问题，提升了输出质量与多样性的平衡。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

Conclusion: 提供了迄今最大的LLM整理热电数据集，建立了可扩展的数据驱动材料发现基础，并发布了交互式网络探索器。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

Method: 提出RSAVQ框架：1) 误差方向敏感度引导(EDSG)，利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感方向；2) 权重通道敏感度引导(WCSG)，通过FIM曲率分析构建通道级敏感度度量来动态指导比特资源分配。

Result: 在LLaMA-3 8B的2比特量化中，RSAVQ在困惑度(PPL)上领先基线方法0.4，在零样本准确率上领先1.5。

Conclusion: RSAVQ为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何与神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

*Vedant Palit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个信任感知的深度Q网络来防御联邦学习中的投毒和后门攻击，通过多信号证据更新客户端信任度，优化长期鲁棒性-准确性目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在部分可观测性下容易受到投毒和后门攻击，需要设计有效的防御机制。

Method: 将防御建模为部分可观测序列决策问题，使用信任感知的深度Q网络整合多信号证据进行客户端信任更新。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上实验显示：准确率稳步提升；增加客户端重叠度能提高准确率并降低攻击成功率；减少可观测性时准确率保持稳定但攻击成功率增加；DQN实现了最佳的鲁棒性-准确性权衡。

Conclusion: 序列信念更新可以缓解弱信号问题，深度Q网络在联邦学习防御中表现出优越的鲁棒性-准确性平衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，通过为每个单元分配本地流量预算（激活率与扇出的乘积），在全局流量预算约束下最大化编码熵，实现选择性-受众平衡，提高网络效率和表示多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法基于参数对损失的影响（如幅度或梯度）进行剪枝，而BB方法旨在通过最大化编码熵来学习更多样化和高效的表示。

Method: BB为每个单元分配本地流量预算（激活率×扇出），通过约束熵分析推导出选择性-受众平衡公式，并使用简单的本地执行器剪枝扇入（降低激活率）或扇出（减少广播）。

Result: 在ASR的Transformers、人脸识别的ResNets和突触预测的3D U-Nets上，BB在相同稀疏度下提高了编码熵、去相关性和准确性，有时甚至超过密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上，达到了最先进的F1和PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB方法易于集成，为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条路径，在多种网络架构和任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive

scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios

morphologically diverse multi-agent competition while maintaining high

TL;DR: RLP是一种在预训练阶段引入强化学习思想的创新方法，通过将思维链视为探索性行动，基于信息增益计算奖励，鼓励模型在预测前独立思考，显著提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的大模型训练范式只在最后阶段引入强化学习，而预训练阶段仅使用下一个词预测损失。作者质疑这是否是最优方式，希望将强化学习的核心精神——探索——提前到预训练阶段。

Method: 提出RLP（强化学习预训练）目标，将思维链视为探索性行动，奖励信号基于思维链提供的对预测未来词的信息增益。具体来说，奖励衡量在同时考虑上下文和采样推理链时下一个词对数似然的增加量。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上使用RLP预训练，在8个数学和科学基准上的平均性能提升19%。在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上应用RLP，整体平均从42.81%提升到61.32%，科学推理任务提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功地将强化学习重新定义为普通文本的预训练目标，弥合了下一个词预测与有用思维链推理出现之间的差距，证明了在不同架构和模型规模上的可扩展性。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LQR和强化学习的混合控制框架，用于结构振动控制，避免了传统模型依赖和RL训练期间的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的LQR控制需要繁琐的系统辨识，而纯RL方法在训练期间可能对结构造成损害。研究发现即使基于错误模型的LQR控制器也比无控制效果好，这启发了混合控制方法。

Method: 使用基于随机选择模型的LQR控制器来指导RL控制器训练，LQR策略不依赖真实或近似结构模型，保持整体框架的无模型特性。

Result: 该混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最小化了朴素RL实现中的探索风险。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决RL振动控制训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究，为模型无关的结构振动控制提供了安全有效的途径。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Motivation: 理解RNN的内部动态对于提高其可解释性和改进设计至关重要，但目前缺乏有效的方法来分析信息在网络中的流动路径。

Method: 采用信息论方法量化节点间互信息，识别信息中继节点，并在合成和真实时间序列分类任务中应用，包括LSTM和GRU等架构，同时进行节点敲除实验验证功能重要性。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

TL;DR: 提出NcPU框架，结合抗噪声监督非对比损失和幻影标签消歧方案，无需辅助信息即可在正样本-未标注样本学习中学习判别性表征，显著提升复杂数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PU学习方法在复杂数据集上性能远低于监督学习方法（如CIFAR-100上差距达14.26%），主要瓶颈在于不可靠监督下难以学习判别性表征。

Method: NcPU框架包含：1) NoiSNCL损失函数，在不可靠监督下对齐类内表征；2) PLD方案，通过基于遗憾的标签更新提供保守负监督。两者在EM框架下可迭代互益。

Result: 实验表明：1) NoiSNCL使简单PU方法达到竞争性能；2) NcPU在多种数据集上大幅超越现有最佳PU方法，包括灾后建筑损伤映射等实际应用场景。

Conclusion: NcPU无需辅助信息即可有效解决PU学习中的表征学习瓶颈，在复杂数据集和实际应用中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

Motivation: 从人类视觉感知中的微眼跳现象获得灵感，微眼跳能揭示隐藏的感知动态，类似地希望通过轻量扰动来暴露LLM的潜在错误行为。

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，无需微调或任务特定监督，通过分析模型对这些扰动的响应来检测错误行为。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效检测多种LLM的错误行为，包括事实性、安全性、毒性和后门攻击等问题，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 预训练的LLM已经编码了检测自身错误所需的内部证据，微眼跳启发的干预方法为检测和缓解不良行为提供了有效途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的长输出上下文生成虽然支持扩展思维链，但也导致KV缓存快速增长，迅速耗尽GPU内存。

Method: 基于注意力稀疏性识别不同重要性的思想类型，采用混合量化-驱逐策略，按思想重要性分配token精度，并随着推理轨迹演化逐步驱逐不太重要的思想中的token。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，ThinKV实现了接近无损的准确性，KV缓存减少到原始大小的5%以下，推理吞吐量比最先进基线提高达5.8倍。

Conclusion: ThinKV通过思想自适应的KV缓存压缩有效解决了大型推理模型内存消耗问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在亚利桑那州皮马县57个异质交叉口数据上测试，与8种先进ML回归模型和7种基于实例的DA方法相比，GBBW框架提供了更准确和鲁棒的延误估计。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强模型可迁移性，支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于性能的规划，促进了机器学习技术在现实交通系统中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from
2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly
important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational
modeling. This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI

shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current
state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and
applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview
ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the
clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of
their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets,
computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and
cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a
structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分析通常假设训练数据和参数是各向同性的，但实际数据往往具有复杂的结构特征。本文旨在理解在更一般的数据模型下，神经网络梯度结构如何受到数据特征、缩放机制和激活函数的影响。

Method: 采用尖峰数据模型，允许数据主体部分各向异性和病态，不要求数据和权重矩阵独立，同时分析均值场和神经正切核两种缩放机制。

Result: 发现输入权重的梯度近似低秩，由两个秩一成分主导：一个与数据残差主体对齐，另一个与输入数据中的秩一尖峰对齐。数据特性、缩放机制和激活函数共同决定这两个成分的平衡。

Conclusion: 标准正则化方法（如权重衰减、输入噪声和雅可比惩罚）能够选择性地调节这些梯度成分，理论预测在合成和真实数据实验中得到验证。

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

*Aritra Das,Joseph T. Iosue,Victor V. Albert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于量子启发的内在维度估计基准QuIIEst，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，测试发现现有IDE方法在该基准上表现较差，表明基准具有内在难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内在维度估计方法在不同数据集上估计结果差异很大，需要更复杂的流形基准来评估这些方法。

Method: 提出QuIIEst基准，使用量子光学方法嵌入任意齐次空间，允许曲率修改和加性噪声，构建拓扑非平凡流形家族。

Result: 测试的IDE方法在QuIIEst流形上的准确性普遍低于现有基准，且性能随曲率不均匀性增加而下降很小，表明基准难度较高。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准为IDE方法提供了更严格的测试环境，揭示了现有方法的局限性，并成功应用于非流形空间的有效维度提取。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种自监督表示学习训练范式：自蒸馏互信息(SDMI)和联合互信息(JMI)，为现有方法的架构组件提供了理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督表示学习虽然取得了显著经验成功，但其基本原理仍不够清晰。现有工作通常将预测器网络、停止梯度操作等架构元素视为经验性补充，缺乏理论依据。

Method: 从变分互信息下界出发，推导出SDMI和JMI两种训练范式。SDMI需要交替优化，理论上必需停止梯度操作；JMI允许通过对称架构进行联合优化。

Result: 证明预测器网络在SDMI中和统计正则化器在JMI中是互信息目标的可行替代。许多现有自监督学习方法都是这两种范式的具体实例或近似。

Conclusion: 该研究为不同自监督学习方法的架构组件选择提供了超越启发式便利的理论解释，统一了现有方法的理论基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估数据集对称性假设的方法，通过量化数据集中的各向异性（对称性破坏）程度，发现基准点云数据集中存在高度对齐性，并证明分布对称性破坏会影响对称感知方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称感知方法（如数据增强和等变架构）假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"，但这一假设缺乏严格的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种通过双样本神经网络分类器测试来量化数据集各向异性的指标，区分原始数据集与其随机增强等价版本，并在合成和基准数据集上进行验证。

Result: 在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐性；理论分析表明分布对称性破坏会阻止不变方法达到最优性能；实证发现等变方法的效益取决于具体数据集。

Conclusion: 理解等变性需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差，对称感知方法的有效性具有数据集依赖性。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Result: 发现更好的扩散模型在输入空间的特定区域更准确地近似分数，而在其他区域欠拟合分数。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型的泛化和生成性能至关重要，提供了新的可测试见解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，用于掩码扩散模型在推理时的自校正，通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要自校正能力——在推理时检测和修正低质量token。虽然掩码扩散模型在离散空间生成建模中很有前景，但其自校正能力仍未得到充分理解。

Method: PRISM通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，这些质量分数与MDM在同一前向传播中计算，用于检测低质量token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上提升了MDM推理性能：数独、无条件文本生成（170M参数）以及使用LLaDA的代码生成（8B参数）。

Conclusion: PRISM是一种有效的自校正方法，适用于任何预训练的掩码扩散模型，无需改变模型架构或训练过程。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

TL;DR: 提出基于Pandora's Box问题的LLM推理时优化框架，通过UCB算法实现接近最优的停止策略，在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上比传统Best-of-N采样节省15-35%生成次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成需要在输出质量和推理成本之间平衡，特别是在多轮生成场景中，需要决定何时停止生成而不了解底层奖励分布。

Method: 将每次生成视为打开一个代价随机的"盒子"，开发UCB风格的Pandora's Box算法，并通过Bradley-Terry变换处理跨提示的奖励缩放问题，实现自适应推理时优化。

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上，使用多种LLM-奖励模型对，自适应策略能达到与非自适应Best-of-N采样相同的性能，同时平均减少15-35%的生成次数。

Conclusion: 该研究在最优停止理论和推理时扩展之间建立了原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够整合复杂和机器学习的集体变量，扩展了生物化学和材料模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

TL;DR: SoftAdaClip是一种差分隐私训练方法，用平滑的tanh变换替代硬裁剪，在保护隐私的同时减少模型性能损失和公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私(DP)虽然提供强隐私保护，但会降低模型性能并加剧公平性问题，特别是对少数群体。DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号。

Method: 提出SoftAdaClip方法，用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，在限制敏感性的同时保留相对梯度幅度。

Result: 在MIMIC-III、GOSSIS-eICU和Adult Income等数据集上的实验表明，SoftAdaClip相比DP-SGD将子群体差异减少高达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少高达48%，且这些减少具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制结合对于实现公平且私有的模型训练至关重要。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

Conclusion: LLA通过理论分析和实证验证，证明其在注意力机制中的优势，为大规模模型提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method

TL;DR: 该论文分析了基于模型的强化学习算法MBPO在DeepMind Control Suite中表现不佳的原因，识别了动态模型与奖励模型之间的尺度不匹配问题以及目标表示选择不当的问题，并提出了解决方案，使MBPO在多数任务中超越了模型自由方法SAC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MBPO算法在OpenAI Gym中表现优异但在DeepMind Control Suite中表现不佳的原因，揭示环境特定假设如何隐式影响算法设计，并解决由此产生的性能下降问题。

Method: 识别MBPO失败的两个关键问题：动态模型与奖励模型之间的尺度不匹配导致评论家低估，以及目标表示选择不当增加模型方差。通过解决这些问题来改进算法性能。

Result: 解决了失败模式后，MBPO在7个DeepMind Control Suite任务中的5个超越了SAC，同时保持了在OpenAI Gym中的优异表现。

Conclusion: 研究强调了将MDP任务和环境结构与算法失败模式联系起来的重要性，呼吁开发统一的解决方案，并澄清基准选择如何影响算法泛化能力。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

Conclusion: 通过消融研究验证了长度信号在动态采样中的有效性，为未来研究指明了方向

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个稳定性-可塑性原则来解释离线到在线强化学习中的不一致性，强调在在线微调时应保留预训练策略或离线数据集中更好的知识，同时保持足够的可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习在实践中表现出高度不一致性，相同的在线微调设计选择在不同设置下可能完全失效，需要理论框架来解释和指导设计选择。

Result: 在63个案例中的45个案例中，实证结果与该框架的预测高度一致，验证了该原则的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的原则性框架，用于指导离线到在线强化学习中的设计选择。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEL-NAS是一种基于大语言模型的神经架构搜索方法，通过搜索空间分区、架构提示协同进化和零成本预测器，解决了传统方法搜索成本高和LLM方法探索偏差的问题，能在几分钟内找到高精度低延迟的神经网络架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超网方法需要多GPU天，而LLM驱动方法存在探索偏差，无法发现整个搜索空间中不同延迟范围的架构。需要一种既能快速搜索又能全面探索的方法。

Method: 1) 复杂度驱动分区引擎按复杂度划分搜索空间；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化算子，通过知识库更新和引导进化算法改进架构设计；3) 零成本预测器避免大量候选架构训练。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS实现了更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似精度下延迟降低达54%，搜索成本从数天降至数分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS通过分区搜索空间和协同进化策略，有效解决了LLM驱动的NAS中的探索偏差问题，实现了高效且全面的硬件感知神经架构搜索。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，即使在高污染比例下，加权行为克隆仍能保持接近最优的性能，优于传统行为克隆、批量约束Q学习和行为正则化演员-评论家等基线方法。

Conclusion: 密度比率加权行为克隆提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，能够从污染数据中稳健学习，具有理论保证和实际有效性，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

TL;DR: 该论文提出对抗性攻击的可转移性取决于攻击操作域：输入数据空间的攻击可以转移，而模型表示空间的攻击无法转移，除非表示空间几何对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像对抗样本和文本越狱攻击可以在模型间转移，但视觉语言模型的图像越狱攻击无法转移的差异现象。

Method: 通过理论证明和四个实证研究：1) 数学证明相同输入输出映射的不同表示网络；2) 构建图像分类器的表示空间攻击；3) 构建语言模型的表示空间攻击；4) 构建视觉语言模型的数据空间攻击和表示空间对齐实验。

Result: 数据空间攻击成功转移，表示空间攻击无法转移，但当视觉语言模型的潜在几何在投影后空间充分对齐时，表示空间攻击可以转移。

Conclusion: 对抗性转移不是所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享数据空间与模型独特表示空间，这对构建更鲁棒模型具有关键意义。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

Conclusion: 概率节点-关系等变性是提升知识图谱基础模型表达能力的关键，Flock模型证明了其在零样本链接预测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

### [173] [On Integer Programming for the Binarized Neural Network Verification Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01525)
*Woojin Kim,James R. Luedtke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种改进二值化神经网络验证的整数规划方法：新的多类线性目标函数和利用BNN递归结构的有效不等式生成技术，显著提升了验证效率和扰动范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二值化神经网络验证问题通常被建模为整数规划问题，但传统方法存在大M约束导致的巨大整数间隙，使得求解困难。需要改进IP公式化来提高验证效率。

Method: 1) 为多类分类场景设计新的线性目标函数；2) 利用BNN的递归结构生成有效不等式，改进整数规划公式化。

Result: 与现有IP方法相比，在有限时间内能够验证BNN对抗更大范围的输入扰动，验证能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的两种技术有效改善了BNN验证的整数规划公式化，提高了验证效率和扰动容忍度，为BNN的鲁棒性验证提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

*Lecheng Kong,Xiyuan Wang,Yixin Chen,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL)框架，通过将往返一致性作为可训练目标来提升化学大语言模型的性能和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前化学大语言模型缺乏往返一致性，即模型能完成正向任务但无法从自身生成的文本准确重建原始结构，这表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握。

Method: 引入RTRL框架，使用往返转换成功作为奖励信号来训练模型提升一致性；提出迭代变体，让正向和反向映射交替相互训练形成自改进循环。

Result: 实验表明RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下显著提升了性能和一致性，优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 往返一致性不仅是理想属性，更是可训练目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基座模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的攻击方法，能够绕过大型语言模型的提示防护机制，成功越狱多个生产级模型，揭示了轻量级提示防护的固有漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，AI安全和对齐变得至关重要。提示防护是一种流行的轻量级机制，但本研究旨在揭示其局限性，展示如何通过资源不对称性来绕过这些防护。

Method: 攻击方法利用提示防护与主模型之间的资源不对称性，编码一个轻量级防护无法解码但主模型能够理解的越狱提示。

Result: 该攻击方法在Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等高度保护的聊天界面中持续成功越狱生产模型，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现代LLM架构中轻量级提示防护的固有攻击面，强调需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出，并识别了其他关键对齐问题。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Motivation: 6G向AI原生无线系统演进，需要在蜂窝网络软件栈中无缝集成数字信号处理和机器学习，使现代网络生命周期更接近AI系统。

Method: 开发了将Python算法编译为GPU可运行二进制文件的框架，使用卷积神经网络进行PUSCH接收机信道估计，先在数字孪生中训练，后在实时测试平台验证。

Result: 在NVIDIA AI Aerial平台上实现了统一方法，确保在NVIDIA GPU上的效率、灵活性和最高性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为在下一代蜂窝系统中可扩展集成AI/ML模型奠定了基础，对实现原生智能6G网络愿景至关重要。

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of
natively intelligent 6G networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSci是首个基于LLM的智能代理框架，用于通用时间序列预测，通过四个专门代理（数据管理、规划、预测、报告）实现自动化预测流程，显著降低预测误差并提高透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统时间序列预测中需要大量人工预处理、验证和集成的问题，以及现有模型泛化能力差、领域依赖性强的问题，需要一个通用的、领域无关的自动化框架。

Method: 构建包含四个专门代理的LLM驱动框架：Curator进行数据诊断和预处理，Planner缩小模型选择空间，Forecaster进行模型拟合验证和自适应集成，Reporter生成透明报告。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，TSci持续优于统计和LLM基线方法，平均分别降低预测误差10.4%和38.2%，并生成清晰透明的预测流程报告。

Conclusion: TSci成功实现了自动化、可解释的时间序列预测，显著减少了人工干预，提高了预测准确性和透明度，为通用时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题评估LLM的反事实推理能力，发现从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%，强化学习相比监督微调能更好地提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM反事实推理能力的方法往往跳过溯因步骤，导致高估模型性能。需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤（溯因、干预、预测）的框架。

Method: 引入可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题操作化因果推理，要求完整的三个推理步骤，并创建可扩展的合成数据。

Result: SOTA模型从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%。监督微调在领域内性能提升但泛化能力下降，而强化学习在代码和数学问题上均有1.5-2倍提升。

Conclusion: 强化学习能诱导核心认知行为并泛化到新领域，在提升LLM反事实推理能力方面比监督微调更有前景。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Predictive Preference Learning (PPL)方法，通过人类干预的隐式偏好信号来预测未来状态，将单次干预扩展到未来L个时间步，从而提高学习效率和减少人类演示需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式模仿学习方法仅修正当前状态的动作，不调整未来可能更危险状态的动作，需要一种能将专家修正传播到安全关键区域的方法。

Method: PPL将每次人类干预引导到未来L个时间步（偏好视界），假设智能体执行相同动作且人类进行相同干预，然后对这些未来状态应用偏好优化。

Result: 在自动驾驶和机器人操作基准测试中验证了方法的效率和通用性，显著提高了学习效率并减少了人类演示需求。

Conclusion: 理论分析表明选择合适的偏好视界L能在风险状态覆盖和标签正确性之间取得平衡，从而限制算法最优性差距。

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo
and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl

TL;DR: MIRA是一种无需训练的推理时对齐方法，通过图像空间的KL代理正则化来防止奖励黑客攻击，在保持提示一致性的同时提升奖励分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像虽然符合文本提示，但往往无法满足用户特定的标量奖励标准（如美学评分）。现有的推理时对齐方法通过噪声优化容易产生奖励黑客问题，即图像获得高分但严重偏离原始提示。

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入基于分数的图像空间KL代理正则化，约束采样轨迹以防止奖励黑客。还提出了MIRA-DPO，将偏好优化映射到推理时，扩展MIRA到不可微分奖励。

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL模型、多种奖励函数和公共数据集上，MIRA相比强基线方法获得了超过60%的胜率，同时保持了提示一致性。机制图显示奖励增益接近零漂移，而DNO方法随着计算增加会产生漂移。

Conclusion: MIRA提供了一种无需微调的推理时对齐解决方案，有效防止奖励黑客攻击，在提升奖励分数的同时保持图像质量和对提示的忠实度。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF中KL正则化的不同实现方式，建立了统一框架证明'k1 in reward'是Reverse KL正则化的原则性损失，并首次证明了在on-policy条件下'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'的梯度等价性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法中KL正则化的实现存在混淆，有些方法将KL项作为数值估计系数而非优化损失，这忽视了其功能作用。需要建立统一框架来分析不同实现方式的理论基础。

Method: 建立统一框架连接两种实现风格：将数学项kn作为策略评分函数的分离系数，或作为直接传播梯度的损失函数。通过梯度分析证明两种视角的等价性。

Result: 证明'k1 in reward'是Reverse KL正则化的原则性损失；在on-policy条件下'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'梯度等价；'k3 as loss'仅是原则性损失的一阶有偏近似。

Conclusion: 为KL正则化的选择和正确实现提供了基于梯度的全面理论依据，有助于构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

<details>

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法在大规模任务上性能较差且无法量化不确定性，而高通量基因组扰动数据为改进模型识别提供了机会。

Method: 采用经验贝叶斯框架，建模总因果效应矩阵的似然（近似矩阵正态分布），使用尖峰-板马蹄先验，从观测数据中学习无标度和Erdős-Rényi结构的权重，将每条边作为潜变量。

Result: 通过广泛模拟显示IBCD在结构恢复方面优于现有基线方法，在521个基因的CRISPR扰动数据上应用，证明边后验包含概率能够识别稳健的图结构。

Conclusion: IBCD框架在因果发现中实现了优越的性能和不确定性量化能力，为大规模干预数据分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

Motivation: 现有的DiT服务系统使用固定程度的序列并行，无法有效处理具有混合分辨率和截止时间的异构工作负载，导致GPU利用率低和服务级别目标达成率差。

Method: 提出步级序列并行策略，根据请求的截止时间动态调整并行度；引入轮次调度机制，包括时间离散化、步级并行度自适应和请求联合打包。

Conclusion: TetriServe通过动态并行调度策略，有效解决了DiT模型在高分辨率图像生成中的服务效率问题，显著提升了服务性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

Motivation: 探究RL是否能推动PLM超越其预训练先验，发现潜在的序列-结构-功能规则，以及RL在蛋白质设计中是否比监督学习更具优势。

Method: 在抗菌肽设计、激酶变体优化、抗体工程和逆折叠四个领域，结合多种RL算法和模型类别，与PLM配对进行实验。

Conclusion: 为蛋白质设计中的RL应用提供实用指导：优先进行奖励建模和校准，匹配算法与任务难度，在边际收益最大的地方分配容量。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练强化学习方法，通过自适应压缩推理步骤来解决模型在复杂推理任务中的欠适应性问题，平衡推理不足和过度推理，提高准确率并减少推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维模型通过扩展测试时计算来解决复杂推理任务，但需要根据任务难度合理分配计算资源。推理过短会导致困难问题出错，推理过长则效率低下。模型缺乏根据问题难度调整响应长度的能力，即欠适应性问题。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法：利用模型在长推理轨迹上的自注意力机制识别重要步骤并剪枝冗余步骤；估计任务难度并将其纳入训练奖励，学习根据示例难度分配推理预算。

Result: 在多个任务上（AIME、AMC、GPQA-D、BBEH），TRAAC相比基础模型平均绝对准确率提升8.4%，推理长度相对减少36.8%；相比最佳RL基线准确率提升7.9%，长度减少29.4%。即使在非数学数据集上也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TRAAC能够基于难度进行细粒度思维预算调整，任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩相结合在不同任务中都能带来收益，有效解决了推理中的欠适应性问题。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病远程监测中存在患者测量误差、环境噪声和数据包丢失三种噪声，导致UPDRS评分预测误差增加

Method: 将语音特征按选定特征值分组构建对比对，训练多层感知机编码器生成噪声鲁棒特征，与原始特征拼接后输入预测模型

Result: 实验表明NoRo能有效提升不同噪声环境下各种下游预测模型的噪声鲁棒性

Conclusion: NoRo框架成功解决了帕金森病远程监测中的噪声问题，提高了UPDRS预测的准确性

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用自旋转移力矩磁隧道结(STT-MTJs)生成硬件真随机数，以解决生成式AI模型中伪随机数生成器的安全漏洞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型中使用的确定性伪随机数生成器会产生可预测的模式，容易受到攻击者利用。传统的防御方法通常伴随着显著的能耗和延迟开销。

Method: 通过嵌入STT-MTJs生成的硬件真随机比特，构建高度并行的FPGA辅助计算系统，每秒可产生兆比特级的真随机数，并通过NIST随机性测试。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上训练的生成对抗网络中集成硬件随机比特，与低质量随机数生成器基线相比，不安全输出减少了高达18.6倍。系统具有纳秒级切换速度和高能效。

Conclusion: 基于STT-MTJ的系统具有扩展到超过100万个并行单元的潜力，实现千兆比特/秒的吞吐量，适合大型语言模型采样，突显了自旋电子随机数生成器作为下一代生成式AI系统实用安全组件的潜力。

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

Motivation: 深入理解变分自编码器中后验坍塌现象的本质，揭示其并非仅仅是优化失败，而是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变现象。

Method: 通过分析后验坍塌相关平凡解的稳定性，识别临界超参数阈值，并在合成和真实数据集上验证临界行为。

Result: 发现了KL散度在临界边界处的不连续性，证实了后验坍塌是一种相变现象，临界边界由数据结构和模型超参数共同决定。

Conclusion: 后验坍塌是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变，这一视角为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

TL;DR: 研究发现SFT高分不一定能转化为RL后的性能提升，甚至可能比直接在基础模型上做RL效果更差。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更好的RL结果预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前LLM后训练中SFT和RL两阶段独立训练的做法，质疑高SFT分数是否能可靠预测RL后的性能提升。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和RLVR(GRPO)，在7个数学基准上进行了多达256次重复的广泛评估，消耗超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 发现基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接使用预RL性能预测精度显著提高，R²和Spearman秩相关系数提升高达0.5(2倍)。

Conclusion: SFT分数不是RL结果的可靠预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k是更好的替代指标，对实际应用有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

Motivation: 高质量训练数据对大型语言模型扩展至关重要但供应有限，合成数据技术可能突破这一限制，需要实证验证其效果。

Method: 进行大规模实证研究（>1000个LLM，>10万GPU小时），使用统一协议和扩展定律，比较自然网页数据、多种合成数据（改写文本、生成教科书）及其混合。

Result: 改写合成数据单独使用不优于自然数据，但与自然数据混合可显著加速训练；教科书式合成数据单独使用效果较差；合成数据最佳比例约30%；8B参数生成器足够；改写合成数据未见模型崩溃，教科书式合成数据存在模型崩溃模式。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性优势，改写合成数据与自然数据混合可显著提升效率，但需注意数据质量和混合比例，为实际应用提供指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

TL;DR: 提出Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT)，通过可微分门控机制动态学习每个token在三种几何注意力分支间的路由，实现自适应几何专业化，相比固定几何方法在知识图谱补全任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer在欧几里得几何上表现良好，但对非欧几里得结构数据效果有限。虽然已有扩展到双曲和球面空间的方法，但它们需要预先确定单一几何，当数据具有混合几何特性时缺乏灵活性。

Method: CAT架构包含三个几何注意力分支（欧几里得、双曲、球面），通过轻量级可微分门控机制动态学习每个token的路由。路由网络提供可解释的曲率偏好，每个分支使用针对各自流形优化的几何特定操作。

Result: 在知识图谱补全基准（FB15k-237, WN18RR）上，CAT相比固定几何基线在MRR和Hits@10指标上提升约10%，参数增加仅5%，推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习几何适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构建立了可扩展且可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

Conclusion: 提出的组合水印方法能有效检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑，为专有语言模型的版权保护提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

Result: 建立了严格的理论保证，证明了次二次运行时间，并为多项式注意力的经验成功提供了首个理论依据。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了有界输入的限制，为现代大语言模型提供了实用的次二次注意力近似解决方案。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

Result: 严格的数值研究表明，该方法显著超越了能够访问源域样本的现有方法。

Conclusion: REFEREE方法成功解决了无源跨域持续学习问题，在无需源域样本的情况下实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络剪枝方法在达到中等稀疏度（50-60%）后难以进一步提升，否则会严重损害模型精度，这限制了大型语言模型的计算和内存优化潜力。

Method: Elsa方法通过识别现有方法依赖代理目标函数的局限性，采用基于ADMM的标准约束优化技术，直接有效地解决剪枝问题。

Result: 在多种模型和规模上的实验表明，Elsa显著优于现有方法，如在LLaMA-2-7B模型上90%稀疏度时困惑度比最佳现有方法低7.8倍。还开发了量化变体Elsa-L，可扩展到极大模型（27B）。

Conclusion: Elsa在推进LLM稀疏化前沿方面取得了有意义的进展，表明在目前探索有限的方向上仍存在显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

TL;DR: AsyPPO是一种用于大语言模型强化学习的框架，通过轻量级mini-critics解决传统价值函数在LLM规模下的计算瓶颈，提升学习稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL4LLM方法避免使用显式critics，因为传统价值函数在LLM规模下计算成本高，且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下容易失败。

Method: 使用一组轻量级mini-critics，每个在不相交的提示分片上训练，利用critic间不确定性来优化策略更新，包括屏蔽优势值和过滤高分歧状态。

Result: 在仅5000个样本上训练后，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提升学习稳定性和性能，在Qwen3-4b-Base上比经典PPO提升超过6%，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上提升约3%。

Conclusion: 架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性，AsyPPO成功恢复了critics的作用，同时保持了大模型设置下的效率。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

TL;DR: TimeHUT是一种通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡对比表示来学习时间序列表示的新方法，在分类任务上显著优于先前方法，在异常检测上获得有竞争力的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在在嵌入空间中实现均匀性和容忍度之间的有效平衡，以学习强健的时间序列表示。

Method: 使用层次化设置学习实例级和时间信息，集成温度调度器平衡嵌入特性，应用层次化角度边缘损失增强正负样本对的几何分离。

Result: 在128个UCR和30个UAE数据集上的分类任务中表现优于先前方法，在Yahoo和KPI数据集上的异常检测获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡有效提升了时间序列表示学习性能，特别是在分类任务上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

*Wangxuan Fan,Ching Wang,Siqi Li,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ShapKAN剪枝框架，使用Shapley值评估KAN网络中节点重要性，解决传统基于幅度的剪枝方法在KAN中不可靠的问题，实现网络压缩同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络虽然能恢复符号表示并保持竞争力，但其架构对网络剪枝带来独特挑战。传统基于幅度的剪枝方法由于对输入坐标偏移敏感而不可靠。

Method: 使用Shapley值归因来评估节点重要性，以平移不变的方式量化每个节点的实际贡献，确保重要性排名不受输入参数化影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShapKAN能保持真实节点重要性，同时实现有效的网络压缩。

Conclusion: ShapKAN提高了KAN的可解释性优势，便于在资源受限环境中部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### [200] [Beyond Simple Fusion: Adaptive Gated Fusion for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01677)
*Han Wu,Yanming Sun,Yunhe Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应门控融合网络(AGFN)，通过基于信息熵和模态重要性的双门融合机制自适应调整特征权重，以解决多模态情感分析中模态质量变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析中，简单的融合技术往往无法处理模态质量变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突），导致在识别细微情感时性能不佳。

Method: 使用双门融合机制，基于信息熵和模态重要性自适应调整特征权重，在单模态编码和跨模态交互后优先选择信息丰富的线索。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上的实验表明，AGFN在准确率上显著优于强基线，能有效识别细微情感且性能稳健。

Conclusion: AGFN通过减少特征位置与预测误差之间的相关性，从更广泛的特征分布中学习，从而增强泛化能力，创建更稳健的多模态特征表示。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的悲观式品类优化框架PASTA，用于在离线数据驱动环境下解决品类优化问题，无需完整覆盖所有可行品类即可实现最优预期收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 品类优化问题在离线数据驱动环境中面临数据覆盖不足的挑战，因为企业缺乏对底层选择模型的先验知识，需要基于历史客户选择数据确定最优品类。

Method: 引入悲观式品类优化框架PASTA，利用悲观主义原则在通用选择模型下实现最优预期收益，仅要求离线数据分布包含最优品类而非覆盖所有可行品类。

Result: 为多项logit和嵌套logit等广泛使用的选择模型建立了首个有限样本遗憾界，推导了极小极大遗憾下界，证明PASTA在样本和模型复杂度方面达到极小极大最优。

Conclusion: PASTA框架在理论和实验上都优于现有基线方法，为解决离线品类优化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

### [202] [Representational Alignment Across Model Layers and Brain Regions with Hierarchical Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01706)
*Shaan Shah,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT)框架，通过全局最优传输解决神经网络表示对齐问题，能够处理不同深度网络的对齐，提供单一对齐分数和软传输计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准表示相似性方法存在局限性：独立对齐每层产生不对称结果、缺乏全局对齐分数、难以处理不同深度网络。这些问题源于忽略全局激活结构和限制为刚性的一对一层对应。

Method: HOT联合推断软性、全局一致的层到层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元跨多个目标层分布质量，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本。

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录上的评估显示，HOT在对齐质量上匹配或超越标准成对匹配，并揭示平滑、细粒度的层次对应关系。

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别是在网络架构或深度不同的情况下。

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

*Aidan Acquah,Shing Chan,Aiden Doherty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActiNet模型（自监督ResNet-V2 + 隐马尔可夫模型）在腕部加速度计数据上用于人类活动强度分类，性能优于传统的随机森林+HMM方法，在CAPTURE-24数据集上取得平均宏F1分数0.82和Cohen's kappa分数0.86。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型流行病学研究中，需要可靠准确的人类活动识别模型来分析腕部加速度计数据，以研究体力活动与健康结果之间的关联。虽然自监督学习在改进HAR方面引起了广泛关注，但这些模型与隐马尔可夫模型结合能在多大程度上改善分类性能及其对预测日常活动强度组成的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练ActiNet模型（自监督的18层改进ResNet-V2模型），然后进行隐马尔可夫模型平滑来分类活动强度标签。通过5折分层组交叉验证评估性能，并与文献中建立的基线随机森林+HMM进行比较。

Result: ActiNet模型能够以平均宏F1分数0.82和平均Cohen's kappa分数0.86区分活动强度标签，超过了在同一数据集上训练和验证的RF+HMM的性能（平均分数分别为0.77和0.81）。这些发现在年龄和性别的亚组中保持一致。

Conclusion: 这些发现鼓励在未来的流行病学研究中使用ActiNet从腕部加速度计数据中提取活动强度标签。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的联邦多模态学习框架能够有效降低系统延迟并提升模型性能，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

*Jialin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) 是一种无损的注意力算法重构，通过基础分解矩阵恒等式重新组织多头投影，在保持精确输出的同时实现数学保证的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制是大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化方法如FlashAttention主要是系统层面的I/O优化，缺乏数学保证的算法级加速方法。

Method: 基于基础分解(BD)的矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重新组织为紧凑形式，无需重新训练，仅需少量离线准备时间。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16)上，BDA实现了32%更快的键/值投影和25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%(FP16)或0.0004%(FP32)，对模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论上精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为注意力机制提供了数学保证的加速方案。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个使用线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习算法，解决了分布鲁棒强化学习中的模型不确定性，无需生成模型访问，样本复杂度为O(1/ε²)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鲁棒TD学习收敛保证仅限于表格MDP或依赖限制性折扣因子假设，需要填补鲁棒RL算法实证成功与理论保证之间的关键差距。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，针对总变差距离和Wasserstein距离不确定性集设计模型无关算法。

Result: 建立了获得ε-准确值估计的O(1/ε²)样本复杂度，填补了鲁棒RL与非鲁棒对应算法之间的理论保证差距。

Conclusion: 该算法成功将鲁棒TD学习扩展到线性函数逼近，关键思想可相对直接地扩展到带函数逼近的鲁棒Q学习。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用深度神经网络(DNN)替代传统离散选择模型(DCM)来建模工作地点选择，DNN在某些方面表现优于DCM，但DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更吻合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个体决策过程方面存在挑战，需要开发能更好理解复杂决策模式的方法。

Method: 使用深度神经网络(DNN)方法建模工作地点选择决策，并与传统离散选择模型(DCM)进行比较分析。

Result: DNN在某些方面优于DCM，但DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更吻合；DCM在短距离表现更好，DNN在长距离与DCM表现相当。

Conclusion: 选择工作地点选择分析模型时应根据具体应用需求，两种模型各有优势，需要权衡使用。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

Motivation: 研究DPSGD对神经网络模型公平性的影响，验证直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是否能实现与非隐私模型相当的公平性水平。

Method: 通过比较DPSGD对不同性能指标的差异影响，并在广泛的超参数设置下进行分析，包括评估DPSGD-Global-Adapt变体。

Result: 发现不同性能指标的不公平影响并不一致，直接优化超参数不能可靠减轻DPSGD的不公平影响，但能改善效用-公平性权衡；DPSGD-Global-Adapt对超参数选择不稳健。

Conclusion: 超参数调优会带来额外的隐私泄露，需要在隐私、效用和公平性之间谨慎权衡；DPSGD-Global-Adapt不是解决不公平影响的稳健方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

Motivation: 视觉任务中的潜在表示常受到噪声或无关特征的影响，这会降低模型的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 无监督DFS方法能有效增强潜在表示，提高模型性能，且不依赖标注数据，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Result: 现有过滤器表现出有限的特异性和一致性，仅对真实图像具有高敏感性，但无法可靠检测训练数据生成的近重复样本。

Conclusion: 后处理过滤方法存在关键局限性，在敏感应用中部署前需要过滤器设计的重大改进。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

Conclusion: G²RPO框架通过改进的采样策略和优势集成机制，成功解决了流模型强化学习中的奖励评估问题，实现了更好的偏好对齐效果。

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种宽-窄-宽（Hourglass）MLP块结构，挑战了传统的窄-宽-窄MLP设计。Hourglass结构在扩展维度上使用跳跃连接，而残差计算通过窄瓶颈进行，实现了在保持计算效率的同时利用高维空间进行增量精化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统MLP的窄-宽-窄设计惯例，探索跳跃连接在扩展维度上操作的可能性，以利用高维空间进行更有效的特征精化。

Method: 提出Hourglass MLP块结构，其中跳跃连接在扩展维度上操作，残差计算通过窄瓶颈进行。使用随机初始化的固定投影将输入信号提升到扩展维度，并在整个训练过程中保持不变。

Result: Hourglass架构在生成任务上始终优于传统设计，实现了更优的性能-参数Pareto边界。随着参数预算增加，最优Hourglass配置倾向于更深的网络、更宽的跳跃连接和更窄的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要重新考虑现代架构中跳跃连接的放置方式，这种设计思路可扩展到Transformer和其他残差网络。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

TL;DR: 提出稀疏查询注意力(SQA)架构，通过减少查询头数量来降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，在长序列处理中实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer中多头注意力(MHA)的二次计算复杂度问题，现有方法如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力得分计算所需的FLOPs。

Method: 通过减少查询头数量而非键/值头来降低注意力计算复杂度，提出SQA架构及其变体家族。

Result: 在32k-200k长序列基准测试中，SQA在计算受限场景下实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，对模型质量影响很小。

Conclusion: SQA是构建更高效可扩展模型的有力工具，在Reactive Transformer架构开发过程中偶然发现。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布估计算法依赖学习显式变量依赖图，成本高且难以有效捕捉复杂交互。需要一种更高效的组合优化方法。

Method: 使用多变量自回归生成模型，在训练时随机采样生成顺序（信息保留dropout），使模型对变量顺序不变，并采用广义强化策略优化进行稳定策略梯度更新。

Result: 在多种基准算法和不同规模问题实例上，该方法经常获得最佳性能，并始终避免灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 顺序不变强化学习框架在组合优化中表现出色，通过促进搜索空间多样性和关注最相关变量依赖，提高了样本效率和性能稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Motivation: 传统AutoML方法依赖耗能的超参数搜索，而预选预测作为有前景的替代方案，能够通过智能预选模型来避免穷举搜索，但目前文献中对此研究不足。

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Motivation: 离散扩散模型为分类数据（如文本和图像）提供了统一框架，具有更快推理、更精细控制和无需训练即可进行贝叶斯推理的优势，特别适合后验采样。但现有方法面临梯度稀疏、适用性受限和维度诅咒等问题。

Conclusion: APS方法有效克服了离散扩散后验采样的现有挑战，为预训练扩散基础模型的后验采样提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

Method: 通过自监督对比学习目标，在共享潜在空间中联合嵌入逻辑规范和系统表示，利用模型检查任务作为指导信号。

Conclusion: 模型检查可以作为学习形式语言表示的目标，CNML方法展示了这一方向的潜力。

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and

Conclusion: LieNLSD在发现非线性对称性方面具有定性优势，能够显式获得李代数子空间，提升物理系统的建模精度。

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Motivation: 传统扩散和基于流的生成模型使用非平衡、时间条件动力学，EqM旨在通过学习平衡梯度来替代这种复杂的时间条件动态。

Method: EqM丢弃传统模型中的时间条件动态，学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度，在推理时采用基于梯度下降的优化采样过程，支持可调步长、自适应优化器和自适应计算。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上达到1.90 FID，超越扩散/流模型的生成性能，并能处理部分噪声图像去噪、OOD检测和图像合成等任务。

Conclusion: EqM通过用统一的平衡景观替代时间条件速度，提供了流模型与能量基模型之间更紧密的桥梁，以及优化驱动推理的简单途径。

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表达能力和概率推断的数据效率，实现了快速组合式元学习。

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and

TL;DR: 提出MMtSBM方法，用于从非配对数据中生成视频，通过多边际时间Schrödinger桥匹配来重建隐藏的动态过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然动态过程（如细胞分化、疾病进展）只能通过静态样本快照观察，重建其时间演化以揭示动态特性对科学研究很重要

Method: 扩展Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching，推导出多边际的迭代马尔可夫拟合算法，采用因子化方式处理多个边际分布

Result: 在玩具示例中保留理论性质，在真实世界数据集（如100维转录组轨迹推断）上达到最先进性能，首次在超高维图像设置中恢复耦合和动态

Conclusion: 多边际Schrödinger桥是恢复静态数据中隐藏动态的实用且有原则的方法

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力变换器的多模态基础模型，整合电子健康记录、医学影像、遗传学和可穿戴设备数据，通过专用编码器和多头注意力机制实现跨模态关联，支持多任务预训练和轻松适应新疾病。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断模型孤立分析不同医疗数据源，限制了发现跨模态相关性以实现早期疾病诊断的能力。

Method: 使用专用编码器将各模态数据映射到共享潜在空间，通过多头注意力和残差归一化进行融合，设计支持多任务预训练的架构。

Result: 在肿瘤学、心脏病学和神经学基准数据集上测试早期检测任务，提供数据治理和模型管理工具以提高透明度和临床可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法朝着精准诊断的统一基础模型发展，有望提高预测准确性并辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探索了Tsetlin Machine在大型多通道图像分类中的应用，提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法，在保持可解释性的同时实现了与深度学习模型相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Tsetlin Machine基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑，比神经网络更具可解释性。本文旨在探索TM架构在大规模多通道图像分类中的适用性，同时保持其可解释性优势。

Method: 提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于说明模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56% F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: TM在复杂大规模训练环境中仍能保持竞争力，同时维持其可解释性。这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为将TM应用于更复杂多样的数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统比较了传统GNN增强方法和LLM在图增强方法在复合图缺陷下的表现，提出了RoGRAD框架，通过检索增强生成和迭代图对比学习实现动态优化，显著提升了图神经网络在缺陷图上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据存在多种缺陷，严重影响了GNN的性能。现有研究主要关注单一缺陷的鲁棒性，缺乏对复合缺陷下传统GNN方法和LLM增强方法的系统性比较，不清楚各自的优劣。

Method: 提出RoGRAD框架：采用检索增强生成(RAG)注入基于检索的增强，提供类别一致且多样化的增强数据；通过迭代图对比学习强制区分性表示；将LLM增强从静态信号注入转变为动态优化过程。

Result: RoGRAD在广泛实验中表现出色，优于传统GNN和LLM增强基线方法，平均提升达到82.43%。

Conclusion: LLM增强在图学习中并非总是最优，RoGRAD通过迭代动态优化框架有效解决了复合图缺陷问题，为图神经网络在现实场景中的应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何感知的LoRA扩展方法，通过三因子分解U-S-V^⊤，将适配器的输入和输出子空间与缩放因子分离，并将U和V约束在Stiefel流形上保持正交性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低秩适配(LoRA)方法在性能上仍落后于全微调，部分原因是对低秩流形几何结构利用不足。

Method: 使用三因子分解U-S-V^⊤，将U和V约束在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，采用几何优化设计将欧几里得优化器转换为黎曼优化器。

Result: 在常识推理、数学和代码生成、图像分类和图像生成等广泛下游任务中，该方法优于现有的最先进LoRA变体。

Conclusion: 提出的几何感知LoRA扩展方法能够更有效地学习子空间，同时保持与现有微调管道的兼容性，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

Motivation: 现有对抗鲁棒性研究主要关注0-1损失，缺乏对任意损失函数下鲁棒风险最小化问题的系统分析，特别是交叉熵等常用损失函数的理论支撑不足。

Method: 采用对偶理论和重心重构方法，推导鲁棒风险最小化问题的对偶形式，为不同损失函数提供显式表征，并建立与α-公平打包问题和广义重心问题的理论联系。

Result: 获得了交叉熵损失、幂形式损失和二次损失的显式对偶重构，提供了更紧的对抗风险下界，数值实验验证了交叉熵损失下更优的鲁棒性边界。

Conclusion: 提出的对偶和重心重构框架为任意损失函数下的对抗鲁棒分类提供了理论基础和计算工具，揭示了对抗鲁棒性与优化理论中经典问题的深层联系。

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

TL;DR: Moon是一个基于模态转换的监督式多元时间序列异常检测框架，通过将数值时间序列转换为图像表示，结合多模态CNN和SHAP解释器，显著提升了检测效率、准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTS异常检测方法存在三个主要问题：无监督方法依赖误差阈值导致不准确；半监督方法未充分利用异常标签；监督方法难以捕捉局部关系、计算成本高且受限于标注数据稀缺。

Method: 提出MV-MTF技术将数值时间序列转换为图像表示，使用多模态CNN融合数值和图像数据，最后通过SHAP解释器识别关键异常变量。

Result: 在6个真实世界MTS数据集上的实验表明，Moon在效率上最高提升93%，准确性提升4%，解释性能提升10.8%，优于6种最先进方法。

Conclusion: Moon框架通过模态转换和多模态融合，有效解决了现有MTS异常检测方法的局限性，在效率、准确性和可解释性方面均取得显著提升。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在万维网应用中，可靠的时间序列预测对于资源规划、缓存放置和异常响应至关重要，需要比传统领域更快的响应速度来支持实时决策。

Method: 采用非自回归设计，直接建模分段级多峰分布，避免了自回归方法中的误差累积问题，同时改进了现有非自回归模型过度平滑预测的缺点。

Result: 在大规模语料库上训练后，KAIROS在六个广泛使用的基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，预测性能与类似规模的顶级基础模型相当，但推理成本仅为它们的一小部分。

Conclusion: KAIROS强调了非自回归设计作为时间序列基础模型可扩展范式的重要性，为Web应用提供了高效的实时预测解决方案。

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Conclusion: 几何信息探索为抗菌肽设计提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

TL;DR: GraphNC是一个图异常检测框架，通过教师模型在异常分数和节点表示空间中联合校准图的正常性，包括分数分布对齐和基于扰动的正常性正则化两个组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督图异常检测方法学习的正常性仅限于标记的正常节点，容易过拟合给定模式，导致高检测错误率如高误报率。

Method: GraphNC包含两个主要组件：异常分数分布对齐（ScoreDA）通过将模型异常分数与教师模型生成的分数分布对齐来优化分数；基于扰动的正常性正则化（NormReg）通过在标记节点上最小化扰动引导的一致性损失来使正常节点表示更紧凑。

Result: 分数对齐有效将正常和异常类别的异常分数拉向两端，产生更可分离的异常分数；正常性正则化缓解了教师模型不准确分数的误导。

Conclusion: GraphNC通过联合校准异常分数和节点表示空间中的正常性，克服了现有半监督图异常检测方法的局限性，提高了检测性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert
demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are
difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are
limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an
opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The
George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic
approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,
representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

*Hanyang Zhao,Dawen Liang,Wenpin Tang,David Yao,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiFFPO是一个统一的强化学习框架，用于训练掩码扩散大语言模型（dLLMs），使其推理能力更强（furious）且速度更快。通过离策略RL训练代理策略，结合两阶段似然近似和重要性采样校正，提高了样本效率和任务性能。同时，通过联合训练高效采样器，让模型自适应分配推理阈值，在减少函数评估次数的同时获得更好准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如d1在训练dLLMs时存在局限性，需要统一的框架来同时提升推理质量和速度。通过RL训练可以更好地利用dLLMs的多令牌预测能力，并优化推理时的计算效率。

Method: 1. 使用离策略RL训练代理策略，提出更准确的两阶段似然近似方法结合重要性采样校正；2. 联合训练dLLMs策略的高效采样器/控制器，让模型自适应分配每个提示的推理阈值。

Result: 在数学和规划基准任务上训练开源大扩散语言模型，结果显示该方法在样本效率和任务性能上优于现有方法，在减少函数评估次数的同时获得了更好的准确率，优化了dLLMs推理时计算的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: DiFFPO框架通过统一的RL方法成功提升了dLLMs的推理质量和速度，联合训练采样器的方法在计算效率和性能之间取得了更好的平衡，为扩散语言模型的优化提供了有效途径。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMF-VI是一种自适应混合流变分推理方法，通过结合互补的流模型（MAF、RealNVP、RBIG）来提升变分推理的鲁棒性和性能，在多种后验分布上表现稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一流模型在不同性质的后验分布上表现不一致，需要一种更稳健的变分推理方法来处理多样化的后验分布。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先顺序训练各个流专家模型，然后通过似然驱动的更新进行自适应全局权重估计，无需逐样本门控或架构修改。

Result: 在六个标准后验分布（香蕉形、X形、双月形、环形、双峰和五峰混合）上，AMF-VI始终获得比单一流基线更低的负对数似然，并在Wasserstein-2距离和最大均值差异指标上表现稳定提升。

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样化流模型为跨不同后验分布的稳健变分推理提供了可靠途径，同时保留了每个专家的归纳偏置，方法高效且架构无关。

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型虽然能够从PPG波形中提取丰富生理信息，但依赖难以解释的特征，导致预测能力、临床可解释性和传感器设计之间存在矛盾。

Method: 提出PPGen生物物理模型和混合摊销推理（HAI）方法，结合模型校正，从PPG信号中估计生理参数。

Result: 在广泛的模拟实验中，HAI能够在不同噪声和传感器条件下准确推断生理参数。

Conclusion: 该方法为PPG模型提供了一条路径，既保持了基于DL特征所需的保真度，又支持临床解释和硬件设计。

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

Conclusion: 提出的最大似然估计微调方法有效解决了Flow Matching的训练-推理间隙问题，并改善了模型性能。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的在线策略训练在单次更新后丢弃经验，导致计算效率低下和不稳定性。虽然有工作强调重用过去经验的好处，但经验特性在大型推理模型学习动态中的作用仍未充分探索。

Method: 提出ExGRPO框架，识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），组织并优先处理有价值的经验，使用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用。

Result: 在五个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上的实验显示，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上平均比在线策略RLVR提升+3.5/7.6分，并在强弱模型上稳定训练。

Conclusion: 原则性的经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Motivation: 当前权重空间学习需要大量计算资源构建模型动物园，限制了表示学习的规模和灵活性。本文旨在摆脱这一限制，直接从大型非结构化模型仓库学习权重表示。

Method: 提出了一种新的权重空间骨干网络，专门设计用于处理非结构化模型群体中的异构性，包括不同架构、数据集和文档不完整的模型。

Result: 在Hugging Face模型上训练的权重空间表示实现了强大性能，通常优于在实验室生成模型动物园上训练的骨干网络，并能泛化到未见过的数据模态。

Conclusion: 研究表明高质量权重空间表示可以在非结构化环境中学习，精心策划的模型动物园并非不可或缺，克服了权重空间学习社区当前面临的重要限制。

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

Motivation: AdaBoost在实践中随着弱学习器数量增加而泛化良好，但其指数损失难以优化。PENEX旨在提供一个理论上有依据且易于优化的替代方案。

Method: 引入PENEX损失函数，该函数可隐式最大化数据点的边界，并通过梯度增量隐式参数化提升框架中的弱学习器。

Result: 在计算机视觉和语言任务中，PENEX表现出比现有方法更好的正则化效果，且计算成本相似。

Conclusion: PENEX作为AdaBoost启发的替代方案，在深度神经网络的训练和微调中具有潜力。

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端框架，在空间数据匹配任务中实现精确的召回率控制，通过轻量级神经网络排序器和多方法集成，显著降低召回率方差和人工验证成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模空间数据匹配任务中，精确的召回率控制至关重要，因为遗漏少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度的手动验证会增加成本。传统方法存在召回率过高和方差大的问题。

Method: 使用等网格边界框过滤和CSR候选表示减少配对枚举，通过确定性xxHash引导样本训练轻量级神经网络排序器，采用四种互补的阈值估计器（Clopper-Pearson、Jeffreys、Wilson和精确分位数）进行逆方差加权集成。

Result: 在两个真实地籍数据集（约631万和6734万对）上评估，该方法能持续达到目标召回率且误差很小，相比其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，可在单个TPU v3核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持TPU友好的同时，实现了精确的召回率控制和低方差，显著提高了大规模空间数据匹配任务的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

*Jianing Qi,Hao Tang,Zhigang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG)，将扩散模型中的classifier-free guidance扩展到经典策略梯度方法，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支实现无需重新训练的行为调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将扩散模型中的引导技术扩展到标准在线强化学习方法，实现可控的行为调节而无需重新训练。

Method: 在策略梯度中添加无条件分支，插值条件分支和无条件分支，通过优势估计消除归一化项，得到简洁的引导策略梯度更新公式。

Result: 在离散和连续控制基准测试中，条件dropout在简单离散任务和低样本量情况下有效，但会破坏连续控制的稳定性；适度增大引导系数（γ>1）能持续提升稳定性、样本效率和可控性。

Conclusion: 引导技术可以成功应用于标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 提出了DialTree-RPO框架，通过强化学习和树搜索自动发现多样的多轮攻击策略，在10个目标模型上比现有方法攻击成功率提高25.9%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互中容易受到对抗攻击，现有方法要么依赖人工红队测试，要么使用预定义模板，未能充分探索多轮攻击的广阔空间，而研究表明LLM对多轮攻击的脆弱性显著高于单轮攻击。

Method: DialTree-RPO框架，将对话视为顺序决策问题，结合树搜索的在线策略强化学习，无需人工标注数据即可系统探索多轮攻击策略。

Result: 在10个目标模型上，攻击成功率比现有最优方法提高25.9%以上，并有效发现了新的攻击策略，通过学习最大化多轮攻击成功率的对话策略。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自主发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，显著提高了攻击成功率，为LLM安全评估提供了更有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

TL;DR: 提出了动作触发稀疏可追踪马尔可夫决策过程（ATST-MDPs）框架，针对状态观测由动作随机触发的强化学习问题。开发了ST-LSVI-UCB算法，在稀疏观测约束下实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中状态观测由动作随机触发的强化学习问题，这类约束在许多实际场景中很常见。

Method: 推导了针对该框架的Bellman最优方程，引入动作序列学习范式，在观测到达前执行动作序列。在线性MDP假设下，价值函数在诱导的动作序列特征映射中具有线性表示。

Result: 提出了具有统计误差保证的离策略估计器，ST-LSVI-UCB算法实现了$\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 为稀疏动作触发观测下的学习建立了理论基础，证明在此类观测约束下高效学习仍然是可行的。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

Motivation: 经典SGLD无法偏向平坦最小值，而平坦最小值与深度学习泛化能力密切相关

Method: 使用随机权重扰动(RWP)的随机梯度，优化随机平滑目标来隐式捕获曲率信息

Result: 理论证明fSGLD收敛到Hessian迹正则化的全局最小化器，实验显示在噪声标签和大规模视觉任务中实现优越泛化和鲁棒性

Conclusion: fSGLD能有效寻找平坦最小值，保持SGD计算效率的同时达到与SAM相当或更好的性能

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络训练遵循固定的优化方案，缺乏动态响应训练不稳定或问题的灵活性。

Method: 使用控制服务器作为用户/代理与训练过程之间的中介，支持实时干预和调整。

Result: 通过三个案例研究表明，该方法实现了更好的训练稳定性、降低了对初始超参数的敏感性，并提高了对用户需求的适应性。

Conclusion: 为AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定性和优化训练动态的未来训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过理论和实验验证了扩散模型成功的关键在于其能够适应数据中的低维几何结构，特别是通过平滑分数函数在数据流形上的切向平滑来实现泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在各种领域表现出卓越的泛化能力，但其机制尚未完全理解。基于流形假设，研究者推测这种成功源于模型适应数据低维几何结构的能力。

Method: 通过研究经验分数匹配目标最小化器的平滑效应来检查隐式正则化的作用，分析平滑分数函数（或等价地在对数密度域中平滑）如何产生沿数据流形的切向平滑。

Result: 理论和实证结果证实，平滑分数函数确实会产生沿数据流形的切向平滑，并且可以通过选择适当的平滑来控制扩散模型泛化的流形。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的强大泛化能力可以通过其适应数据低维几何结构的能力来解释，特别是通过平滑分数函数在数据流形上的切向平滑机制。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

*Daniel Gallo Fernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Poolformer是一个序列到序列模型，用循环层和池化操作替代自注意力机制，解决了长序列处理中自注意力二次复杂度的问题，在音频处理任务上表现优于现有先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在长序列处理中存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其在实际应用中的实用性。研究者希望开发一种更高效的序列建模方法来处理长序列数据。

Method: 使用循环层替代自注意力，并引入池化操作来减少序列长度。模型采用递归定义的SkipBlock结构，包含残差块、下采样池化层、嵌套SkipBlock、上采样池化层和额外残差块。

Result: 池化操作显著加速训练过程，改善感知指标（FID和IS），并防止过拟合。在原始音频数据上，Poolformer超越了SaShiMi和Mamba等最先进模型。

Conclusion: Poolformer通过池化和循环层的结合，有效处理长序列数据，深层处理长程依赖关系，浅层处理短期特征，为文本、视觉和多模态应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

TL;DR: StockBench是一个无污染的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在真实多个月股票交易环境中的表现，填补了金融领域动态交易评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态和迭代特性。金融领域对LLM代理的研究不足，尽管其与经济价值和高风险决策直接相关。

Method: 构建StockBench基准，让代理接收每日市场信号（价格、基本面、新闻），做出连续的买卖或持有决策，使用累积回报、最大回撤和索提诺比率等金融指标评估性能。

Result: 评估显示大多数LLM代理难以跑赢简单的买入持有基准，但部分模型显示出获得更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力。

Conclusion: 精通静态金融知识任务不一定能转化为成功的交易策略，StockBench作为开源资源支持可重复性和该领域未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据由异质用户群体组成，但单一全局目标训练的大规模推荐模型会忽略头尾分布区域，导致注意力权重失效或神经元死亡，限制了模型学习能力。

Method: 利用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，通过定制注意力层学习过程来保持与少数群体的互信息，同时提升全局性能。

Result: 在包含数十亿数据点的生产数据集上评估，C2AL方法使因子分解机能够捕捉细粒度用户-广告交互，整体归一化熵降低0.16%，在目标少数群体上增益超过0.30%。

Conclusion: 通过暴露具有强分布对比的子结构并利用辅助学习，可以有效解决大规模推荐模型中的异质性问题，提升模型对少数群体的学习能力。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

Motivation: 扩散生成插补方法虽然表现出色，但其在捕捉缺失值与观测值之间复杂时空依赖关系的理论理解仍然有限，需要研究其统计效率和不确定性量化。

Method: 基于条件扩散变换器，推导条件评分函数的近似理论，建立统计样本复杂度界限，构建缺失值的置信区域，并提出混合掩码训练策略。

Result: 研究发现插补效率和准确性受缺失模式显著影响，理论分析通过模拟验证，混合掩码训练能有效提升插补性能。

Conclusion: 扩散变换器在时序数据插补中具有统计效率保证，缺失模式是关键影响因素，混合掩码训练是有效的性能提升策略。

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

Result: 该方法比自回归采样快几个数量级，并通过减轻误差累积现象提高了样本路径质量。

Conclusion: copula方法能够高效地从多步时间序列基础模型生成准确相关的样本路径，解决了自回归采样的成本和误差问题。

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了Transformer和xLSTM的扩展规律，发现在典型的LLM训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer具有更好的扩展性，且随着训练和推理上下文长度的增加，xLSTM的优势更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展规律在大型语言模型成功中起着核心作用，能够预测模型性能与计算预算的关系。虽然Transformer是主导架构，但xLSTM等替代方案在保持竞争力的同时具有线性复杂度。需要比较这两种架构的扩展行为来指导未来模型设计和部署。

Method: 1. 在广泛模型规模(80M-7B)和训练token数量(2B-2T)上，使用IsoFLOP和参数拟合方法研究xLSTM在计算最优和过训练机制中的扩展行为；2. 检查最优模型大小对上下文长度的依赖性；3. 分析推理时扩展特性。

Result: 研究发现，在典型的LLM训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer具有更有利的扩展性。重要的是，随着训练和推理上下文的增长，xLSTM的优势会扩大。

Conclusion: xLSTM在扩展性方面优于Transformer，特别是在长上下文场景中表现更佳，这为未来模型架构选择提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

*Kaja Gruntkowska,Yassine Maziane,Zheng Qu,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Drop-Muon方法，挑战传统全网络更新范式，通过随机选择部分层进行更新，结合渐进式训练和非欧几里得更新，实现更高效的深度学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习优化要求每步更新所有层，但作者认为这种全网络更新在理论和实践中都存在根本性次优问题，需要探索更高效的训练方式。

Method: 提出Drop-Muon框架，采用随机渐进训练方法，每步只更新部分层，结合层特定的非欧几里得更新，提供收敛性保证。

Result: 在CNN实验中，Drop-Muon始终优于全网络Muon，达到相同精度时wall-clock时间快1.4倍，成本分析显示全网络更新仅在特定条件下最优。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要改变大规模模型训练方式，Drop-Muon为全网络更新提供了理论扎实且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

*Tobias Kreiman,Yutong Bai,Fadi Atieh,Elizabeth Weaver,Eric Qu,Aditi S. Krishnapriyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究表明，未经修改的标准Transformer架构可以直接在笛卡尔坐标上训练，无需预定义图结构或物理先验，就能达到与最先进等变图神经网络相当的分子能量和力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在分子机器学习中依赖预定义的图结构（如固定半径截断或k近邻），这限制了表达能力并降低了推理速度。本文旨在探索纯Transformer是否能在没有图结构先验的情况下学习分子性质。

Method: 使用标准Transformer架构直接在笛卡尔坐标上训练，不引入任何预定义图结构或物理先验，与等变GNN在相同计算预算下进行比较。

Result: Transformer在OMol25数据集上达到了与最先进等变GNN竞争的能量和力平均绝对误差，并学习到了物理一致的注意力模式（如注意力权重与原子间距离成反比衰减）。

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模提供了标准化、可扩展的架构方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion^2是一种基于扩散模型的方法，使用3D点云来建模从Wi-Fi到毫米波的广泛频率范围内的RF信号传播，比现有方法快27倍且误差仅为1.9 dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RF信号传播建模对于环境理解和无线诊断、部署、优化至关重要，但复杂环境中由于与障碍物的相互作用（如吸收和反射），准确预测RF信号仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出Diffusion^2方法，使用RF-3D编码器从3D数据中捕获RF相关特征，并通过多尺度嵌入模拟实际的RF信号传播过程。

Result: 在合成和真实世界测量中的评估表明，Diffusion^2在各种频率带和环境条件下准确估计RF信号行为，误差仅为1.9 dB，比现有方法快27倍。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2在RF信号传播建模领域取得了显著进展，为环境理解和无线应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Conclusion: 该数据集和建模见解将为交通预测研究提供宝贵资源，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型溯源和未经授权的蒸馏复制问题，关注模型来源验证。

Method: 模型无关框架，结合无数据输入合成和统计分数计算进行蒸馏检测。

Result: 在图像分类和文生图任务上显著提升检测准确率：CIFAR-10提升59.6%，ImageNet提升71.2%，文生图提升20.0%。

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest
baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image
generation. The code is available at

*Dhruv Kohli,Sawyer J. Robertson,Gal Mishne,Alexander Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LEGO方法，通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计数据流形的切空间，相比标准LPCA方法在噪声环境下表现更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LPCA方法在高噪声环境下存在邻域大小选择的权衡问题，需要先验几何和噪声知识，而实际中这些信息往往不可得。

Method: 利用图拉普拉斯的低频特征向量梯度，通过正交化处理来估计每个数据点的切空间，结合全局结构指导局部切空间估计。

Result: LEGO方法在噪声环境下显著优于LPCA，在下游任务如流形学习、边界检测和局部内在维度估计中表现更好。

Conclusion: LEGO通过利用全局结构信息，解决了LPCA在噪声环境下的局限性，为流形切空间估计提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

TL;DR: KaVa框架通过从教师模型的压缩KV缓存中蒸馏知识到潜在推理学生模型，解决了显式思维链推理的计算成本高和潜在推理缺乏监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式思维链推理虽然效果好但计算成本高，而潜在推理虽然高效但缺乏有效监督，限制了其在复杂自然语言推理中的效果。

Method: 使用自蒸馏方法，将教师模型压缩KV缓存中的知识直接蒸馏到潜在推理学生模型，利用连续潜在令牌的表示灵活性对齐逐步KV轨迹。

Result: 该方法持续优于强潜在基线，从仅方程到自然语言轨迹的退化显著减小，可扩展到更大骨干网络同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为潜在推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了CoT训练教师的准确性和潜在推理的效率和可部署性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.

Conclusion: MPMAvatar框架在创建具有物理合理动力学的3D人体化身方面取得了显著进展，特别是在处理松散衣物和复杂交互方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

TL;DR: 本文探索了在光学透视增强现实(OST-AR)中结合腕部振动触觉反馈的多模态方法，以改善深度感知和任务性能。通过定制腕带和实验验证，证明多模态反馈比纯视觉或纯触觉条件在空间精度和可用性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OST-AR依赖视觉叠加可能导致注意力过载，且在遮挡或光线不佳时深度线索不足。为解决这些限制，研究者探索结合腕部振动触觉反馈的多模态方法。

Method: 设计定制腕带配备六个振动电机提供方向和状态提示，将其与手持工具和OST-AR集成，通过形成性研究和两个实验(N=21和N=27)评估对提示识别和深度引导的影响。

Result: 实验显示参与者在认知负荷下能准确识别触觉模式，多模态反馈在空间精度和可用性方面优于纯视觉或纯触觉条件。

Conclusion: 结合OST-AR与腕部振动触觉的多模态反馈能有效改善深度感知和任务性能，为手部任务提供更优的引导方案。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) overlays digital targets and
annotations on the physical world, offering promising guidance for hands-on
tasks such as medical needle insertion or assembly. Recent work on OST-AR depth
perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly
affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument
reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair
performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and
leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers
perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that
combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have
seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated
skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind
users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal
audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn
feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of
longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors
found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.
These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on
wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors
delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and
OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a
formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants
accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal
feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or
haptic-only conditions.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable diagnostic tool, yet the
confined bore and acoustic noise can evoke considerable anxiety and
claustrophobic reactions. High anxiety leads to motion artifacts, incomplete
scans and reliance on pharmacological sedation. MIRAGE (Mixed Reality Anxiety
Guidance Environment) harnesses the latest mixed reality (MR) hardware to
prepare patients for MRI through immersive virtual reality (VR) and markerless
augmented reality (AR) registration. In this paper, we extend our previous work
by providing a comprehensive review of related research, detailing the system
architecture, and exploring metrics for patient and clinician experience. We
also present considerations for clinical deployment of MR systems within
hospital workflows. Our results indicate that depth-based registration achieves
sub-centimeter accuracy with minimal setup, while the immersive coaching
environment reduces patient anxiety and yields favourable usability scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在场景中均匀分配资源，限制了感兴趣区域的精细细节重建，导致模型尺寸过大。

Method: 提出对象感知框架，包括对象引导的相机选择、针对性对象训练，以及将高保真对象重建无缝集成到全局场景中。

Result: 实验显示ROI-GS显著提升局部质量（PSNR最高提升2.96 dB），模型大小减少约17%，对单对象场景训练更快。

Conclusion: ROI-GS在保持实时性能的同时，能够优先处理选定对象的高分辨率细节，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法通常依赖简化的BRDF模型或耦合漫反射和镜面分量的参数化，限制了材料恢复的准确性和重光照的保真度。

Method: 将微表面BRDF与镜面光泽度参数化集成到2D高斯泼溅中，采用延迟着色，利用基于扩散的表面法线和漫反射颜色先验指导早期优化，并通过环境图的粗到精优化加速收敛。

Result: 在复杂光泽场景上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了高质量的几何和材料重建，相比现有高斯泼溅方法，在新光照下提供了更真实和一致的重光照效果。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过物理一致的BRDF模型和有效的优化策略，显著提升了光泽物体的重建和重光照质量。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.
