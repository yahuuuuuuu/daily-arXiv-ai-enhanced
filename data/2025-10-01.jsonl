Multi-material\n3D printing using conductive PLA presents opportunities to mitigate these\nchallenges.

With our pipeline, users define touchpoints on the 3D\nobject's surface to indicate interactive regions. Our pipeline then\nautomatically generates a conductive path to connect the touch regions. This\npath is optimized to output unique resistor-capacitor delays when each region\nis touched, resulting in all regions being able to be sensed through a\ndouble-wire or single-wire connection. We illustrate our approach's utility\nwith five computational and sensing performance evaluations (achieving 93.35%\nmean accuracy for single-wire) and six application examples.

First, they do not\nreally see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for\nsemantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,\nleaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable\nperceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited\nvisual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically\nuses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,\nheterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining.

However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they\nstruggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,\nincluding identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of\nhallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper\nintroduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism\ndesigned to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,\nstructured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and\nvalues. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve\nrelevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We\ndemonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG\nenabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is\ninspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic\nknowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social\nsimulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline\nagents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall\nacross all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation\nconvergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini).

Finding steering methods that\ntransfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,\nwe introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection\n(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.\nWe demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of\nVLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors.

Current systems lack a framework\nthat can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,\nand therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with\nthree contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular\nclassification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,\nand system-level operations.

One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),\nwhich are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders\n(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an\nautoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based\nGR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our\nexperiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling\nproperties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable\nperformance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing\nbelief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,\nshowing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs\nscale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from\n44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR\nand position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR."}

In this\npaper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space\ndynamics to address the question: \"How do diffusion models memorize?\" We show\nthat memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during\nearly denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and\naccelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)\nmemorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is\nlarger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying\npredictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training\nimages into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and\nsteering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of\nintermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and\nreplaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising\nschedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity.

However, offering users verification of their data\nremoval post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification\nfor genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as\nusers' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the\nverification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for\nunlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding\nthe seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server\nrequires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a\nself-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including\nthe seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of\nthe original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a\ndelicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the\nself-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously\non the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model\nseeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through\nextensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective\nverification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations."}

However, a\npersistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across\noperating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work\ninvestigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)\nwithin a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter\nidentification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from\nthe same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related\ntasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise\ncharacteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear\nand cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under\nthree excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to\nreproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms\nwhen excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics.

Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans\nmonitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for\nintrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).\nDuring exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error\nor novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions\nrather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design\nthat uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the\ndynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the\nmodel errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide\nexploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is\nzero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that\nthe error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG.

To unlock learning from these hard samples,\nwe propose NuRL, a \"nudging\" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM\nreasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the\nproblem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the\nmodel generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge\nneeded to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the\nbase policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be\ninjected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and\nregenerate a new batch of trajectories.

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate\npotential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still\nremains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game\nprojects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.\n  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end\ncoordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of\nrunnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses\na Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints\nand engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces\nexecutable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific\ncomponent binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides\nreal-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated\nUniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not\nonly democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also\nreduces development time by 91.4%.

Our\nempirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting\nagents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent\nrisks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of\nsafety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of\nvulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical\nevidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety\nparadigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation\nstrategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy\nself-evolving agents.

Earlier works finetune\ndiffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited\nand difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local\nregions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this\nwork, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel\nre-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data\nor editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,\nIMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify\nmisalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion\nconditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)\nformulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively\nUpdated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing\nalignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,\nseamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods.

In reality, entities often exhibit local\nautonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by\nfeature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering\noutcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with\nsignificant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce\nautonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns\nand accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior\nknowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic\nannealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally\npromotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to\nexploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase\ntransitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further\nenhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network\n(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between\nentities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates\nvariable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across\ndiverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely\naligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it\nachieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring\nautonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%).

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses\non synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and\nasynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,\nand do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting\nintroduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot\nimplicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid\ncollisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the\nsystem, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges\nposed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We\ndevelop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between\nexploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their\narms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the\nfirst challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited\nby others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has\nleft, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm\nachieves a regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T \\log T} + {\\log T}/{\\Delta^2})$,\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms.

Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and\nweights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,\nwhile progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.\nSpecifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware\noptimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification\nacross all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the\nmagnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;\n3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to\nenhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns\nacross multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our\nresults demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art\nmethods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training\nresources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible\nperplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to\nthe dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,\nwe establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse\nmodel performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under\nquantization and fine-tuning scenarios."}

To address this, we propose\nDiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image\nconditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we\ndesign a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning.

Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently\nachieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,\nwhereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on\nembedding properties.

In this setting, the difference signal and the\nconsistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute\nsingle-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest\nX-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The\nmodel first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce\nnuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:\nstep 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates\nkeyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;\nstep 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the\nfinal answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that\nmatter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent\nattention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains\ncompetitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing\nintrinsic interpretability.

To achieve this, we introduce\nTruncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes\nfor dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be\ntrained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can\nearly-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger\nguardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:\nby evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can \"buy\" stronger\nguardrails from the same model.

An essential part of the ViG framework is the\nnode-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution\nmethods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been\nexplored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex\nnode-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements\nis needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation\nmethod in which the query projections come from the node, while the key\nprojections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel\narchitecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention\naggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing.

This dependence, which can manifest itself even as\nsimple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be\nindependently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A\ntoy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior\nlocal minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the\npresence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as\ncorrelations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail.

This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a\nstatistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we\nidentify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes\nlocal semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,\nplug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic\nsteps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget.

We\nidentify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length\ndistribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,\ninefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our\nobservations and call for further investigation into the remaining open\nchallenges.

Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently\nachieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,\nwhereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on\nembedding properties.

Early detection is critical to improving\nsurvival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor\noutcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal\nnevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians\nwithout specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low\nresolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of\nsegmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise\nsegmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust\ndiagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated\neffectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of\nannotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though\naccurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical\napplications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines\nmathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,\nleveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,\nreduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant\nperformance gains on high-resolution fundus images.

Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging\ncontinuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under\nultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions.

We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental.

This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a\nstatistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we\nidentify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes\nlocal semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,\nplug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic\nsteps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the\nsame movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to\ngenerate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in\nprogress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in\nour problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan\nis a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while\noptimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches\nand reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The\nembedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible\nfloorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs\nfar apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this\nembedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making\nit possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across\nextensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans\nfrom trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and\nguided-diffusion methods."}

Beyond known attack\nvectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable\nto fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive\ndemographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect\noutcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible\nyet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the\nretrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts\nfairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled\ndemographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis\nperformed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace\n(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),\neach integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic\nvariations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed\nanalysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with\nperturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the\nviolations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work\nreinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to\nprevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for\ndevelopers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs\nwithout compromising fairness or reliability."}

We provide the first principled analysis of\nthis offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that\nintegrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret\nbounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly\nconnecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency.

One\npromising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it\nquantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task\ncompletion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward\nlearning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,\nincluding robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances\nbetween frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise\nproxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments\non ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically\nimproves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10\ntasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This\napproach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed\nenvironment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.\nMoreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human\nvideos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward\nsignals from diverse video sources."}

Earlier methods improved spatial relationship\nfollowing with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to\nenhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.\nWe propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position\ncontrol into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via\nautomatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both\nspatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects\nwithin designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We\nfind that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate\nand cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully\ncomplete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for\nposition-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept\nof Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top\nmodels still have significant room for improvement in position-based\ngeneration. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances\nbase models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%\non PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on\nPosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while\nintegrating position control into leading models training-free.
