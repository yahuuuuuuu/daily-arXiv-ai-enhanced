Our approach combines two key contributions: a novel primitive, termed SuperFrustum, and an iterative fiting algorithm, Residual Primitive Fitting (ResFit). SuperFrustum is an analytical primitive that is simultaneously (1) expressive, being able to model various common solids such as cylinders, spheres, cones & their tapered and bent forms, (2) editable, being compactly parameterized with 8 parameters, and (3) optimizable, with a sign distance field differentiable w.r.t. its parameters almost everywhere. ResFit is an unsupervised procedure that interleaves global shape analysis with local optimization, iteratively fitting primitives to the unexplained residual of a shape to discover a parsimonious yet accurate decompositions for each input shape. On diverse 3D benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving IoU by over 9 points while using nearly half as many primitives as prior work. The resulting assemblies bridge the gap between dense 3D data and human-controllable design, producing high-fidelity and editable shape programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSuperFrustum\u57fa\u5143\u548cResFit\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u7b80\u6d01\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u76843D\u5f62\u72b6\u89e3\u6790\u5f0f\u57fa\u5143\u5206\u89e3", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b33D\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u5bc6\u96c63D\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u53ef\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408SuperFrustum\u57fa\u5143\uff088\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u5faeSDF\uff09\u548cResFit\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b8b\u5dee\u62df\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a3D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0cIoU\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc79\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c11\u8fd1\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u57fa\u5143\u6570\u91cf", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7b80\u6d01\u6027"}}

By embedding each canonical Gaussian primitive's local frame into a patch in the UV space of a template mesh in a computationally efficient manner, we reconstruct continuous editable material head textures from a single monocular video on a conventional UV domain. Furthermore, we leverage an efficient physically based reflectance model to enable relighting and editing of these intrinsic material maps.

WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to \"zoom into\" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features.

To benchmark temporal understanding capabilities in VLMMs, we propose VECTOR, designed to explicitly assess a model's ability to identify the temporal order of events. On this benchmark, we observe that various VLMMs often fail to understand the orders of events. To address this, we propose MECOT (Multi-Event instruction fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought), which (1) trains models on detailed, event-by-event video descriptions and (2) using chain-of-thought prompts at inference to enhance temporal awareness. MECOT outperforms prior arts on VECTOR as well as improving performance on existing video benchmarks, implying effectiveness of temporal understanding.

The Act-Then-Measure (ATM) heuristic addresses this challenge by decoupling control and measurement actions within the Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable Markov Decision Process (ACNO-MDP) framework. However, the standard ATM algorithm relies on a temporal-difference-inspired Q-learning method, which is prone to instability in sparse and noisy environments. In this work, we propose a Bayesian extension to ATM that replaces standard Q-learning with a Kalman filter-style Bayesian update, maintaining uncertainty-aware estimates of Q-values and enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning. We evaluate our method in both toy environments and clinically motivated testbeds. In small, tabular environments, Bayesian ATM achieves comparable or improved scalarized returns with substantially lower variance and more stable policy behavior. In contrast, in larger and more complex mHealth settings, both the standard and Bayesian ATM variants perform poorly, suggesting a mismatch between ATM's modeling assumptions and the structural challenges of real-world mHealth domains. These findings highlight the value of uncertainty-aware methods in low-data settings while underscoring the need for new RL algorithms that explicitly model causal structure, continuous states, and delayed feedback under observation cost constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6269\u5c55\u7684ATM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5f0f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6Q\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4f46\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u7684ATM\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u7684Q\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5608\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afATM\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6Q\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4Q\u503c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u8868\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afATM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u65b9\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afATM\u53d8\u4f53\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u3002"}}

Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations.

To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data.

Yet screening agents must master conversational timing, prosody, backchannels, and what to attend to in faces and speech for Depression and PTSD. Most simulators omit policy learning with nonverbal dynamics; many controllers chase task accuracy while underweighting trust, pacing, and rapport. We virtualise the humanoid as a conversational agent to train without hardware burden. Our agent-centred, simulation-first pipeline turns interview data into 276 Unreal Engine MetaHuman patients with synchronised speech, gaze/face, and head-torso poses, plus PHQ-8 and PCL-C flows. A perception-fusion-policy loop decides what and when to speak, when to backchannel, and how to avoid interruptions, under a safety shield. Training uses counterfactual replay (bounded nonverbal perturbations) and an uncertainty-aware turn manager that probes to reduce diagnostic ambiguity. Results are simulation-only; the humanoid is the transfer target. In comparing three controllers, a custom TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG) outperformed PPO and CEM, achieving near-ceiling coverage with steadier pace at comparable rewards. Decision-quality analyses show negligible turn overlap, aligned cut timing, fewer clarification prompts, and shorter waits. Performance stays stable under modality dropout and a renderer swap, and rankings hold on a held-out patient split. Contributions: (1) an agent-centred simulator that turns interviews into 276 interactive patients with bounded nonverbal counterfactuals; (2) a safe learning loop that treats timing and rapport as first-class control variables; (3) a comparative study (TD3 vs PPO/CEM) with clear gains in completeness and social timing; and (4) ablations and robustness analyses explaining the gains and enabling clinician-supervised humanoid pilots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u865a\u62df\u5316\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u8bad\u7ec3\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u786c\u4ef6\u78e8\u635f\uff0cTD3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u78e8\u635f\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u53d7\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u5fc3\u7406\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u9700\u8981\u638c\u63e1\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u6d41\u6280\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65f6\u673a\u3001\u97f5\u5f8b\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5b66\u4e60", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u8bbf\u8c08\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a276\u4e2aUnreal Engine MetaHuman\u865a\u62df\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u6ce8\u89c6/\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u548c\u5934\u8eaf\u5e72\u59ff\u6001\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u611f\u77e5-\u878d\u5408-\u653f\u7b56\u5faa\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u4f55\u65f6\u8bf4\u8bdd\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u5982\u4f55\u907f\u514d\u6253\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5907\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u653e\uff08\u6709\u754c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u6270\u52a8\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56de\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u7cca\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49TD3\uff08Twin Delayed DDPG\uff09\u4f18\u4e8ePPO\u548cCEM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e0a\u9650\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8282\u594f\u3002\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u56de\u5408\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6253\u65ad\u65f6\u673a\u3001\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6f84\u6e05\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\u66f4\u6362\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u60a3\u8005\u96c6\u4e0a\u6392\u540d\u4e00\u81f4", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u865a\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u878d\u6d3d\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u7acb\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bd5\u70b9\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840"}}

This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups.

While recent consistency models offer promising one-step generation for \\textit{unconditional synthesis}, their application to \\textit{conditional enhancement} remains unexplored. We present \\textbf{Consist-Retinex}, the first framework adapting consistency modeling to Retinex-based low-light enhancement. Our key insight is that conditional enhancement requires fundamentally different training dynamics than unconditional generation standard consistency training focuses on low-noise regions near the data manifold, while conditional mapping critically depends on large-noise regimes that bridge degraded inputs to enhanced outputs. We introduce two core innovations: (1) a \\textbf{dual-objective consistency loss} combining temporal consistency with ground-truth alignment under randomized time sampling, providing full-spectrum supervision for stable convergence; and (2) an \\textbf{adaptive noise-emphasized sampling strategy} that prioritizes training on large-noise regions essential for one-step conditional generation. On VE-LOL-L, Consist-Retinex achieves \\textbf{state-of-the-art performance with single-step sampling} (\\textbf{PSNR: 25.51 vs. 23.41, FID: 44.73 vs. 49.59} compared to Diff-Retinex++), while requiring only \\textbf{1/8 of the training budget} relative to the 1000-step Diff-Retinex baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Consist-Retinex\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eRetinex\u4f4e\u5149\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u8c03\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eRetinex\u7684\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u6b65\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eRetinex\u4f4e\u5149\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u6620\u5c04\u4e0e\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConsist-Retinex\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5730\u9762\u771f\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u8c31\u76d1\u7763\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u8c03\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u5355\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728VE-LOL-L\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cConsist-Retinex\u5728\u5355\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff08PSNR: 25.51 vs. 23.41, FID: 44.73 vs. 49.59\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4Diff-Retinex++\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u9700Diff-Retinex\u57fa\u7ebf\uff081000\u6b65\uff091/8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "Consist-Retinex\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u4f4e\u5149\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite these advantages, the coexistence of near-field and far-field effects in hybrid-field channels presents significant challenges for accurate estimation, where traditional methods often struggle to generalize effectively. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on downstream tasks via fine-tuning, aligning with the semantic communication shift toward task-oriented understanding over bit-level accuracy.\n  Motivated by this, we propose Large Language Models for XL-MIMO Channel Estimation (LLM4XCE), a novel channel estimation framework that leverages the semantic modeling capabilities of large language models to recover essential spatial-channel representations for downstream tasks. The model integrates a carefully designed embedding module with Parallel Feature-Spatial Attention, enabling deep fusion of pilot features and spatial structures to construct a semantically rich representation for LLM input. By fine-tuning only the top two Transformer layers, our method effectively captures latent dependencies in the pilot data while ensuring high training efficiency.

This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations.

Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "HSCP\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u548c\u901a\u9053\u526a\u679d\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684RFFI\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHSCP\u5206\u5c42\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6838\u5bf9\u9f50(CKA)\u7684\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u79fb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u5c42\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u76f8\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6d88\u9664\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728UAV-M100\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHSCP\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u9053\u548c\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728ResNet18\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b086.39%\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u548c84.44%FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6bd4\u672a\u526a\u679d\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad81.49%\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u8d8a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HSCP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6RFFI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This enables instance-level interpretability, suppresses noisy or mislabeled samples, and reduces hyperparameter sensitivity.\n  Comprehensive evaluation on 9 data-sets helps to demonstrate that DW-KNN achieves 0.8988 accuracy on average. It ranks 2nd among six methods and within 0.2% of the best-performing Ensemble KNN. It also exhibits the lowest cross-validation variance (0.0156), indicating reliable prediction stability.

RAG-HAR computes lightweight statistical descriptors, retrieves semantically similar samples from a vector database, and uses this contextual evidence to make LLM-based activity identification. We further enhance RAG-HAR by first applying prompt optimization and introducing an LLM-based activity descriptor that generates context-enriched vector databases for delivering accurate and highly relevant contextual information. Along with these mechanisms, RAG-HAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across six diverse HAR benchmarks.

LUMOS introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism that conditions predictions on future known events (e.g., holidays, sales, etc.), enabling the model to predict complex behaviour patterns like \"how will upcoming holidays affect user engagement?\" The architecture also employs multi-modal tokenization, combining user transactions, event context, and static user demographic attributes into rich representations processed through specialized embedding pathways.\n  Through extensive experiments on a production dataset spanning 275 billion user activity tokens from 250 million users, we demonstrate that LUMOS achieves superior performance compared to traditional task-specific models. Across 5 tasks with established baselines, we achieve an average improvement of 0.025 in ROC-AUC for binary classification tasks and 4.6\\% reduction in MAPE for regression tasks.

Just as test-time compute and reasoning have helped language models improve their capabilities, similar benefits have also been observed with image generation models. In particular, searching over noise samples for diffusion and flow models has shown to scale well with test-time compute. While recent works have explored allocating non-uniform inference-compute budgets across different denoising steps, they rely on greedy algorithms and allocate the compute budget ineffectively.

The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process. Finally, a module translates the final plan back into natural language to improve human readability while maintaining the correctness of each step. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across various domains and tasks, including the Google NaturalPlan benchmark and PlanBench, as well as planning problems like Blocksworld and the Tower of Hanoi (where LLMs are known to struggle even with small instances).

Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by antagonistic directional updates where new task gradients directly oppose the historical weight trajectory. To address this, we propose PS-LoRA (Parameter Stability LoRA), a framework designed to resolve conflicts by aligning updates within the optimization subspace.

However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective. This enables 3DID to generate high-fidelity 3D geometries, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and design versatility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa3DID\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u7d223D\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u51e0\u4f55\u751f\u6210", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u75282D\u6295\u5f71\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u73b0\u67093D\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u4f53\u79ef\u7ec6\u8282\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u76843D\u8bbe\u8ba1", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u7406-\u51e0\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7d27\u51d1\u6355\u83b7\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u7269\u7406\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u63a2\u7d22\u5168\u5c40\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u5019\u9009\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5851\u5f62\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u76ee\u6807", "result": "3DID\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76843DID\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5bfc\u822a3D\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u76843D\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u67423D\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Most existing structure-based attacks rely on gradient-based heuristics or local connectivity patterns, and treat edges as equally important candidates for manipulation. In this paper, we propose Spectral Edge Attacks (SEA), a new family of adversarial attacks that explicitly leverage spectral robustness evaluation to guide structural perturbations. Our key idea is to compute a spectral embedding that captures the most fragile directions of the input manifold and to use it to assign a robustness score to each edge or non-edge. Based on these scores, we introduce two complementary attack variants: (i) a Spade-guided deletion attack that removes the most spectrally robust edges, and (ii) a Spade-guided addition attack that inserts edges between nodes that are maximally incompatible in the fragile spectral space.

However, existing MAPF evaluation frameworks typically rely on simplified robot models, leaving a substantial gap between algorithmic benchmarks and practical performance. Recent frameworks such as SMART, incorporate kinodynamic modeling and offer the MAPF community a platform for large-scale, realistic evaluation. Building on this capability, this work investigates how key planner design choices influence performance under realistic execution settings. We systematically study three fundamental factors: (1) the relationship between solution optimality and execution performance, (2) the sensitivity of system performance to inaccuracies in kinodynamic modeling, and (3) the interaction between model accuracy and plan optimality. Empirically, we examine these factors to understand how these design choices affect performance in realistic scenarios.

Existing methods are limited by transfer settings that assume homogeneous domains or heterogeneous scenarios with only co-occurring categories. When label spaces do not overlap, they further rely on complete source-domain coverage and therefore overlook critical target-private information. To overcome these limitations and enable knowledge transfer in fully heterogeneous settings, we propose Cross-scene Knowledge Integration (CKI), a framework that explicitly incorporates target-private knowledge during transfer. CKI includes: (1) Alignment of Spectral Characteristics (ASC) to reduce spectral discrepancies through domain-agnostic projection; (2) Cross-scene Knowledge Sharing Preference (CKSP), which resolves semantic mismatch via a Source Similarity Mechanism (SSM); and (3) Complementary Information Integration (CII) to maximize the use of target-specific complementary cues.

We introduce FIFE, a novel, high-difficulty benchmark designed to assess LM instruction-following capabilities for financial analysis tasks. FIFE comprises 88 human-authored prompts and employs a verification system with chainable, verifiable constraints for fine-grained reward signals. We evaluate 53 models (proprietary, open-weight, open-source) in a zero-shot setting.

The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system. We integrate DWM into a verification pipeline utilizing Star-based reachability analysis (StarV) and employ conformal prediction to derive rigorous statistical bounds on the trajectory deviation between the world model and the actual vision-based system.

Despite their impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, as even minor meaning-preserving changes such as synonym substitutions can lead to incorrect predictions. As a result, certifying the robustness of LLMs against such adversarial prompts is of vital importance. Existing approaches focused on word deletion or simple denoising strategies to achieve robustness certification. However, these methods face two critical limitations: (1) they yield loose robustness bounds due to the lack of semantic validation for perturbed outputs and (2) they suffer from high computational costs due to repeated sampling. To address these limitations, we propose CluCERT, a novel framework for certifying LLM robustness via clustering-guided denoising smoothing. Specifically, to achieve tighter certified bounds, we introduce a semantic clustering filter that reduces noisy samples and retains meaningful perturbations, supported by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we enhance computational efficiency through two mechanisms: a refine module that extracts core semantics, and a fast synonym substitution strategy that accelerates the denoising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and jailbreak defense scenarios.

Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.\n  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-\"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition\"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.\n  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f02\u8d28\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7531\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u4f20\u64ad\u53d7\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6620\u5c04\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u907f\u514d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b58\u6d3b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u3001\u8bef\u89e3\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6d88\u4ea1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f02\u8d28\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u7406\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u5b58\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bd5\u56fe\u7edf\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u548cAI\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5f02\u8d28\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7531\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u4fe1\u5ff5\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5411\u91cf\uff08\u62bd\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4f20\u64ad\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6620\u5c04\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5931\u771f\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u65e0\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u9886\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\"\uff0c\u5c06\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u8868\u5f81\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bf4\u670d\u6216\u6743\u5a01\u3002\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5931\u771f\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u9650\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u7eaf\u4ee3\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u62bd\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u53d8\u5f02\u6216\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8ba4\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u5b58\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u800c\u975e\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u7406\u6027\u4e0a\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5f02\u8d28\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u548cAI\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Inspired by biological systems where structure and function emerge from low-energy configurations, we introduce StructuredDNA, a sparse architecture framework for modular, energy-aware Transformer routing. StructuredDNA replaces dense Mixture-of-Experts routing with a bio-physical, energy-guided routing layer based on semantic energy minimization. Inputs are dynamically grouped into semantic codons, and routing selects a single expert by minimizing a global energy functional that combines cohesion, uncertainty, and computational cost.\n  We validate StructuredDNA on both specialized (BioASQ) and open-domain benchmarks (WikiText-103). On BioASQ (K = 50), we achieve a 97.7% reduction in Energy Utilization Density (EUD) and a Semantic Stability Index (SSI) of 0.998. We further demonstrate a Semantic Scaling Law on WikiText-103, showing that the architecture generalizes to open domains by scaling expert granularity (K = 2048) while maintaining more than 99% energy efficiency. StructuredDNA thus establishes a robust, domain-agnostic paradigm for future sparse computational frameworks.\n  StructuredDNA provides an explicit link between bio-physical principles and sparse expert routing in Transformer architectures, and points toward future energy-aware, modular, and scalable computational systems. We discuss limitations of this proof-of-concept study and outline directions for scaling the approach to larger models, datasets, and hardware platforms.

We evaluate ten cybersecurity professionals alongside six existing AI agents and ARTEMIS, our new agent scaffold, on a large university network consisting of ~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets. ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants. We observe that AI agents offer advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost -- certain ARTEMIS variants cost $18/hour versus $60/hour for professional penetration testers. We also identify key capability gaps: AI agents exhibit higher false-positive rates and struggle with GUI-based tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7406ARTEMIS\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u51fb\u8d259/10\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b09\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u768430%", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22AI\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b", "method": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u7ea68000\u53f0\u4e3b\u673a\u7684\u5927\u5b66\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3010\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u30016\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709AI\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u7684ARTEMIS\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0cARTEMIS\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5206\u7c7b\u529f\u80fd", "result": "ARTEMIS\u603b\u4f53\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b09\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u4ea4\u738782%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e10\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e2d\u76849\u4eba\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u5982Codex\u548cCyAgent\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff1bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u679a\u4e3e\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u5229\u7528\u548c\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf", "conclusion": "AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u548cGUI\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd"}}

Existing supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) approaches suffer from performance instability on known data due to their reliance on limited paired metal-clean data, which limits their clinical applicability. Moreover, existing unsupervised methods face two main challenges: 1) the CT physical geometry is not effectively incorporated into the MAR process to ensure data fidelity; 2) traditional heuristics regularization terms cannot fully capture the abundant prior knowledge available. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose diffusion model regularized implicit neural representation framework for MAR. The implicit neural representation integrates physical constraints and imposes data fidelity, while the pre-trained diffusion model provides prior knowledge to regularize the solution. Experimental results on both simulated and clinical data demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method, highlighting its potential to be applied to clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3CT\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f2a\u5f71\u51cf\u5c11\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5f0fMAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a1) CT\u7269\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u672a\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5165MAR\u8fc7\u7a0b\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u6574\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aCT\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f2a\u5f71\u51cf\u5c11\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN. These consistent gains demonstrate that our proposed methodology to generate defect datasets with pixel-level annotations is feasible for robust AI-based Measurement/Inspection (MI) in semiconductor fabrication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7269\u7406\u6709\u6548\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684AI\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u7eb3\u5236\u9020\u4e2dAI\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5149\u523b\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u532e\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u8150\u8680\u548c\u81a8\u80c0\uff09\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e03\u5c40\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DMD\u5149\u523b\u5236\u9020\u7269\u7406\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7f3a\u9677\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u65e0\u7f3a\u9677\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u663e\u5fae\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b3,530\u5f20\u5149\u5b66\u663e\u5fae\u56fe\u50cf\u300113,365\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u7f3a\u9677\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6865\u63a5\u3001\u6bdb\u523a\u3001\u6536\u7f29\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u56db\u7c7b\u7f3a\u9677\u3002Mask R-CNN\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0a\u7684AP@0.5\u6bd4Faster R-CNN\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u7ea634%\uff0c\u6c61\u67d3\u7c7b\u63d0\u5347\u7ea642%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u6210\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf/\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

By shifting the evaluation from correctness of an- swers to faithfulness of reasoning, CRM reframes visual benchmarks as diagnostic tools, highlighting the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that measure not just performance, but also robustness and fidelity of reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a9\u7801\u533a\u57df\u524d\u540e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684\u3001\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "CRM\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a9\u7801\u524d\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728VisArgs\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCRM\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e00\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4f46\u8bc1\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u5bc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f46\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "CRM\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u4ece\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u8861\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCOPE\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4f46\u727a\u7272\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u671f\u95f4\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u67e5\u8be2LLM\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u672a\u7ecf\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1", "method": "SCOPE\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4ec5\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4ece\u793a\u4f8b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u91cd\u590d\u67e5\u8be2LLM", "result": "\u5728TextCraft\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cSCOPE\u8fbe\u52300.56\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eADaPT\u76840.52\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece164.4\u79d2\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u52303.0\u79d2\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\u3002SCOPE\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3\u91cd\u590dLLM\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027"}}

Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive.\n  We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields.\n  This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system.

Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7f51\u7edc\u95f4\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5-\u8bed\u4e49\u51fd\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u91cf\u6d88\u9664\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e24\u4e2a\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4ece\u8bed\u6cd5\u57df\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u57df\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\uff0c\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u6d88\u9664\u7b97\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u51fd\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\uff08\u7eaf\u8bed\u6cd5\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\uff08\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u6d88\u9664\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7eaf\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u51fd\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6e05\u6670\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u6d88\u9664\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework. LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries.

While isotonic regression has proven effective for binary calibration, its extension to multi-class problems via one-vs-rest calibration produced suboptimal results when compared to parametric methods, limiting its practical adoption. In this work, we propose novel isotonic normalization-aware techniques for multiclass calibration, grounded in natural and intuitive assumptions expected by practitioners. Unlike prior approaches, our methods inherently account for probability normalization by either incorporating normalization directly into the optimization process (NA-FIR) or modeling the problem as a cumulative bivariate isotonic regression (SCIR). Empirical evaluation on a variety of text and image classification datasets across different model architectures reveals that our approach consistently improves negative log-likelihood (NLL) and expected calibration error (ECE) metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u6982\u7387\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6539\u8fdb\u7b49\u6e17\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7b49\u6e17\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u6821\u51c6\uff09\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b49\u6e17\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) NA-FIR\uff1a\u5c06\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u76f4\u63a5\u7eb3\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2) SCIR\uff1a\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7d2f\u79ef\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u7b49\u6e17\u56de\u5f52\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u671f\u671b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u76f4\u89c2\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\uff08NLL\uff09\u548c\u671f\u671b\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff08ECE\uff09\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b49\u6e17\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u7c7b\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The technique of detecting a character in a video is a complex field of study, considering the multitude of objects present in the data under analysis. From the results obtained, we highlight the following, compared to state of the art: In our approach, within the field of Computer Vision, the structuring of supervised learning algorithms allowed us to achieve several successes from simple characteristics of the target character. Our results demonstrate that is new approach allows us to locate, in an efficient way, wanted individuals from a private or public image base.

This study introduces a diffusion-based deep learning (DL) framework that systematically compares three residual prediction strategies differing only in their input sources: (1) a fully data-driven model using only past observations from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, (2) a corrective model using only forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction system, and (3) a hybrid model integrating both MRMS and selected HRRR forecast variables. By evaluating these approaches under a unified setup, we provide a clearer understanding of how each data source contributes to predictive skill over the Continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts are produced at 1-km spatial resolution, beginning with direct 1-hour predictions and extending to 12 hours using autoregressive rollouts. Performance is evaluated using both CONUS-wide and region-specific metrics that assess overall performance and skill at extreme rainfall thresholds. Across all lead times, our DL framework consistently outperforms the HRRR baseline in pixel-wise and spatiostatistical metrics. The hybrid model performs best at the shortest lead time, while the HRRR-corrective model outperforms others at longer lead times, maintaining high skill through 12 hours. To assess reliability, we incorporate calibrated uncertainty quantification tailored to the residual learning setup. These gains, particularly at longer lead times, are critical for emergency preparedness, where modest increases in forecast horizon can improve decision-making. This work advances DL-based precipitation forecasting by enhancing predictive skill, reliability, and applicability across regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6b8b\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7eaf\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u7eafHRRR\u9884\u62a5\u4fee\u6b63\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u57281\u516c\u91cc\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01-12\u5c0f\u65f6\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eHRRR\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u6548\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cHRRR\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u6548\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u5bf9\u6c34\u6587\u6c14\u8c61\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c71\u6d2a\u66b4\u53d1\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u635f\u574f\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u964d\u96e8\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u66f4\u957f\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u6b8b\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528MRMS\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u7eaf\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528HRRR\u6570\u503c\u9884\u62a5\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7ed3\u5408MRMS\u548c\u7cbe\u9009HRRR\u9884\u62a5\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u3002\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u75281\u516c\u91cc\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u76f4\u63a51\u5c0f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u6269\u5c55\u523012\u5c0f\u65f6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6eda\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u4e0a\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8eHRRR\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u77ed\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cHRRR\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f4\u957f\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u572812\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u533a\u57df\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u66f4\u957f\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u4e0a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u5e94\u6025\u51c6\u5907\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002"}}

In event streams, this optical artifact forms a complex, spatio-temporal distortion that has been largely overlooked. We present E-Deflare, the first systematic framework for removing lens flare from event camera data. We first establish the theoretical foundation by deriving a physics-grounded forward model of the non-linear suppression mechanism. This insight enables the creation of the E-Deflare Benchmark, a comprehensive resource featuring a large-scale simulated training set, E-Flare-2.7K, and the first-ever paired real-world test set, E-Flare-R, captured by our novel optical system. Empowered by this benchmark, we design E-DeflareNet, which achieves state-of-the-art restoration performance. Extensive experiments validate our approach and demonstrate clear benefits for downstream tasks.

Understanding neural network OOD generalization is paramount to their successful deployment in experimental workflows, especially when ground-truth knowledge about the experiment is hard to establish or experimental conditions significantly vary. With inherent access to ground-truth information and fine-grained control of underlying distributions, simulation-based data curation facilitates precise investigation of OOD generalization behavior. Here, we probe generalization with respect to imaging conditions of neural network segmentation models for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging of nanoparticles, training and measuring the OOD generalization of over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic data generated via random structure sampling and multislice simulation. Using the HRTEM contrast transfer function, we further develop a framework to compare information content of HRTEM datasets and quantify OOD domain shifts. We demonstrate that neural network segmentation models enjoy significant performance stability, but will smoothly and predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. Lastly, we consider limitations of our approach in explaining other OOD shifts, such as of the atomic structures, and discuss complementary techniques for understanding generalization in such settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d85\u8fc712,000\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86HRTEM\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u5916(OOD)\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u504f\u79bb\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916(OOD)\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u7406\u89e3\u5176OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u6216\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u7ed3\u6784\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u5207\u7247\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d85\u8fc712,000\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eHRTEM\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\u5e76\u91cf\u5316OOD\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u504f\u79bb\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6OOD\u504f\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8865\u5145\u6280\u672f\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u6b64\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Despite predicting occurrence of heatwaves and attributing historical mortality, predicting an incoming deadly heatwave remains a challenge due to the difficulty in defining and estimating heat-related mortality. Furthermore, establishing an early warning system imposes additional requirements, including data availability, spatial and temporal robustness, and decision costs. To address these challenges, we propose DeepTherm, a modular early warning system for deadly heatwave prediction without requiring heat-related mortality history.

LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9488\u5bf9\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u57303D\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u5b9eLiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5efa\u7b51\u4e13\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u5de5\u5730\u5b9e\u9645\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u51713D\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u878d\u5408\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u5de5\u5730\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u3001\u6709\u9650\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f84\u5411\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5730\u9762LiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u91c7\u96c6\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u70b9\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff1aA.\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u3001B.\u65bd\u5de5\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001C.\u5de5\u5730\u5468\u8fb9\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u7ec6\u957f\u4e34\u65f6\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u811a\u624b\u67b6\u3001MEP\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u526a\u5200\u5f0f\u5347\u964d\u673a\uff09\uff0c\u626b\u63cf\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u914d\u6709Git\u4ed3\u5e93\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9002\u914d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5728\u73b0\u4ee33D\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u7559\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u8fdb\u9762\u5411\u5efa\u7b51\u76843D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Using multi-year pollutant and meteorological data, we applied systematic feature selection (correlation, mutual information, mRMR), leakage-safe scaling, and chronological data splits. Both models were trained with pollutant and precursor regressors, with NP additionally leveraging lagged dependencies. For context, two machine learning baselines (LSTM, LightGBM) and one traditional statistical model (SARIMAX) were also implemented. Performance was evaluated on a 7-day holdout using MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. Results show that FBP consistently outperformed NP, SARIMAX, and the learning-based baselines, achieving test $R^2$ above 0.94 for both pollutants.

However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening.

While recent implementations such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) demonstrate high approximation capabilities, they suffer from significant parameter inefficiency due to the requirement of maintaining unique parameterizations for every network edge. In this work, we propose GS-KAN (Generalized Sprecher-KAN), a lightweight architecture inspired by David Sprecher's refinement of the superposition theorem. GS-KAN constructs unique edge functions by applying learnable linear transformations to a single learnable, shared parent function per layer. We evaluate GS-KAN against existing KAN architectures and MLPs across synthetic function approximation, tabular data regression and image classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that GS-KAN outperforms both MLPs and standard KAN baselines on continuous function approximation tasks while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Additionally, GS-KAN achieves competitive performance with existing KAN architectures on tabular regression and outperforms MLPs on high-dimensional classification tasks. Crucially, the proposed architecture enables the deployment of KAN-based architectures in high-dimensional regimes under strict parameter constraints, a setting where standard implementations are typically infeasible due to parameter explosion.

This is a challenging problem because images of the same place may appear quite different for reasons including seasonal changes, weather illumination, structural changes to the environment, as well as transient pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Papers focusing on generating image descriptors for VPR report their results using metrics such as recall@K and ROC curves. However, for a robot implementation, determining which matches are sufficiently good is often reduced to a manually set threshold. And it is difficult to manually select a threshold that will work for a variety of visual scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of automatically selecting a threshold for VPR by looking at the 'negative' Gaussian mixture statistics for a place - image statistics indicating not this place. We show that this approach can be used to select thresholds that work well for a variety of image databases and image descriptors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\"\u8d1f\"\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b(VPR)\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9608\u503c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b(VPR)\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u4e00\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4f1a\u56e0\u5b63\u8282\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u5149\u7167\u3001\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u800c\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u53ec\u56de\u7387@K\u548cROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u5339\u914d\u8db3\u591f\u597d\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u624b\u52a8\u9608\u503c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5730\u70b9\u7684\"\u8d1f\"\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u8868\u793a\"\u975e\u6b64\u5730\"\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9VPR\u9608\u503c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5339\u914d\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u9009\u62e9\u51fa\u5de5\u4f5c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86VPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1f\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VPR\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u9608\u503c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684VPR\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present a unified framework for certified robust attribution that extends from convex models to deep networks. For convex settings, we derive Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions (W-RIF) with provable coverage guarantees. For deep networks, we demonstrate that Euclidean certification is rendered vacuous by spectral amplification -- a mechanism where the inherent ill-conditioning of deep representations inflates Lipschitz bounds by over $10{,}000\\times$. This explains why standard TRAK scores, while accurate point estimates, are geometrically fragile: naive Euclidean robustness analysis yields 0\\% certification. Our key contribution is the Natural Wasserstein metric, which measures perturbations in the geometry induced by the model's own feature covariance. This eliminates spectral amplification, reducing worst-case sensitivity by $76\\times$ and stabilizing attribution estimates. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, Natural W-TRAK certifies 68.7\\% of ranking pairs compared to 0\\% for Euclidean baselines -- to our knowledge, the first non-vacuous certified bounds for neural network attribution.

To address this, we propose AgentComp, a framework that explicitly trains models to better differentiate such compositional variations and enhance their reasoning ability. AgentComp leverages the reasoning and tool-use capabilities of large language models equipped with image generation, editing, and VQA tools to autonomously construct compositional datasets. Using these datasets, we apply an agentic preference optimization method to fine-tune text-to-image models, enabling them to better distinguish between compositionally similar samples and resulting in overall stronger compositional generation ability.

One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths.

To address this, we propose MDSE, Multimodal Disaster Situation Explainer, a novel vision-language framework that automatically generates detailed textual explanations of post-disaster underground scenes. MDSE has three-fold innovations: (i) Context-Aware Cross-Attention for robust alignment of visual and textual features even under severe degradation; (ii) Segmentation-aware dual pathway visual encoding that fuses global and region-specific embeddings; and (iii) Resource-Efficient Transformer-Based Language Model for expressive caption generation with minimal compute cost. To support this task, we present the Underground Mine Disaster (UMD) dataset--the first image-caption corpus of real underground disaster scenes--enabling rigorous training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on UMD and related benchmarks show that MDSE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art captioning models, producing more accurate and contextually relevant descriptions that capture crucial details in obscured environments, improving situational awareness for underground emergency response.

However, the standard trunk design based on fully connected layers acting on raw spatial or spatiotemporal coordinates struggles to represent sharp gradients, boundary layers, and non-periodic structures commonly found in PDEs posed on bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Spectral-Embedded DeepONet (SEDONet), a new DeepONet variant in which the trunk is driven by a fixed Chebyshev spectral dictionary rather than coordinate inputs. This non-periodic spectral embedding provides a principled inductive bias tailored to bounded domains, enabling the learned operator to capture fine-scale non-periodic features that are difficult for Fourier or MLP trunks to represent. SEDONet is evaluated on a suite of PDE benchmarks including 2D Poisson, 1D Burgers, 1D advection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn dynamics, and the Lorenz-96 chaotic system, covering elliptic, parabolic, advective, and multiscale temporal phenomena, all of which can be viewed as canonical problems in computational mechanics. Across all datasets, SEDONet consistently achieves the lowest relative L2 errors among DeepONet, FEDONet, and SEDONet, with average improvements of about 30-40% over the baseline DeepONet and meaningful gains over Fourier-embedded variants on non-periodic geometries. Spectral analyses further show that SEDONet more accurately preserves high-frequency and boundary-localized features, demonstrating the value of Chebyshev embeddings in non-periodic operator learning. The proposed architecture offers a simple, parameter-neutral modification to DeepONets, delivering a robust and efficient spectral framework for surrogate modeling of PDEs on bounded domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSEDONet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u8c31\u5b57\u5178\u800c\u975e\u5750\u6807\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u65b0\u578bDeepONet\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u6709\u754c\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u5468\u671fPDE\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDeepONet\u7684trunk\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u6709\u754c\u57df\u4e0aPDE\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u548c\u975e\u5468\u671f\u7ed3\u6784", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SEDONet\uff0c\u5176trunk\u7531\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u8c31\u5b57\u5178\u9a71\u52a8\u800c\u975e\u5750\u6807\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u975e\u5468\u671f\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u5148\u9a8c", "result": "\u57282D\u6cca\u677e\u30011D Burgers\u30011D\u5bf9\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u3001Allen-Cahn\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548cLorenz-96\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u591a\u4e2aPDE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSEDONet\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f4e\u76f8\u5bf9L2\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfDeepONet\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534730-40%", "conclusion": "\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3a\u975e\u5468\u671f\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0cSEDONet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u6027\u7684DeepONet\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u57dfPDE\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8c31\u6846\u67b6"}}

For instance, the prompt \"egg noodle\" may result in images that incorrectly contain both eggs and noodles as separate entities. Multi-noun food categories are common in real-world datasets and account for a large portion of entries in benchmarks such as UEC-256. These compound names often cause generative models to misinterpret the semantics, producing unintended ingredients or objects. This is due to insufficient multi-noun category related knowledge in the text encoder and misinterpretation of multi-noun relationships, leading to incorrect spatial layouts. To overcome these challenges, we propose FoCULR (Food Category Understanding and Layout Refinement) which incorporates food domain knowledge and introduces core concepts early in the generation process.

While they have shown to work exceptionally well, they are not without issues, resulting in surprising failure modes and predictably asymmetric performance degradation. This article is a study of many of these observed failure modes of transformers through the lens of graph neural network (GNN) theory. We first make the case that much of deep learning, including transformers, is about learnable information mixing and propagation. This makes the study of model failure modes a study of bottlenecks in information propagation. This naturally leads to GNN theory, where there is already a rich literature on information propagation bottlenecks and theoretical failure modes of models. We then make the case that many issues faced by GNNs are also experienced by transformers. In addition, we analyze how the causal nature of decoder-only transformers create interesting geometric properties in information propagation, resulting in predictable and potentially devastating failure modes. Finally, we observe that existing solutions in transformer research tend to be ad-hoc and driven by intuition rather than grounded theoretical motivation.

Existing approaches typically encode camera trajectories through relative or ambiguous representations, limiting explicit geometric control. We introduce GimbalDiffusion, a framework that enables camera control grounded in physical-world coordinates, using gravity as a global reference. Instead of describing motion relative to previous frames, our method defines camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system, allowing precise and interpretable control over camera parameters without requiring an initial reference frame. We leverage panoramic 360-degree videos to construct a wide variety of camera trajectories, well beyond the predominantly straight, forward-facing trajectories seen in conventional video data. To further enhance camera guidance, we introduce null-pitch conditioning, an annotation strategy that reduces the model's reliance on text content when conflicting with camera specifications (e.g., generating grass while the camera points towards the sky). Finally, we establish a benchmark for camera-aware video generation by rebalancing SpatialVID-HQ for comprehensive evaluation under wide camera pitch variation. Together, these contributions advance the controllability and robustness of text-to-video models, enabling precise, gravity-aligned camera manipulation within generative frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "GimbalDiffusion\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u8003\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u4fef\u4ef0\u6761\u4ef6\u51cf\u5c11\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u89c4\u683c\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u5728\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u524d\u4e00\u5e27\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b2. \u5229\u7528\u5168\u666f360\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u4fef\u4ef0\u6761\u4ef6\u6807\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b4. \u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861SpatialVID-HQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5efa\u7acb\u76f8\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u76f4\u7ebf\u3001\u524d\u5411\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u7a7a\u4fef\u4ef0\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u89c4\u683c\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "GimbalDiffusion\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Multiple transcatheter heart valves (THV) have been approved for use in TAVR, but current guidelines regarding valve type prescription remain an active topic of debate. We propose a data-driven clinical support tool to identify the optimal valve type with the objective of minimizing the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), a predominant postoperative complication. We synthesize a novel dataset that combines U.S. and Greek patient populations and integrates three distinct data sources (patient demographics, computed tomography scans, echocardiograms) while harmonizing differences in each country's record system. We introduce a leaf-level analysis to leverage population heterogeneity and avoid benchmarking against uncertain counterfactual risk estimates. The final prescriptive model shows a reduction in PPI rates of 26% and 16% compared with the current standard of care in our internal U.S. population and external Greek validation cohort, respectively.

Such challenges occur in satellite remote sensing, but also with handheld cameras, such as our smartphones. Hence, super-resolution aims to enhance the image resolution algorithmically. Since single-image super-resolution requires solving an inverse problem, such methods must exploit strong priors, e.g. learned from high-resolution training data, or be constrained by auxiliary data, e.g. by a high-resolution guide from another modality. While qualitatively pleasing, such approaches often lead to \"hallucinated\" structures that do not match reality. In contrast, multi-image super-resolution (MISR) aims to improve the (optical) resolution by constraining the super-resolution process with multiple views taken with sub-pixel shifts. Here, we propose SuperF, a test-time optimization approach for MISR that leverages coordinate-based neural networks, also called neural fields. Their ability to represent continuous signals with an implicit neural representation (INR) makes them an ideal fit for the MISR task.\n  The key characteristic of our approach is to share an INR for multiple shifted low-resolution frames and to jointly optimize the frame alignment with the INR. Our approach advances related INR baselines, adopted from burst fusion for layer separation, by directly parameterizing the sub-pixel alignment as optimizable affine transformation parameters and by optimizing via a super-sampled coordinate grid that corresponds to the output resolution. Our experiments yield compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras, with upsampling factors of up to 8. A key advantage of SuperF is that this approach does not rely on any high-resolution training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5e27\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b08\u500d\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u53d7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u3001\u5927\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\"\u5e7b\u89c9\"\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u91cd\u5efa\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSuperF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u4e9a\u50cf\u7d20\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e27\u5171\u4eab\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5e27\u5bf9\u9f50\u548cINR\uff1b3\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e9a\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e3a\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u53c2\u6570\uff1b4\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5e94\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u8d85\u91c7\u6837\u5750\u6807\u7f51\u683c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u624b\u6301\u76f8\u673a\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6a21\u62dfburst\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8fbe8\u500d\u7684\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u5173\u952e\u4f18\u52bf\u662f\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u4f55\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "SuperF\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u548c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045). The AUC for detecting FFR <= 0.80 was 0.93, with sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.86. The pipeline completed fully automatically in 93 percent of vessels, with median time to result 41 s.

However, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is hindered by substantial computational and memory overhead, primarily stemming from higher-order automatic differentiation, intensive tensor operations, and reliance on full-precision arithmetic. To address these challenges, we present a framework that enables scalable and energy-efficient PINN training on edge devices. This framework integrates fully quantized training, Stein's estimator (SE)-based residual loss computation, and tensor-train (TT) decomposition for weight compression. It contributes three key innovations: (1) a mixed-precision training method that use a square-block MX (SMX) format to eliminate data duplication during backpropagation; (2) a difference-based quantization scheme for the Stein's estimator that mitigates underflow; and (3) a partial-reconstruction scheme (PRS) for TT-Layers that reduces quantization-error accumulation. We further design PINTA, a precision-scalable hardware accelerator, to fully exploit the performance of the framework. Experiments on the 2-D Poisson, 20-D Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB), and 100-D Heat equations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision, uncompressed baselines while delivering 5.5x to 83.5x speedups and 159.6x to 2324.1x energy savings.

However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical verification through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that our method can surpass existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep regression methods.

We initiate the study of such intent inference using a variant of a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF), subject to the assumption that the agent's intent manifests through closed-loop behavior with a state-of-the-art provable practical stability property. Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample. We quantify how well the adversary can recover the agent's intent using information-theoretic leakage metrics and provide computable lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true intent distribution and RBPF estimates via Gaussian-mixture KL bounds. We also provide a bound on the difference in performance between the two estimators, highlighting the fact that the reduced estimator performs almost as well as the complete one.

Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization.

Accepted at MCSoC 2025", "summary": "The continuous scaling of deep neural networks has fundamentally transformed machine learning, with larger models demonstrating improved performance across diverse tasks. This growth in model size has dramatically increased the computational resources required for the training process. Consequently, distributed approaches, such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, have become essential paradigms for scalable deployment. However, existing Split Learning approaches assume client homogeneity and uniform split points across all participants. This critically limits their applicability to real-world IoT systems where devices exhibit heterogeneity in computational resources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Hetero-SplitEE, a novel method that enables heterogeneous IoT devices to train a shared deep neural network in parallel collaboratively. By integrating heterogeneous early exits into hierarchical training, our approach allows each client to select distinct split points (cut layers) tailored to its computational capacity. In addition, we propose two cooperative training strategies, the Sequential strategy and the Averaging strategy, to facilitate this collaboration among clients with different split points. The Sequential strategy trains clients sequentially with a shared server model to reduce computational overhead. The Averaging strategy enables parallel client training with periodic cross-layer aggregation.

While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $\u0394$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching.

The acquired representations from SSL have demonstrated useful for many downstream tasks including clustering, and linear classification, etc. To ensure smoothness of the representation space, most SSL methods rely on the ability to generate pairs of observations that are similar to a given instance. However, generating these pairs may be challenging for many types of data. Moreover, these methods lack consideration of uncertainty quantification and can perform poorly in out-of-sample prediction settings. To address these limitations, we propose Gaussian process self supervised learning (GPSSL), a novel approach that utilizes Gaussian processes (GP) models on representation learning. GP priors are imposed on the representations, and we obtain a generalized Bayesian posterior minimizing a loss function that encourages informative representations. The covariance function inherent in GPs naturally pulls representations of similar units together, serving as an alternative to using explicitly defined positive samples. We show that GPSSL is closely related to both kernel PCA and VICReg, a popular neural network-based SSL method, but unlike both allows for posterior uncertainties that can be propagated to downstream tasks. Experiments on various datasets, considering classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that GPSSL outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and error control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGPSSL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6837\u672c\u5916\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08GPSSL\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u65bd\u52a0\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u83b7\u5f97\u5e7f\u4e49\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5229\u7528GP\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u51fd\u6570\u81ea\u7136\u62c9\u8fd1\u76f8\u4f3c\u5355\u5143\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "GPSSL\u4e0e\u6838PCA\u548cVICReg\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u540e\u9a8c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cGPSSL\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GPSSL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684VLM x SI\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c063D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5916\u90e8\u5316\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u8ba9VLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bbf\u95ee\u5fc5\u8981\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c3D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c063D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9002\u5408VLM\u5904\u7406\u7684\u590d\u5408\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u5982\u6307\u5b9a\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u6216\u5e26\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4f7fVLM\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faView-on-Graph\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u5c42\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u8ba9VLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u904d\u5386\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bbf\u95ee\u5fc5\u8981\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "VoG\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c3D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u573a\u666f\u63a2\u7d22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u96f6\u6837\u672c3DVG\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM x SI\u8303\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u5c063D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5916\u90e8\u5316\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u964d\u4f4eVLM\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family.

While standard Message-Passing GNNs (MPNNs) are efficient, they theoretically lack the expressive power to fully represent MILP structures. Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8282\u70b9\u951a\u5b9a\u5b50\u56feGNN\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0O(n)\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u6162\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8d85\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5206\u652f\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012GNN\uff08\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u9636GNN\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6298\u8877\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u951a\u5b9a\u5b50\u56feGNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u95f4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4f4e\u4e8e3-WL\u4f46\u8db3\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8282\u70b9\u951a\u5b9a\u5b50\u56feGNN\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5176O(n)\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u6bd4MPNN\u53ca\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6162\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8eMILP\u5206\u652f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027GNN\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u76ee\u524d\u8d85\u8fc7\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Owing to its substantial contribution to worldwide morbidity and mortality, the development of reliable and efficient diagnostic approaches is critically important to facilitate early detection and prompt clinical management. This study presents a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for early CKD detection from CT kidney images, complemented by class balancing using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and interpretability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM).

This study develops a forecasting framework that leverages the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) MasterFormat as the target data structure, enabling predictions at the six-digit section level and supporting detailed cost projections across a wide spectrum of building materials. To enhance predictive accuracy, the framework integrates explanatory variables such as raw material prices, commodity indexes, and macroeconomic indicators. Four time-series models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Chronos-Bolt, were evaluated under both baseline configurations (using CSI data only) and extended versions with explanatory variables. Results demonstrate that incorporating explanatory variables significantly improves predictive performance across all models. Among the tested approaches, the LSTM model consistently achieved the highest accuracy, with RMSE values as low as 1.390 and MAPE values of 0.957, representing improvements of up to 59\\% over the traditional statistical time-series model, ARIMA. Validation across multiple CSI divisions confirmed the framework's scalability, while Division 06 (Wood, Plastics, and Composites) is presented in detail as a demonstration case.

We propose OmniPSD, a unified diffusion framework built upon the Flux ecosystem that enables both text-to-PSD generation and image-to-PSD decomposition through in-context learning. For text-to-PSD generation, OmniPSD arranges multiple target layers spatially into a single canvas and learns their compositional relationships through spatial attention, producing semantically coherent and hierarchically structured layers. For image-to-PSD decomposition, it performs iterative in-context editing, progressively extracting and erasing textual and foreground components to reconstruct editable PSD layers from a single flattened image. An RGBA-VAE is employed as an auxiliary representation module to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning.

However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions. Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions.

However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\\textbf{G}lacial \\textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \\textbf{C}ontextual \\textbf{I}nstance \\textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66).

Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains.

Comprehensive evaluations across five datasets and two popular tasks-object detection and instance segmentation-demonstrate up to a 44.10% reduction in bitrate without compromising end-task accuracy, along with an 8.88 % improvement in accuracy at the same bitrate compared to the state-of-the-art Versatile Video Coding (VVC) codec standardized by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG).", "AI": {"tldr": "ROI-Packing\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5173\u952e\u7684\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u6253\u5305\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u80fd\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "ROI-Packing\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5173\u952e\u7684\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u9ad8\u6548\u6253\u5305\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c2\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u76f8\u6bd4MPEG\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6700\u65b0VVC\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0cROI-Packing\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8644.10%\uff1b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868.88%\u3002", "conclusion": "ROI-Packing\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Single-Call LLM Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning over both structured and unstructured knowledge. When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability.

However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoRel\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u53cc\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u76844D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u65f6\u57df\u95ea\u70c1\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u65f6\u57df\u95ea\u70c1\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0/\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u951a\u70b9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u53cc\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u951a\u70b9\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u53cc\u5411\u53d8\u5f62\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u81f4\u5bc6\u5316\u65b9\u6848", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u5efa\u7684SelfCapLR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMoRel\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65f6\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u65e0\u95ea\u70c1\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b4D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u754c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "MoRel\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u65f6\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53cc\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5e7f\u4e49Radon\u548c\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d8\u6362\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u6781\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u906d\u53d7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\u57df\u6216\u4e0d\u4f20\u64ad\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u692d\u5706\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u6ce2\u3001\u5bf9\u6d41\u3001\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u672a\u77e5\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u53cc\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u51e0\u4f55\u79ef\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8bef\u5dee\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u4ee3\u6570\uff08\u5feb\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e42\u6b21\u5012\u6570\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53cc\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u7c7b\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0d\u4f1a\u906d\u53d7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u8870\u51cf\u8d85\u4ee3\u6570\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ece\u6781\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53cc\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, the existing T2I alignment benchmarks predominantly focus on short prompt scenarios and only provide MOS or Likert scale annotations. This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models. Based on LongT2IBench, we further propose LongT2IExpert, a LongT2I evaluator that enables multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to provide both quantitative scores and structured interpretations through an instruction-tuning process with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LongT2IExpert in alignment evaluation and interpretation.

It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead. Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle edge caching scheme has good robustness to variations in vehicle speed, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving cache hit percentage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b(LDPM)\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u84b8\u998f\u8f85\u52a9\u8f66\u8f86\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u79fb\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u8f66\u8f86\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f13\u5b58\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8f66\u8f86\u7528\u6237\u8bbf\u95ee\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7528\u6237\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u5185\u5bb9\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u8f66\u8f86\u53ef\u80fd\u79bb\u5f00RSU\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5931\u8d25", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b(LDPM)\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u84b8\u998f\u8f85\u52a9\u8f66\u8f86\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u4f20\u8f93\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LDPM\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u5bb9\u9884\u6d4b", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLDPM\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u84b8\u998f\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5185\u5bb9\u9884\u6d4b"}}

We develop a multimodal facial expression analysis network to extract expression intensity features during patients' performance of various facial expressions. This network leverages the CLIP architecture to integrate visual and textual features while preserving the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Subsequently, the expression intensity features are processed and input into an LSTM-based classification network for PD diagnosis.

While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360\u00b0 scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model. We demonstrate that our method achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360\u00b0 scenes than existing methods, and validate its superior color diversity using a novel Color Diversity Index.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLoGoColor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\u6d88\u96642D\u56fe\u50cf\u7740\u8272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u76843D\u7740\u8272\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u901a\u90533D\u91cd\u5efa\u7f3a\u4e4f\u989c\u8272\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u73b0\u67093D\u7740\u8272\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f2D\u56fe\u50cf\u7740\u8272\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u989c\u8272\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u5355\u8c03\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoGoColor\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\"\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\"\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5b50\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u5b50\u573a\u666f\u95f4\u548c\u5b50\u573a\u666f\u5185\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u6307\u5bfc\u5e73\u5747\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742360\u00b0\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u76843D\u7740\u8272\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u989c\u8272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u989c\u8272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LoGoColor\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u6307\u5bfc\u5e73\u5747\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u67093D\u7740\u8272\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u989c\u8272\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7740\u8272\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Prior work on model extraction has focused on classification models or memorization leakage, leaving the vulnerability of safety-aligned generative medical LLMs underexplored.\n  We present a black-box distillation attack that replicates the domain-specific reasoning of safety-aligned medical LLMs using only output-level access. By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks. We also propose a layered defense system, as a prototype detector for real-time alignment drift in black-box deployments.\n  Our findings show that benign-only black-box distillation exposes a practical and under-recognized threat: adversaries can cheaply replicate medical LLM capabilities while stripping safety mechanisms, underscoring the need for extraction-aware safety monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u84b8\u998f\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u51fa\u8bbf\u95ee\u5c31\u80fd\u590d\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5265\u79bb\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u529f\u80fd-\u4f26\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u533b\u7597\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u533b\u7597\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ed1\u76d2\u84b8\u998f\u653b\u51fb\uff1a1) \u5411Meditron-7B\u53d1\u51fa48,000\u6761\u6307\u4ee4\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6536\u96c625,000\u4e2a\u826f\u6027\u6307\u4ee4-\u54cd\u5e94\u5bf9\uff1b2) \u5728\u96f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03LLaMA3 8B\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u6709\u5bb3\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u6790\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u82b1\u8d3912\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u826f\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u572886%\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85Meditron-7B(66%)\u548c\u672a\u8c03\u4f18\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(46%)\u3002\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u7684\u529f\u80fd-\u4f26\u7406\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u8f6c\u79fb\u800c\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u826f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u84b8\u998f\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u4e14\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8ba4\u8bc6\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ec9\u4ef7\u590d\u5236\u533b\u7597\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u540c\u65f6\u5265\u79bb\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u63d0\u53d6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u539f\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002"}}

In this work, we find that the data mixture proportions from different restoration tasks are also a critical factor directly determining the overall performance of all-in-one image restoration models. To this end, we propose a high-capacity diffusion-based image restoration foundation model, FoundIR-v2, which adopts a data equilibrium scheduling paradigm to dynamically optimize the proportions of mixed training datasets from different tasks. By leveraging the data mixing law, our method ensures a balanced dataset composition, enabling the model to achieve consistent generalization and comprehensive performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an effective Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven scheduler into generative pre-training to flexibly allocate task-adaptive diffusion priors for each restoration task, accounting for the distinct degradation forms and levels exhibited by different tasks.

However, existing regularizers are built on heterogeneous distance measures and design choices, which makes their behavior hard to reason about and their performance inconsistent across tasks. This raises a basic question: what properties make a good fairness regularizer? We address this question by first organizing existing in-process methods into three families: (i) matching prediction statistics across sensitive groups, (ii) aligning latent representations, and (iii) directly minimizing dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes. Through this lens, we identify desirable properties of the underlying distance measure, including tight generalization bounds, robustness to scale differences, and the ability to handle arbitrary prediction distributions. Motivated by these properties, we propose a Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) fairness regularizer that penalizes the empirical CS divergence between prediction distributions conditioned on sensitive groups. Under a Gaussian comparison, we show that CS divergence yields a tighter bound than Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and the mean disparity used in Demographic Parity, and we discuss how these advantages translate to a distribution-free, kernel-based estimator that naturally extends to multiple sensitive attributes. Extensive experiments on four tabular benchmarks and one image dataset demonstrate that the proposed CS regularizer consistently improves Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy, and achieves a more stable utility-fairness trade-off across hyperparameter settings compared to prior regularizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u67ef\u897f-\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4ec0\u4e48\u7279\u6027\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff1a\u5339\u914d\u9884\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u60f3\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u67ef\u897f-\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684CS\u6563\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCS\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u548c\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6548\u7528-\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "CS\u6563\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u9650\u3001\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We present MelanomaNet, an explainable deep learning system for multi-class skin lesion classification that addresses this gap through four complementary interpretability mechanisms. Our approach combines an EfficientNet V2 backbone with GradCAM++ attention visualization, automated ABCDE clinical criterion extraction, Fast Concept Activation Vectors (FastCAV) for concept-based explanations, and Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty quantification. We evaluate our system on the ISIC 2019 dataset containing 25,331 dermoscopic images across 9 diagnostic categories. Our model achieves 85.61% accuracy with a weighted F1 score of 0.8564, while providing clinically meaningful explanations that align model attention with established dermatological assessment criteria. The uncertainty quantification module decomposes prediction confidence into epistemic and aleatoric components, enabling automatic flagging of unreliable predictions for clinical review. Our results demonstrate that high classification performance can be achieved alongside comprehensive interpretability, potentially facilitating greater trust and adoption in clinical dermatology workflows.

Standard practice assumes that balancing subgroup representation optimises performance. However, recent empirical results contradict this assumption: in some cases, imbalanced data distributions actually improve subgroup performance, while in others, subgroup performance remains unaffected by the absence of an entire subgroup during training. We conduct a systematic study of subgroup allocation across four vision and language models, varying training data composition to characterise the sensitivity of subgroup performance to data balance. We propose the latent separation hypothesis, which states that a partially fine-tuned model's dependence on subgroup representation is determined by the degree of separation between subgroups in the latent space of the pre-trained model. We formalise this hypothesis, provide theoretical analysis, and validate it empirically. Finally, we present a practical application to foundation model fine-tuning, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of latent subgroup separation can inform data collection and balancing decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u5047\u8bf4\"\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b50\u7fa4\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u7fa4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u7fa4\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u671f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53cd\u800c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5b50\u7fa4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u65f6\u5373\u4f7f\u5b8c\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\u67d0\u4e2a\u5b50\u7fa4\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e5f\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u77db\u76fe\u73b0\u8c61\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5b50\u7fa4\u5206\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "1. \u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u6210\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u5b50\u7fa4\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\"\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u5047\u8bf4\"\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5b50\u7fa4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7531\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b50\u7fa4\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b3. \u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8be5\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b4. \u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7fa4\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5982\u4f55\u6307\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b50\u7fa4\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u786e\u5b9e\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b50\u7fa4\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5f53\u5b50\u7fa4\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u7fa4\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u5f53\u5b50\u7fa4\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91cd\u53e0\u8f83\u591a\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u5047\u8bf4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u5047\u8bbe\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b50\u7fa4\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u660e\u667a\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/SonghanWu/yolov8n-SPTS", "summary": "This paper focuses on the key issue in autonomous driving: small target recognition in dynamic perception. Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset show that YOLOv8n-SPTS model ranks first in precision (61.9%), recall (48.3%), mAP@0.5 (52.6%), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (32.6%).

While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability.

Extensive experiments confirm the superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

However, progress in sleep foundation models is hindered by two key limitations: (1) the lack of a shared dataset and benchmark with diverse tasks for training and evaluation, and (2) the absence of a systematic evaluation of SSRL approaches across sleep-related tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation.

Despite extensive research on learning with noisy labels (LNL), the robustness of existing methods in medical imaging has not been systematically assessed. To address this gap, we introduce LNMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for Label Noise in Medical imaging. LNMBench encompasses \\textbf{10} representative methods evaluated across 7 datasets, 6 imaging modalities, and 3 noise patterns, establishing a unified and reproducible framework for robustness evaluation under realistic conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the performance of existing LNL methods degrades substantially under high and real-world noise, highlighting the persistent challenges of class imbalance and domain variability in medical data. Motivated by these findings, we further propose a simple yet effective improvement to enhance model robustness under such conditions.

Maxwell"], "title": "Log NeRF: Comparing Spaces for Learning Radiance Fields", "comment": "The 36th British Machine Vision Conference", "summary": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis, typically using sRGB images for supervision. However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728NeRF\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6570RGB\u8272\u5f69\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfsRGB\u6216\u7ebf\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528sRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u53d7\u53cc\u5149\u6e90\u4e8c\u8272\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u53d8\u6362\u80fd\u7b80\u5316\u5149\u7167\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u6570RGB\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u8ba9NeRF\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5916\u89c2\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GoPro\u76f8\u673a\u91c7\u96c6\u7ea630\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u7f16\u7801\u786e\u4fdd\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8272\u5f69\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u91ca\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u3001sRGB\u3001GPLog\u3001\u5bf9\u6570RGB\uff09\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3NeRF\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u8272\u5f69\u7a7a\u95f4\u540e\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u635f\u5931\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8272\u5f69\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6570RGB\u8272\u5f69\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u5176\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u4f4d\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u548cNeRF\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6570RGB\u8272\u5f69\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3aNeRF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6e32\u67d3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy. More importantly, it delivers up to 44.1\\% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions. This effectively mitigates the stiffness problem and provides a practical, high-fidelity audio-driven solution for interactive digital humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniLS\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bf4-\u542c\u8868\u60c5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u8f68\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u542c\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u542c\u8005\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u548c\u542c\u8005\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u8bf4\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u542c\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u9762\u4e34\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u542c\u8005\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u9075\u5faa\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ec5\u53d7\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u97f3\u677e\u6563\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f4\u63a5\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea7\u751f\u50f5\u786c\u3001\u9759\u6001\u7684\u542c\u8005\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniLS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7136\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u8f68\u97f3\u9891\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u97f3\u7ebf\u7d22\u8c03\u5236\u5df2\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "UniLS\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u5728\u542c\u8005\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe44.1%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u3001\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u542c\u8005\u8868\u60c5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u50f5\u786c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "UniLS\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8f68\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7edf\u4e00\u8bf4-\u542c\u8868\u60c5\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training. Our results suggest DI as a promising direction for copyright protection and dataset accountability in the era of large audio generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a8\u65ad\uff08\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8bc1\u636e\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u7d27\u8feb\u7684\u7248\u6743\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u827a\u672f\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u6750\u6599\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u5305\u542b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7248\u6743\u6301\u6709\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u62a4\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIA\uff09\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u786e\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u97f3\u9891\u6837\u672c\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a8\u65ad\uff08DI\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6210\u5458\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f88\u5f31\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a8\u65ad\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u9886\u57df\u662f\u6210\u529f\u7684\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a8\u65ad\u662f\u5728\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4ee3\u8fdb\u884c\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95ee\u8d23\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6210\u5458\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have been employed to reconstruct the avatars. However, they often produce unsatisfactory photo-realistic results because of insufficient geometrical details related to body motion, such as clothing wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues. Furthermore, we present a new multi-view dataset with varied lighting conditions to evaluate relight. Our framework enables realistic rendering of novel poses and views while supporting photo-realistic lighting effects under arbitrary lighting conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, novel pose rendering, and relighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRnD-Avatar\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u548c\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8499\u76ae\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6355\u6349\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eNeRF\u548c3DGS\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u56e0\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u5982\u8863\u7269\u8936\u76b1\uff09\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4ee4\u4eba\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u6548\u679c", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRnD-Avatar\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8499\u76ae\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u59ff\u6001\u5b9a\u4e49\u4eba\u4f53\u5173\u8282\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u989d\u5916\u53d8\u5f62\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b3) \u521b\u5efa\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5149\u7167\u6570\u636e\u96c6", "result": "\u80fd\u591f\u771f\u5b9e\u6e32\u67d3\u65b0\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u3001\u65b0\u59ff\u6001\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RnD-Avatar\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8499\u76ae\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u548c\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02"}}

By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power.

As current state-of-the-art methods based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still suffer from the issue of differentiating classes across learning tasks. Here a novel VLM-based continual learning framework for image classification is proposed. In this framework, task-specific adapters are added to the pre-trained and frozen image encoder to learn new knowledge, and a novel cross-task representation calibration strategy based on a mixture of light-weight projectors is used to help better separate all learned classes in a unified feature space, alleviating class confusion across tasks. In addition, a novel inference strategy guided by prediction uncertainty is developed to more accurately select the most appropriate image feature for class prediction.

In this work, we propose TextGuider, a novel training-free method that encourages accurate and complete text appearance by aligning textual content tokens and text regions in the image.

Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

However, applying these models to long-video understanding remains computationally intensive. Dense frame encoding generates excessive visual tokens, leading to high memory consumption, redundant computation, and limited scalability in real-world applications. This inefficiency highlights a key limitation of the traditional process-then-reason paradigm, which analyzes visual streams exhaustively before semantic reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-QTR (Query-Driven Temporal Reasoning), a lightweight framework that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided reasoning process. Instead of encoding every frame, Video-QTR dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks: MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME demonstrate that Video-QTR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%.

However, existing agents are typically confined to static, predefined action spaces--such as exclusively using APIs, GUI events, or robotic commands. This rigidity limits their adaptability in dynamic environments where the optimal granularity of interaction varies contextually. To bridge this gap, we propose CrossAgent, a unified agentic model that masters heterogeneous action spaces and autonomously selects the most effective interface for each step of a trajectory. We introduce a comprehensive training pipeline that integrates cold-start supervised fine-tuning with a Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn adaptive action switching--balancing high-level efficiency with low-level precision--without human-specified rules. Extensive experiments on over 800 tasks in the open-world Minecraft environment demonstrate that CrossAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance. By dynamically leveraging the strengths of diverse action spaces, our model significantly outperforms fixed-action baselines, exhibiting superior generalization and efficiency in long-horizon reasoning.

Building on our previously proposed privacy-preserving framework, this paper presents its first comprehensive validation on real-world data collected directly by industrial partners in active production environments. We evaluate the framework across three representative use cases: woodworking production monitoring, human-aware AGV navigation, and multi-camera ergonomic risk assessment. The approach employs learned visual transformations that obscure sensitive or task-irrelevant information while retaining features essential for task performance. Through both quantitative evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off and qualitative feedback from industrial partners, we assess the framework's effectiveness, deployment feasibility, and trust implications.

To address this challenge, we present StereoWorld, an end-to-end framework that repurposes a pretrained video generator for high-fidelity monocular-to-stereo video generation. Our framework jointly conditions the model on the monocular video input while explicitly supervising the generation with a geometry-aware regularization to ensure 3D structural fidelity. A spatio-temporal tiling scheme is further integrated to enable efficient, high-resolution synthesis. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate a high-definition stereo video dataset containing over 11M frames aligned to natural human interpupillary distance (IPD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoWorld substantially outperforms prior methods, generating stereo videos with superior visual fidelity and geometric consistency.

Since the communication overhead of loading this small number of activated experts into RAM during inference is negligible, expert parameters can be offloaded to storage, making MoLE suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Existing Vision Transformer(ViT)-based time-series reconstruction methods, like SMTS-ViT, often employ coarse temporal embeddings that aggregate entire sequences, causing substantial information loss and reducing reconstruction accuracy. To address these limitations, a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)-based framework with temporal-spatial fusion embedding for MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered regions is proposed in this study. Non-overlapping tubelets are extracted via 3D convolution with constrained temporal span $(t=2)$, ensuring local temporal coherence while reducing cross-day information degradation. Both MSI-only and SAR-MSI fusion scenarios are considered during the experiments. Comprehensive experiments on 2020 Traill County data demonstrate notable performance improvements: MTS-ViViT achieves a 2.23\\% reduction in MSE compared to the MTS-ViT baseline, while SMTS-ViViT achieves a 10.33\\% improvement with SAR integration over the SMTS-ViT baseline.

Current methods struggle with generalization due to the scarce annotated 3D scene data or noisy 2D segmentations. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solution, existing 3D scene synthesis methods fail to simultaneously satisfy geometry diversity, context complexity, and layout reasonability, each essential for this task. To address these needs, we propose an Adapted 3D Scene Synthesis pipeline for class-agnostic 3D Instance SegmenTation, termed as ASSIST-3D, to synthesize proper data for model generalization enhancement. Specifically, ASSIST-3D features three key innovations, including 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection from extensive 3D CAD asset collections, incorporating randomness in object sampling to maximize geometric and contextual diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation through LLM-guided spatial reasoning combined with depth-first search for reasonable object placements; and 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D image rendering and fusion from the synthetic scenes, closely mimicking real-world sensor data acquisition. Experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with ASSIST-3D-generated data significantly outperform existing methods. Further comparisons underscore the superiority of our purpose-built pipeline over existing 3D scene synthesis approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASSIST-3D\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u65e0\u51733D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u5bf9\u8c61\u9009\u62e9\u3001LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u70b9\u4e91\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7c7b\u65e0\u51733D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u771f\u5b9e3D\u573a\u666f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u62162D\u5206\u5272\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3002\u73b0\u67093D\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u51e0\u4f55\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u5408\u7406\u6027\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "ASSIST-3D\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D CAD\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e93\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u6784\u5bf9\u8c61\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB-D\u56fe\u50cf\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u5b9e\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScanNetV2\u3001ScanNet++\u548cS3DIS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ASSIST-3D\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6bd4\u8f83\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u4e13\u7528\u7ba1\u9053\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ASSIST-3D\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7c7b\u65e0\u51733D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3002"}}

This work explores how color is encoded in a generative model through a systematic analysis of the latent representations in Stable Diffusion. Through controlled synthetic datasets, principal component analysis (PCA) and similarity metrics, we reveal that color information is encoded along circular, opponent axes predominantly captured in latent channels c_3 and c_4, whereas intensity and shape are primarily represented in channels c_1 and c_2.

This paper proposes FUSER, the first feed-forward multiview registration transformer that jointly processes all scans in a unified, compact latent space to directly predict global poses without any pairwise estimation. To maintain tractability, FUSER encodes each scan into low-resolution superpoint features via a sparse 3D CNN that preserves absolute translation cues, and performs efficient intra- and inter-scan reasoning through a Geometric Alternating Attention module. Particularly, we transfer 2D attention priors from off-the-shelf foundation models to enhance 3D feature interaction and geometric consistency. Building upon FUSER, we further introduce FUSER-DF, an SE(3)$^N$ diffusion refinement framework to correct FUSER's estimates via denoising in the joint SE(3)$^N$ space. FUSER acts as a surrogate multiview registration model to construct the denoiser, and a prior-conditioned SE(3)$^N$ variational lower bound is derived for denoising supervision. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and ArkitScenes demonstrate that our approach achieves the superior registration accuracy and outstanding computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "FUSER\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u524d\u9988\u5f0f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6Transformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u5168\u5c40\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6210\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\uff1bFUSER-DF\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7SE(3)^N\u6269\u6563\u7cbe\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6821\u6b63\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6210\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\u6784\u5efa\u4f4d\u59ff\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6574\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) FUSER\uff1a\u7a00\u758f3D CNN\u5c06\u626b\u63cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u7edd\u5bf9\u5e73\u79fb\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8d85\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u4ea4\u66ff\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u626b\u63cf\u5185\u548c\u626b\u63cf\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u75282D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5148\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a3D\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b2) FUSER-DF\uff1aSE(3)^N\u6269\u6563\u7cbe\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5FUSER\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684SE(3)^N\u53d8\u5206\u4e0b\u754c\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u566a\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u57283DMatch\u3001ScanNet\u548cArkitScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "FUSER\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u9988\u5f0f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u5168\u5c40\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6210\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff1bFUSER-DF\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u7cbe\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u914d\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training. Experimental validation on the CIGRE 18-bus distribution system shows that this embedding-loss approach achieves low prediction errors, with bus voltage MSEs of 6.92e-07 (GCN), 1.21e-06 (GAT), 3.29e-05 (GPS), and 9.04e-07 (SAGE).

This work presents a deep learning framework that predicts polymer solubility, expressed as weight percent (wt%), directly from SMILES representations of both polymers and solvents. A dataset of 8,049 polymer solvent pairs at 25 deg C was constructed from calibrated molecular dynamics simulations (Zhou et al., 2023), and molecular descriptors and fingerprints were combined into a 2,394 feature representation per sample.

On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540cVision Transformers\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfCNNs\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u5206\u5c42Transformer\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800cVision Transformers\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5168\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578bViT\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u7eafTransformer\u3001\u5206\u5c42Transformer\u548c\u6df7\u5408Transformer\uff08\u5982Swin\u3001CvT\uff09\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0cCOCO\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cChestX-ray14\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u5206\u5c42Transformer\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fSwin\u548cCvT\uff09\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5728\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0cSwin Transformer\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002Vision Transformers\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "Vision Transformers\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u6298\u8877\u3002"}}

Currently, sRGB-based WB editing for post-ISP WB correction is widely used to address color constancy failures in the ISP pipeline when the original camera RAW is unavailable. However, additive color models (e.g., sRGB) are inherently limited by fixed nonlinear transformations and entangled color channels, which often impede their generalization to complex lighting conditions.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for WB correction that leverages a perception-inspired Learnable HSI (LHSI) color space. Built upon a cylindrical color model that naturally separates luminance from chromatic components, our framework further introduces dedicated parameters to enhance this disentanglement and learnable mapping to adaptively refine the flexibility. Moreover, a new Mamba-based network is introduced, which is tailored to the characteristics of the proposed LHSI color space.\n  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the potential of perception-inspired color space design in computational photography.

There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making.\n  Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors.\n  Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926). The multimodal ensemble integrating all components achieved the best overall performance (AUC 0.9407; 95\\% CI, 0.930--0.951) and produced anatomically meaningful localization maps consistent with known SDH patterns.\n  Interpretation. This multimodal, interpretable framework provides rapid and accurate SDH detection and localization, achieving high detection performance and offering transparent, anatomically grounded outputs. Integration into radiology workflows could streamline triage, reduce time to intervention, and improve consistency in SDH management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u548cCT\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786c\u819c\u4e0b\u8840\u80bf\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u786c\u819c\u4e0b\u8840\u80bf\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u6025\u75c7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u900f\u660e\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u5f71\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\u30013D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8eCT\u4f53\u79ef\u6570\u636e\uff09\u548ctransformer\u589e\u5f3a\u76842D\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u752825,315\u4e2a\u5934\u90e8CT\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d3,774\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e34\u5e8a\u786e\u8ba4\u7684SDH\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5a6a\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff08AUC 0.75\uff09\u3002\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u884d\u751f\u56fe\u8c31\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff08AUCs 0.922\u548c0.926\uff09\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC 0.9407\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5SDH\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56fe\u8c31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684SDH\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u6574\u5408\u5230\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u5206\u8bca\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8SDH\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning.

Although recent studies have explored hyperbolic representations for better tackling the representation gap between different views, they focus primarily on instance-level alignment and neglect global semantic consistency, rendering them vulnerable to view-specific information (\\textit{e.g.}, noise and cross-view discrepancies). To this end, this paper proposes a novel Wasserstein-Aligned Hyperbolic (WAH) framework for multi-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits a view-specific hyperbolic encoder for each view to embed features into the Lorentz manifold for hierarchical semantic modeling.

In parallel, new embedded software building blocks are more and more written in Rust, while C/C++ dominance fades in this domain. On the other hand, small artificial neural networks (ANN) of various kinds are increasingly deployed in edge AI use cases, thus deployed and executed directly on low-power MCUs. In this context, both incremental improvements and novel innovative services will have to be continuously retrofitted using ANNs execution in software embedded on sensing/actuating systems already deployed in the field. However, there was so far no Rust embedded software platform automating parallelization for inference computation on multi-core MCUs executing arbitrary TinyML models. This paper thus fills this gap by introducing Ariel-ML, a novel toolkit we designed combining a generic TinyML pipeline and an embedded Rust software platform which can take full advantage of multi-core capabilities of various 32bit microcontroller families (Arm Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP-32). We published the full open source code of its implementation, which we used to benchmark its capabilities using a zoo of various TinyML models. We show that Ariel-ML outperforms prior art in terms of inference latency as expected, and we show that, compared to pre-existing toolkits using embedded C/C++, Ariel-ML achieves comparable memory footprints. Ariel-ML thus provides a useful basis for TinyML practitioners and resource-constrained embedded Rust developers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ariel-ML\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6838MCU\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684Rust\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fTinyML\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u4e0eC/C++\u76f8\u5f53", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f4e\u529f\u8017MCU\u4ece\u5355\u6838\u8f6c\u5411\u591a\u6838\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caRust\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u9886\u57df\u9010\u6e10\u53d6\u4ee3C/C++\uff0c\u540c\u65f6TinyML\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5728\u591a\u6838MCU\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u610fTinyML\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684Rust\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Ariel-ML\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528TinyML\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fRust\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd32\u4f4d\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08Arm Cortex-M\u3001RISC-V\u3001ESP-32\uff09\u7684\u591a\u6838\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "Ariel-ML\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fC/C++\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cdTinyML\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "Ariel-ML\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u6838MCU\u4e0aTinyML\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684Rust\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e73\u53f0\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3aTinyML\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fRust\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Our key idea is to generate cross-view consistent image pairs that are well-aligned with the source and target point clouds, enabling geometry-color feature fusion to facilitate robust matching. To ensure high-quality matching, the generated image pair should feature both 2D-3D geometric consistency and cross-view texture consistency. To achieve this, we introduce Match-ControlNet, a matching-specific, controllable 2D generative model. Specifically, it leverages the depth-conditioned generation capability of ControlNet to produce images that are geometrically aligned with depth maps derived from point clouds, ensuring 2D-3D geometric consistency. Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, Match-ControlNet further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation.

The current research introduces novel approaches for constructing fair k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and fair epsilon-neighborhood graphs that proactively enforce demographic parity during graph formation. By incorporating fairness constraints at the earliest stage of neighborhood selection steps, our approaches incorporate proportional representation of sensitive features into the local graph structure while maintaining geometric consistency.Our work addresses a critical gap in pre-processing for fair spectral clustering, demonstrating that topological fairness in graph construction is essential for achieving equitable clustering outcomes. Widely used graph construction methods like kNN and epsilon-neighborhood graphs propagate edge based disparate impact on sensitive groups, leading to biased clustering results. Providing representation of each sensitive group in the neighborhood of every node leads to fairer spectral clustering results because the topological features of the graph naturally reflect equitable group ratios. This research fills an essential shortcoming in fair unsupervised learning, by illustrating how topological fairness in graph construction inherently facilitates fairer spectral clustering results without the need for changes to the clustering algorithm itself. Thorough experiments on three synthetic datasets, seven real-world tabular datasets, and three real-world image datasets prove that our fair graph construction methods surpass the current baselines in graph clustering tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728kNN\u548c\u03b5\u90bb\u57df\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u9636\u6bb5\u5c31\u878d\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fe\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u786e\u4fdd\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982kNN\u548c\u03b5\u90bb\u57df\u56fe\uff09\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u516c\u5e73kNN\u56fe\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u03b5\u90bb\u57df\u56fe\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u90bb\u57df\u9009\u62e9\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b9e\u65bd\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5947\u5076\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c06\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u878d\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e03\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Motion- and Expression-Aware Reconstruction (MEAR) loss, which reweights the diffusion loss per pixel using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity, thereby enhancing cross-frame coherence in motion and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectSwap achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, identity fidelity, and motion and expression consistency across diverse in-the-wild video scenes.

These fires cause massive destruction to both property and human life. Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u5dde\u91ce\u706b\u5b8c\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u6240\u9700\u5929\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u975e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u5dde\u91ce\u706b\u5b63\u8282\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u56e2\u961f\u4e0d\u582a\u91cd\u8d1f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u534f\u52a9\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u706b\u707e\u98ce\u9669\u6216\u8513\u5ef6\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e5f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u800c\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u52a0\u5dde\u6797\u4e1a\u548c\u6d88\u9632\u90e8\u95e8FRAP\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u91ce\u706b\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u96c6\u6210\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u548cLSTM\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u5176\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u597d\u3002LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91ce\u706b\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u3002XGBoost\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cLSTM\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u624d\u80fd\u53d1\u6325\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, challenges have emerged, as these methods might generate unrealistic artifacts or hallucinations, which can interfere with analysis in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach for quantifying and comprehending hallucination artifacts to ensure trustworthy computer vision models. Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations.

Traditional regret-minimisation bandit strategies like Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) typically rely on distributional assumptions or asymptotic guarantees; further, they remain largely focused on regret, neglecting their statistical properties. We address this gap. Through the adoption of CP, we bridge the regret-minimising potential of a decision-making bandit policy with statistical guarantees in the form of finite-time prediction coverage.\n  We demonstrate the potential of it Conformal Bandits through simulation studies and an application to portfolio allocation, a typical small-gap regime, where differences in arm rewards are far too small for classical policies to achieve optimal regret bounds in finite sample. Motivated by this, we showcase our framework's practical advantage in terms of regret in small-gap settings, as well as its added value in achieving nominal coverage guarantees where classical UCB policies fail. Focusing on our application of interest, we further illustrate how integrating hidden Markov models to capture the regime-switching behaviour of financial markets, enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and translates into higher risk-adjusted regret efficiency returns, while preserving coverage guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06Conformal Prediction\u4e0e\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u5982\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u914d", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u5982Thompson Sampling\u548cUCB\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u9057\u61be\u8fb9\u754c", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConformal Bandits\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Conformal Prediction\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u914d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u540d\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u56de\u62a5", "conclusion": "Conformal Bandits\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u878d\u5165\u8001\u864e\u673a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u6548\u7387"}}

However, the growing scale of echocardiographic video data presents significant challenges in terms of storage, computation, and model training efficiency. Dataset distillation offers a promising solution by synthesizing a compact, informative subset of data that retains the key clinical features of the original dataset. In this work, we propose a novel approach for distilling a compact synthetic echocardiographic video dataset. Our method leverages motion feature extraction to capture temporal dynamics, followed by class-wise graph construction and representative sample selection using the Infomap algorithm.

However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the \"right to be forgotten\". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction.

Embedding motion in phase manifolds, latent spaces that capture local periodicity, has proven effective for motion prediction; however, existing approaches lack scalability and remain confined to specific settings. We introduce FunPhase, a functional periodic autoencoder that learns a phase manifold for motion and replaces discrete temporal decoding with a function-space formulation, enabling smooth trajectories that can be sampled at arbitrary temporal resolutions. FunPhase supports downstream tasks such as super-resolution and partial-body motion completion, generalizes across skeletons and datasets, and unifies motion prediction and generation within a single interpretable manifold. Our model achieves substantially lower reconstruction error than prior periodic autoencoder baselines while enabling a broader range of applications and performing on par with state-of-the-art motion generation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FunPhase\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5468\u671f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u4f4d\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u8eab\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f4d\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e14\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFunPhase\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5468\u671f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5f0f\u66ff\u4ee3\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5468\u671f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cFunPhase\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8eab\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u8865\u5168\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "FunPhase\u901a\u8fc7\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u4f4d\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u9aa8\u67b6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.\n  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models. Thus, our result gives what we believe is the first end-to-end learning guarantee for a generative model that plausibly captures modern language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7logit\u67e5\u8be2\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u4ece\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u4f55\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u5047\u8bbe\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, existing methods either rely on implicit part segmentation with limited granularity control or depend on strong external segmenters trained on large annotated datasets. In this work, we observe that part awareness emerges naturally during whole-object geometry learning and propose Geom-Seg VecSet, a unified geometry-segmentation latent representation that jointly encodes object geometry and part-level structure. Building on this representation, we introduce UniPart, a two-stage latent diffusion framework for image-guided part-level 3D generation. The first stage performs joint geometry generation and latent part segmentation, while the second stage conditions part-level diffusion on both whole-object and part-specific latents. A dual-space generation scheme further enhances geometric fidelity by predicting part latents in both global and canonical spaces.

In this paper, we propose STACHE, a comprehensive framework for generating local, black-box explanations for an agent's specific action within discrete Markov games. Our method produces a Composite Explanation consisting of two complementary components: (1) a Robustness Region, the connected neighborhood of states where the agent's action remains invariant, and (2) Minimal Counterfactuals, the smallest state perturbations required to alter that decision. By exploiting the structure of factored state spaces, we introduce an exact, search-based algorithm that circumvents the fidelity gaps of surrogate models. Empirical validation on Gymnasium environments demonstrates that our framework not only explains policy actions, but also effectively captures the evolution of policy logic during training - from erratic, unstable behavior to optimized, robust strategies - providing actionable insights into agent sensitivity and decision boundaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "STACHE\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u9ed1\u76d2\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u533a\u57df\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTACHE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff08\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u90bb\u57df\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff08\u6539\u53d8\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u72b6\u6001\u6270\u52a8\uff09\u7684\u590d\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gymnasium\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff08\u4ece\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u5230\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5065\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "STACHE\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8c03\u8bd5\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002"}}

However, the extent to which different model architectures capture antibody-specific biological properties remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate how architectural choices in PLMs influence their ability to comprehend antibody sequence characteristics and functions. We evaluate three state-of-the-art PLMs-AntiBERTa, BioBERT, and ESM2--against a general-purpose language model (GPT-2) baseline on antibody target specificity prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that while all PLMs achieve high classification accuracy, they exhibit distinct biases in capturing biological features such as V gene usage, somatic hypermutation patterns, and isotype information. Through attention attribution analysis, we show that antibody-specific models like AntiBERTa naturally learn to focus on complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), while general protein models benefit significantly from explicit CDR-focused training strategies.

Boltzmann Generators tackle this problem by pairing a generative model, capable of exact likelihood computation, with importance sampling to obtain consistent samples under the target distribution. Current Boltzmann Generators primarily use continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) trained with flow matching for efficient training of powerful models. However, likelihood calculation for these models is extremely costly, requiring thousands of function evaluations per sample, severely limiting their adoption. In this work, we propose Few-step Accurate Likelihoods for Continuous Flows (FALCON), a method which allows for few-step sampling with a likelihood accurate enough for importance sampling applications by introducing a hybrid training objective that encourages invertibility.

However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like \"hole\", \"cut\", \"scratch\" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of \"abnormal\" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset.

However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning.

The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models.

Multispectral images (MSIs) capture additional spectral cues across multiple bands, offering a promising alternative. However, the lack of training data has been the primary bottleneck to exploiting the potential of MSIs. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues.

To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface. A prototype-driven teacher-student objective aligns representations across multiple views, encouraging stable and lesion-aware features from labelled data. Experiments on three publicly available plant disease datasets show that StateSpace-SSL consistently outperforms the CNN- and transformer-based SSL baselines in various evaluation metrics.

However, due to the small size and the lack of intrinsic features of infrared small targets, the existing methods generally have the problem of inaccurate edge positioning and the target is easily submerged by the background. Therefore, we propose an innovative gradient-guided learning network (GGL-Net). Specifically, we are the first to explore the introduction of gradient magnitude images into the deep learning-based infrared small target detection method, which is conducive to emphasizing the edge details and alleviating the problem of inaccurate edge positioning of small targets. On this basis, we propose a novel dual-branch feature extraction network that utilizes the proposed gradient supplementary module (GSM) to encode raw gradient information into deeper network layers and embeds attention mechanisms reasonably to enhance feature extraction ability. In addition, we construct a two-way guidance fusion module (TGFM), which fully considers the characteristics of feature maps at different levels. It can facilitate the effective fusion of multi-scale feature maps and extract richer semantic information and detailed information through reasonable two-way guidance.

To assist in such planning, we address the challenge of predicting a patient-specific reconstruction target from a CT of the fractured tibia. Our ap- proach combines neural registration and autoencoder models. Specifically, we first train a modified spatial transformer network (STN) to register a raw CT to a standardized coordinate system of a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model healthy tibial varia- tions. Both the STN and AE models are further designed to be robust to masked input, allowing us to apply them to fractured CTs and decode to a prediction of the patient-specific healthy bone in standard coordinates. Our contributions include: i) a 3D-adapted STN for global spatial registration, ii) a comparative analysis of AEs for bone CT modeling, and iii) the extension of both to handle masked inputs for predictive generation of healthy bone structures.

By doing so, the integration of spatial- and frequency-domain learning enables DDSRNet to achieve highly competitive performance with low computational cost on three hyperspectral image datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for hyperspectral image super-resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u57df\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u7edcDDSRNet\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDDSRNet\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) Spatial-Net\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8eDWT\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u7ec6\u5316\u7c97\u7cd9\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3) \u5171\u4eab\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2aCNN\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3aLH\u3001HL\u3001HH\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5b50\u5e26\u3002\u901a\u8fc7DWT\u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u5e26\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u9006DWT\u91cd\u5efa\u6700\u7ec8\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDDSRNet\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u548c\u9891\u7387\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cDDSRNet\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline.

However, despite their strong visual perception modules, these models often fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions such as blur, noise, and compression, and may produce inconsistent evaluations across repeated inferences. This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types. Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLM-based IQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f4e\u9636\u5931\u771f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u677f\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5931\u771f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u4f4e\u9636\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u538b\u7f29\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1aMLLM-based IQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff1f", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4f4e\u9636\u5931\u771f\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u5931\u771f\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5fae\u8c03\u524d\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5931\u771f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aMLLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\uff0c\u5931\u771f\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece14.92%\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u81f384.43%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u4e13\u95e8\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7fMLLM-based\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

This study presents a robust and scalable modeling system for estimating soil properties in croplands, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), and pH, using remote sensing data and environmental covariates. The system employs a hybrid modeling approach, combining the indirect methods of modeling soil through proxies and drivers with direct spectral modeling. We extend current approaches by using interpretable physics-informed covariates derived from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and complex, nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level. This study contributes to the digital advancement of agriculture through the application of scalable, data-driven soil analysis frameworks that can be extended to related domains requiring quantitative soil evaluation, such as carbon markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u7b97\u519c\u7530\u571f\u58e4\u5c5e\u6027\uff08SOC\u3001N\u3001P\u3001K\u3001pH\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u519c\u7530\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cSOC\u548cN\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u519c\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u5c5e\u6027\u4f30\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u95f4\u63a5\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u5149\u8c31\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\u884d\u751f\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7269\u7406\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u6b27\u6d32\u519c\u7530\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5757\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u5272\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3002", "result": "SOC\u548cN\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff1aSOC\u7684MAE\u4e3a5.12 g/kg\uff0cCCC\u4e3a0.77\uff1bN\u7684MAE\u4e3a0.44 g/kg\uff0cCCC\u4e3a0.77\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u5f62\u6821\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523090%\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u571f\u58e4\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u505a\u51fa\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u91cf\u571f\u58e4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5982\u78b3\u5e02\u573a\u3002"}}

Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context.

We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption.

However, compared to meshes or radiance fields, existing multiview diffusion models offer limited appearance manipulation, particularly in terms of material, texture, or style.\n  In this paper, we present a lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models. Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models.

Our research concentrates on a fundamental sub-problem: the fine-grained classification of atomic interaction states, namely 'approaching', 'grabbing', and 'holding'. To this end, we introduce a structured data engineering process that converts raw videos from the MANIAC dataset into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Each vector encapsulates relational and dynamic properties from a short temporal window of motion. Our initial hypothesis posited that sequential modeling would be critical, leading us to compare static classifiers (MLPs) against temporal models (RNNs). Counter-intuitively, the key discovery occurred when we set the sequence length of a Bidirectional RNN to one (seq_length=1). This modification converted the network's function, compelling it to act as a high-capacity static feature encoder. This architectural change directly led to a significant accuracy improvement, culminating in a final score of 97.60%. Of particular note, our optimized model successfully overcame the most challenging transitional class, 'grabbing', by achieving a balanced F1-score of 0.90.

However, leveraging real-world imaging data in clinical research environments is still hampered by strict regulatory constraints, fragmented software infrastructure, and the challenges inherent in conducting large-cohort multicentre studies. This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

However, their capability in understanding infrared images remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce IF-Bench, the first high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating multimodal understanding of infrared images. IF-Bench consists of 499 images sourced from 23 infrared datasets and 680 carefully curated visual question-answer pairs, covering 10 essential dimensions of image understanding. Based on this benchmark, we systematically evaluate over 40 open-source and closed-source MLLMs, employing cyclic evaluation, bilingual assessment, and hybrid judgment strategies to enhance the reliability of the results. Our analysis reveals how model scale, architecture, and inference paradigms affect infrared image comprehension, providing valuable insights for this area. Furthermore, we propose a training-free generative visual prompting (GenViP) method, which leverages advanced image editing models to translate infrared images into semantically and spatially aligned RGB counterparts, thereby mitigating domain distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields significant performance improvements across a wide range of MLLMs. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/casiatao/IF-Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "IF-Bench\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b499\u5f20\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u548c680\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d610\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8640\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u519b\u4e8b\u3001\u533b\u7597\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efaIF-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u5305\u542b499\u5f20\u6765\u81ea23\u4e2a\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c680\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d610\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f3040\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90MLLMs\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u53cc\u8bed\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5224\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684RGB\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "1) \u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684MLLMs\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b3) \u4e3a\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "IF-Bench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs. Maritime vessel tracking is a widely researched application, often used to benchmark novel approaches to satellite tasking, forecasting, and analysis.

However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization. Our work demonstrates that specific parts of the model are responsible for copyrighted content generation. By applying model pruning, we can effectively suppress the probability of generating copyrighted content without targeting specific concepts while preserving the general generative capabilities of the model. Additionally, we show that our approach is both orthogonal and complementary to existing unlearning methods, thereby highlighting its potential to improve current unlearning and de-memorization techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniForget\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u6765\u6291\u5236\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u7248\u6743\u4fb5\u6743\u3001\u8096\u50cf\u6743\u4fb5\u6743\u548c\u5546\u6807\u4fb5\u6743\u7b49\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u80fd\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniForget\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\u8d1f\u8d23\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e14\u4e92\u8865\u7684\uff0c\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6539\u8fdb\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53bb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "UniForget\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Standard architectures utilizing stride-32 (P5) layers often fail to resolve narrow vessels, resulting in spatial feature dilution. In this work, we propose LiM-YOLO, a specialized detector designed to resolve these domain-specific conflicts. Based on a statistical analysis of ship scales, we introduce a Pyramid Level Shift Strategy that reconfigures the detection head to P2-P4. This shift ensures compliance with Nyquist sampling criteria for small objects while eliminating the computational redundancy of deep layers. To further enhance training stability on high-resolution inputs, we incorporate a Group Normalized Convolutional Block for Linear Projection (GN-CBLinear), which mitigates gradient volatility in micro-batch settings. Validated on SODA-A, DOTA-v1.5, FAIR1M-v2.0, and ShipRSImageNet-V1, LiM-YOLO demonstrates superior detection accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models.

Created using style transfer techniques from 12 subject classification datasets, SMA provides a diverse and extensive set of 4800 groups, combining various subjects (objects, plants, animals, human actions, textures) with multiple styles. SMA enables flexible control over groups and classes, allowing us to configure datasets to reflect diverse benchmark scenarios. While ideally, data collection would capture extensive group diversity, practical constraints often make this infeasible. SMA addresses this by enabling large and configurable group structures through flexible control over styles, subject classes, and domains-allowing datasets to reflect a wide range of real-world benchmark scenarios. This design not only expands group and class diversity, but also opens new methodological directions for evaluating model performance across diverse group and domain configurations-including scenarios with many minority groups, varying group imbalance, and complex domain shifts-and for studying fairness, robustness, and adaptation under a broader range of realistic conditions. To demonstrate SMA's effectiveness, we implemented two benchmarks: (1) a novel OOD generalization and group fairness benchmark leveraging SMA's domain, class, and group diversity to evaluate existing benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while simple balancing and algorithms utilizing group information remain competitive as claimed in previous benchmarks, increasing group diversity significantly impacts fairness, altering the superiority and relative rankings of algorithms. We also propose to use \\textit{Top-M worst group accuracy} as a new hyperparameter tuning metric, demonstrating broader fairness during optimization and delivering better final worst-group accuracy for larger group diversity.

Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of \"apparent rotation\", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset. Furthermore, we validate our model's suitability for real-world space missions by quantizing it and deploying it on power-constrained edge hardware.

However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\\%, 5\\%, and 10\\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores.

A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity.

We adapt two off-the-shelf models as baselines for online struggle detection and anticipation. Online struggle detection achieves 70-80% per-frame mAP, while struggle anticipation up to 2 seconds ahead yields comparable performance with slight drops.

The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model.

We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities. Our findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting parsers for downstream applications and establish a robust, scalable methodology that enables reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality.

We introduce a new task, Visual Action Reasoning, and propose VisualActBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1,074 videos and 3,733 human-annotated actions across four real-world scenarios. Each action is labeled with an Action Prioritization Level (APL) and a proactive-reactive type to assess models' human-aligned reasoning and value sensitivity. We evaluate 29 VLMs on VisualActBench and find that while frontier models like GPT4o demonstrate relatively strong performance, a significant gap remains compared to human-level reasoning, particularly in generating proactive, high-priority actions.

This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction. We further demonstrate that integrating our method with existing feed-forward frameworks, consistently improves detail preservation, opening new possibilities for high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Splatent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf93D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u57282D\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u8868\u793a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f43D\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5fae\u8c03VAE\u727a\u7272\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "Splatent\u5728VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u57282D\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u57283D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSplatent\u5728VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VAE\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe3D\u91cd\u5efa\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u3002"}}

We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture. The model's internal VLM provides intrinsic feedback by assessing whether the edited video logically satisfies the given instruction. The differential feedback that refines the generator's reasoning behavior during training.

However, these methods degrade sharply under sparse-view settings, where limited observations lead to severe ambiguity between geometry, reflectance, and lighting. We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.
