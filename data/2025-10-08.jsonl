We present two experiments investigating MLLM\nperformance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines\n288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving\narithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved\nnear-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human\neducators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical\nillustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the\nanswer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require\nsophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to\nanalyze and evaluate them.

MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first\ntrains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these\nmargins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each\nindividual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective\ntarget margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,\nallowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved\noptimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We\nvalidate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where\nMADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across\ndatasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\\% on\nHigh Quality data and +10.5\\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.\nOur results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to\npreference alignment."}

A key innovation of the method lies in\nits temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current\nstatus but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach\nenables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when\noverlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method\ndemonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in\nchallenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results\nconfirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and\nearly seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining\nlow-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain\nphenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal\nintegration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise\ndetermination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly\neffective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation\ntechniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate\ncounting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root\nmean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability."}

In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which\ninevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to\ndirectly model \"object\" as the visual equivalence of \"word,\" pushing the model\nto learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate\nour hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach\ncan be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random\npatches.

OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization\nencoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object\nacross multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each\nproduct as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is\nadopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively\nincorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.\nIn offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while\nimproving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning.

In this\npaper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the\nstructural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.\nIn this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph\ngenerators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these\nlearning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in\ntraining or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.\nTherefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph\nsnapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose\nan attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural\ncharacteristics on sampled ego-graphs.

This design\nenables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on\nfixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an\ninterpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further\nenhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO\nachieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also\nprovide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a\nbounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds\nin any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond\none-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type\nintegration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for\ncontinuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to\nspectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such\nas the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO)."}

Built on a discrete diffusion framework,\nMeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared\nprobabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we\nemploy a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,\nleveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are\nintroduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,\nand (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.\nExperiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on\nMIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR\n0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance\ndownstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,\nplus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports\ncoherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs."}

We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the\nCIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance\nagainst strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as\nPCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves\nsuperior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream\ntraining time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =\n0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative\narchitecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,\nestablishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world\napplications."}

The performance gap stems from the fact that\nautoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered\npoint sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local\npredictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but\nundermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering\nits ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,\nconsistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the\nlevel-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a\ncoarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at\nlow resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher\nscales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization\naligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of\npoint sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed\norderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the\nautoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based\nbaselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense\ngeneration with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more\npronounced, underscoring its scalability potential."}

This paper presents a\nnovel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond\nstandard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics\nthat capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions\ninclude introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the\noriginal and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared\ntests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across\nboth the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts\nthat aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by\napplying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained\non three diverse and socially meaningful datasets.

However, their\npotential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains\nunderexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing\nPRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle\nwith table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema\ninteraction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this\nlimitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)\nreasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based\nverification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design\na scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality\nstep-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with\ntool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a\ndual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use\nreasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded\nreward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly\ndesigned PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering\nnumerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves\ndownstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines\nsuch as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong\ngeneralizability across diverse TTS strategies."}
