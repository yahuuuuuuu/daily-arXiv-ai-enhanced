*Ankan Aich,Yangming Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Depth Anything V2架构的单目深度估计方法，通过DV-LORA适配技术将合成先验迁移到医疗领域，在手术内镜场景中显著提升深度估计精度，特别是在高反射和透明表面区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术内镜环境中的单目深度估计面临挑战，特别是在反射表面和充满液体的环境中。现有基于自监督学习的方法通常依赖噪声伪标签训练的基础模型，容易在薄手术工具和透明表面出现边界崩溃问题。

Method: 1. 利用Depth Anything V2架构的高保真合成先验，该架构能捕捉薄结构的精确几何细节
2. 采用动态向量低秩适配（DV-LORA）技术，以最小参数预算将合成先验适配到医疗领域
3. 在SCARED数据集上引入物理分层评估协议，专门量化高反射区域的性能

Result: 在SCARED数据集上达到新的最先进水平：准确度（<1.25）达到98.1%，平方相对误差比现有基线降低超过17%，在不利手术光照条件下表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过结合Depth Anything V2的合成先验和DV-LORA适配技术，成功解决了手术内镜环境中单目深度估计的挑战，特别是在高反射和透明表面区域，为机器人手术提供了更可靠的深度感知能力。

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

### [2] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，允许在Noise2Noise训练中对噪声目标应用特定非线性函数而不引入显著偏差，解决了HDR图像去噪中因异常值导致的训练问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise2Noise方法虽然无需干净目标图像，但非线性函数应用于噪声目标会引入偏差，限制了预处理选项。特别是在HDR图像去噪中，异常值会严重影响训练效果，而常用的色调映射非线性函数被认为与Noise2Noise不兼容。

Method: 开发理论框架分析非线性函数的影响，识别一类偏差最小的非线性函数。针对HDR图像去噪，研究特定损失函数和色调映射函数的组合，可以在减少异常值影响的同时引入最小偏差。

Result: 将方法应用于现有的基于机器学习的蒙特卡洛去噪器，仅使用噪声训练数据就能获得接近原始实现（使用高样本数参考图像训练）的结果。

Conclusion: 某些非线性函数可以在Noise2Noise训练中应用而不引入显著偏差，这扩展了Noise2Noise的应用范围，特别是在HDR图像处理中，使得仅使用噪声数据就能获得接近使用干净数据训练的效果。

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

TL;DR: 提出基于视频分析的自动评估系统，用于城市作战训练中的"进入并清理房间"演练，无需额外硬件即可评估认知、心理运动和团队协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市作战训练需要情境意识和肌肉记忆，但传统评估方法依赖昂贵传感器或主观观察，难以实现客观、可扩展的性能评估。

Method: 使用计算机视觉模型从训练视频中提取2D骨架、视线向量和运动轨迹，开发任务特定指标，通过扩展的认知任务分析层次结构加权组合生成团队协作和认知的总体评分。

Result: 通过真实世界ECR演练的案例研究，展示了系统能提供可操作的领域特定指标，捕获个人和团队表现，支持行动后评估和智能辅导系统。

Conclusion: 视频分析可实现可扩展的自动评估，但存在跟踪困难、地面真实验证等限制，未来工作包括扩展到3D视频数据和在合成训练环境中实现可扩展评估。

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFP是一种神经网络结构，用于将长视频压缩为短上下文，通过显式预训练目标保留任意时间位置单帧的高频细节，可将20秒视频压缩到约5k长度，并可作为记忆编码器用于自回归视频模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频处理中上下文长度限制的问题，传统方法在处理长视频时面临上下文窗口有限、计算成本高的问题，需要一种能够压缩长视频内容同时保留关键视觉细节的方法。

Method: 提出PFP神经网络结构，采用显式预训练目标来保留单帧的高频细节，支持在任意时间位置检索具有感知保留外观的随机帧，可将20秒视频压缩到约5k长度的上下文。

Result: 预训练模型可直接微调作为自回归视频模型的记忆编码器，实现低成本上下文的长历史记忆，相对较低的保真度损失，通过消融实验评估框架并讨论不同神经网络架构设计的权衡。

Conclusion: PFP提供了一种有效的长视频压缩方法，能够在保持视觉细节的同时显著减少上下文长度，为长视频处理任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present PFP, a neural network structure to compress long videos into short contexts, with an explicit pretraining objective to preserve the high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions. The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.

### [5] [Lifelong Domain Adaptive 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23860)
*Qucheng Peng,Hongfei Xue,Pu Wang,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出终身域自适应3D人体姿态估计新任务，通过GAN框架整合3D姿态生成器、2D姿态判别器和3D姿态估计器，解决非平稳目标域适应和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法依赖受控环境标注数据，难以泛化到真实场景。传统域自适应方法忽略了目标域数据的非平稳特性，无法处理连续变化的域适应问题。

Method: 提出终身域自适应3D HPE框架，包含3D姿态生成器、2D姿态判别器和3D姿态估计器。生成器整合姿态感知、时序感知和域感知知识，增强当前域适应并减轻对先前域的灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在多种域自适应3D HPE数据集上进行广泛实验，证明该方法在适应新域和保留先前知识方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 首次将终身域自适应引入3D人体姿态估计，提出的GAN框架能有效处理非平稳目标域，缓解域偏移和灾难性遗忘问题，为实际应用提供解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出深度学习框架将儿科T1加权MRI转换为合成CT，实现颅骨分割和颅缝分割，填补MRI无法显示骨骼和颅缝的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT可用于评估儿科颅骨发育和颅缝骨化，但具有电离辐射风险；MRI无辐射但无法显示颅骨和颅缝。需要一种非侵入性方法来量化儿科颅骨发育。

Method: 使用深度学习驱动的流程，将0.2-2岁儿童的T1加权MRI转换为合成CT，预测颅骨分割，生成颅缝概率热图，并从热图直接分割颅缝。采用领域特定的变分自编码器。

Result: 合成CT与真实CT的结构相似度达99%，Fréchet起始距离为1.01。颅骨分割在七块颅骨上的平均Dice系数为85%，颅缝分割Dice系数达80%。通过TOST检验证实合成CT与真实CT在分割结果上等效。

Conclusion: 这是首个能从MRI生成合成CT并实现颅缝分割的儿科颅骨CT合成框架，填补了非侵入性颅骨评估的关键空白，为诊断和治疗颅骨发育障碍提供了新方法。

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

TL;DR: 该论文探索了在高分辨率光电遥感数据上训练基础模型的扩展规律，发现即使在万亿像素规模下，性能仍受数据限制而非模型参数限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态机器学习应用（如图像描述、搜索和推理）依赖于对非文本模态的鲁棒、领域专业化编码器。在自然图像领域，互联网规模数据充足，扩展规律已得到较好理解，但在高价值领域如遥感中，这些关系了解甚少。

Method: 使用超过一千万亿像素的商业卫星光电数据和MITRE联邦AI沙箱，训练逐步增大的视觉变换器（ViT）骨干网络，报告在千万亿规模下观察到的成功和失败模式，并分析跨其他遥感模态弥合领域差距的影响。

Result: 研究发现，即使在这种规模下，性能仍与数据限制机制一致，而非模型参数限制机制。观察到性能随数据规模扩展，但尚未达到饱和点。

Conclusion: 这些实践见解旨在为数据收集策略、计算预算和优化计划提供信息，以推进前沿规模遥感基础模型的未来发展。研究强调了在遥感领域继续扩展数据规模的重要性。

Abstract: We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier-scale RS foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声技能评估依赖专家监督，具有主观性和耗时性；现有自动化评估方法多采用监督学习，局限于预定义的影响因素

Method: 提出双层优化框架，包含临床任务预测器和技能预测器，通过同时优化两个网络来联合训练，以任务执行质量作为技能指标

Result: 在真实临床胎儿头部超声视频上验证，证明该框架能够预测超声技能，将优化的任务性能量化为技能指标

Conclusion: 该方法实现了无需人工评级的超声技能自动评估，通过任务执行质量客观量化技能水平

Abstract: Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.

Conclusion: MGML框架能有效处理不完整多模态MRI数据，不改变原模型架构，可方便集成到训练流程中实现端到端优化

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

Conclusion: 提出的CVGL系统通过三个关键改进有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的特征聚合和对齐挑战，在参数效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) aims to estimate the geographic location of a query image by matching it with images from a large-scale database. However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

TL;DR: DehazeSNN是一种创新的图像去雾架构，结合U-Net设计和脉冲神经网络，通过OLIFBlock增强跨通道通信，在保持高性能的同时减少计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像去雾是计算机视觉中的重要挑战。传统方法依赖大气散射模型，而深度学习方法（CNN和Transformer）虽有所改进，但CNN难以处理长距离依赖，Transformer计算资源需求大。需要一种既能有效处理局部和长距离依赖，又计算高效的方法。

Method: 提出DehazeSNN架构，集成U-Net-like设计和脉冲神经网络（SNNs）。引入正交泄漏积分发放块（OLIFBlock）来增强跨通道通信，有效捕获多尺度图像特征，同时管理局部和长距离依赖。

Conclusion: DehazeSNN通过结合SNN和U-Net设计，解决了传统CNN和Transformer在图像去雾中的局限性，实现了高性能和计算效率的平衡，为图像去雾任务提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an innovative architecture that integrates a U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with a smaller model size and less multiply-accumulate operations. The proposed dehazing method is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/DehazeSNN.

TL;DR: T2VAttack：针对文本到视频扩散模型的对抗攻击研究，从语义和时间两个维度评估模型鲁棒性，发现即使微小提示修改也能显著降低生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到视频（T2V）扩散模型在生成高质量、时间连贯的视频方面取得了显著进展，但其对抗攻击的脆弱性尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白，从语义和时间两个维度全面评估T2V模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 提出T2VAttack框架，包含两个攻击目标（语义目标评估视频-文本对齐，时间目标评估时间动态）和两种攻击方法：T2VAttack-S通过贪婪搜索识别关键词并用同义词替换；T2VAttack-I迭代插入优化词以最小化提示扰动。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2V模型（ModelScope、CogVideoX、Open-Sora、HunyuanVideo）上进行评估，实验表明即使单个词的替换或插入也能导致语义保真度和时间动态的显著退化，揭示了当前T2V扩散模型的关键脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前T2V扩散模型对对抗攻击高度脆弱，即使是微小的提示修改也能严重破坏生成质量。这凸显了在开发更鲁棒的T2V模型时需要关注对抗安全性，并为未来防御机制的研究提供了基础。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

Conclusion: 该方法利用深度学习从卫星时序数据中学习地表正常状态，能够以更高灵敏度检测异常变化，为实现基于免费多光谱卫星数据的全球尺度自动化地表变化监测提供了路径。

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

Conclusion: GCA-ResUNet在分割精度和计算效率之间提供了有利的权衡，为临床部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

Motivation: 自监督语义分割方法在面对外观歧义（如阴影、眩光、局部纹理）时容易失败，因为过度依赖不稳定的外观特征。需要引入稳定的几何拓扑信息来弥补这一缺陷。

Conclusion: 通过引入稳定的拓扑信息来桥接几何和外观特征，能够有效解决自监督语义分割中的外观歧义问题，提升分割性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用太阳位置先验知识改进3D高斯溅射模型的新方法，用于从空间交会对接图像序列中恢复未知航天器的3D结构，提高渲染图像的光度精度以支持后续姿态估计任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在空间交会对接过程中，从图像序列恢复目标航天器的3D结构对导航和操作至关重要。传统3D高斯溅射方法假设静态光照条件，但空间环境中的动态光照（特别是太阳位置变化）会严重影响渲染质量，进而影响基于光度优化的相机姿态估计精度。

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that Visual Language Models (VLMs) hold great potential for tasks such as automated medical diagnosis. However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the HilbertMed-SAM module for precise lesion segmentation, with the generated multimodal enhanced prompts then guiding the VLM toward accurate disease classification. Our key innovation lies in the systematic redesign of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture: we incorporate Hilbert space-filling curves into the scanning mechanism of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) to maximize the preservation of spatial locality in 3D data, a property critical for medical image analysis. We also introduce a novel Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism and a scale-aware decoder to capture fine-grained details. Meanwhile, the prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks and their corresponding textual attributes into an information-dense prompt to support VLM inference. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Hilbert-VLM model. On the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark, it achieves a Dice score of 82.35 percent, with a diagnostic classification accuracy (ACC) of 78.85 percent. These results demonstrate that the proposed model offers substantial potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical VLM-based analysis.

Motivation: 现有流式扩散编辑方法在源图像和目标图像分布之间直接转换时，潜在轨迹存在累积速度误差，导致语义不一致和结构保真度损失。

Method: 提出条件速度校正(CVC)框架：1) 双视角速度转换机制，将潜在演化分解为结构保持分支和语义引导分支；2) 基于经验贝叶斯推断和Tweedie校正的后验一致性更新，对条件速度场进行数学基础误差补偿。

Conclusion: CVC通过重新思考速度在分布间转换中的作用，提供了一种原则性框架来解决流式编辑中的速度误差问题，实现了语义一致性和结构保真度的平衡。

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

Conclusion: 提出的结构引导分配方法显著提升了2D高斯泼溅的表示能力和率失真性能，同时保持了原生解码速度。

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Motivation: 现有文本引导分割方法通常作为一次性定位处理，当初始定位错误时缺乏验证、重新聚焦和细化的能力。需要一种能够进行多轮推理和动作交互的智能系统。

Conclusion: RSAgent通过智能体式的多轮工具调用方法，有效解决了传统一次性分割方法的局限性，实现了更准确、可验证和可细化的文本引导对象分割。

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-form video editing poses unique challenges due to the exponential increase in the computational cost from joint editing and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion across extended sequences. To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态检索在多模态分析中取得进展，但大规模标注数据收集耗时费力，多模态数据标注不可避免地包含噪声，这会降低模型检索性能。现有鲁棒CMR方法（鲁棒学习范式、标签校准策略、实例选择机制）往往无法同时满足模型性能上限、校准可靠性和数据利用率

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Abstract: Pathology context and expert experience play significant roles in clinical ocular disease diagnosis. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods. Further visualization analysis explains the inherent behavior of PRM and EPGA that affects the decision-making process of DNNs.

Motivation: 细粒度遥感数据集通常采用层次标签结构，但现有方法在将语义层次嵌入表示学习空间时面临两个关键问题：1) 标签层次中数据分布不平衡导致高频类别主导学习过程；2) 类别间语义关系学习干扰类别无关的定位任务。

Method: 提出平衡层次对比损失与解耦学习策略，结合DETR框架。平衡对比损失引入可学习的类别原型，在每一层次平衡不同类别的梯度贡献；解耦策略将DETR的对象查询分为分类和定位两组，实现任务特定的特征提取和优化。

Result: 在三个具有层次标注的细粒度数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过平衡层次对比损失解决数据不平衡问题，通过解耦学习策略避免分类-定位干扰，有效提升了细粒度遥感目标检测性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Conclusion: 通过解耦时间定位与文本响应的因子化学习方法，能够有效提升视频语言模型的事件级感知能力，证据标记和因子化偏好优化是关键创新

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

TL;DR: 提出Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR)框架，通过两阶段"思考-行动"决策过程解决文本到动作生成中的语义-运动阻抗不匹配问题

Motivation: 当前文本到动作生成方法直接将符号语言映射到连续姿态，面临语义-运动阻抗不匹配的根本理论瓶颈：难以在单次映射中将语义密集的离散语言意图落地到运动密集的高频运动数据

Method: 提出Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR)框架，采用双粒度分词器将运动解耦为两个流形：用于规划全局拓扑的压缩语义推理潜空间，和用于保持物理保真度的高频执行潜空间。通过先推理（规划粗略轨迹）再行动（实例化帧）的两阶段过程

Result: 在T2M-GPT（离散）和MotionStreamer（连续）两个代表性基线上实现LMR，实验显示在语义对齐和物理合理性方面均获得非平凡改进

Conclusion: 最优的运动规划基底不是自然语言，而是学习到的运动对齐概念空间。通过潜空间系统2推理有效桥接语言与物理之间的不可言说鸿沟

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

Conclusion: GeoBench建立了全面的几何问题解决基准测试，同时为开发几何问题解决系统提供了可操作的指导方针，揭示了当前模型在复杂几何推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

Abstract: Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

Conclusion: D²-Align通过方向性校正奖励信号，有效缓解了偏好模式崩溃问题，在文本到图像扩散模型对齐中实现了质量与多样性的更好平衡

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

Abstract: Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization. BSD consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g. +1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing architecture-preserving self-distillation methods for a range of deep architectures and datasets. Additional benefits include improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. When combined with a contrastive loss, BSD achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise for single-stage, single-network methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffThinker：一种基于扩散的生成式多模态推理框架，将多模态推理重新定义为原生的图像到图像生成任务，在视觉中心任务中显著优于现有MLLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理过程仍然以文本为中心，导致在复杂的长视野、视觉中心任务中表现不佳，需要一种更有效的视觉推理范式。

Method: 提出DiffThinker框架，采用基于扩散的生成式多模态推理范式，将多模态推理重新定义为原生的图像到图像生成任务，强调逻辑一致性和空间精度。

Result: 在四个领域（顺序规划、组合优化、约束满足和空间配置）的广泛实验中，DiffThinker显著优于领先的闭源模型（GPT-5 +314.2%，Gemini-3-Flash +111.6%）和微调的Qwen3-VL-32B基线（+39.0%）。

Conclusion: 生成式多模态推理是视觉中心推理的有前景方法，DiffThinker展示了该范式在效率、可控性、原生并行性和协作性方面的核心优势。

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Pin-Wei Chen,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep Global Clustering (DGC) 是一个用于高光谱图像分割的内存高效框架，通过局部补丁学习全局聚类结构，无需预训练，在消费级硬件上30分钟内完成训练，但存在优化不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分析面临计算瓶颈，数据量超过可用内存。现有基础模型在遥感数据集上预训练，但难以迁移到近距离农业监测等特定领域应用，因为光谱特征、空间尺度和语义目标存在根本差异。

Method: 提出Deep Global Clustering (DGC)框架，通过重叠区域的小补丁操作来强制一致性，从局部补丁观察中学习全局聚类结构，保持恒定内存使用，无需预训练。

Result: 在叶片病害数据集上，DGC实现了背景-组织分离（平均IoU 0.925），并通过可导航的语义粒度展示了无监督病害检测能力。但框架存在优化不稳定问题，源于多目标损失平衡。

Conclusion: DGC的设计理念有价值，可作为智力支架，但稳定实现需要动态损失平衡的原则性方法。该框架展示了内存高效的高光谱图像分割潜力，但需要进一步改进优化稳定性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型难以覆盖低概率区域，标准CFG会导致样本过度简化或失真，而基于坏版本引导的方法需要精心设计的退化策略、额外训练和采样步骤。

Method: 提出Internal Guidance(IG)：1) 训练时在中间层添加辅助监督；2) 采样时外推中间层和深层输出来获得生成结果。这是一个简单有效的策略。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，SiT-XL/2+IG在80和800轮分别达到FID=5.31和1.75。LightningDiT-XL/1+IG达到FID=1.34，结合CFG后达到当前SOTA的FID=1.19。

Conclusion: IG方法简单有效，显著提升了训练效率和生成质量，在各种baseline上都取得了显著改进，为扩散模型提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

TL;DR: 提出PointRAFT网络，直接从部分点云预测马铃薯块茎重量，无需完整3D重建，满足收获机高吞吐量需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 马铃薯收获机上RGB-D相机重建的点云因自遮挡而不完整，导致块茎重量系统性低估，需要高精度、高吞吐量的重量预测方法

Method: PointRAFT点云回归网络，引入块茎高度嵌入作为几何线索，直接从部分点云预测连续3D形状属性（如重量），避免完整3D重建

Result: 在5,254个测试点云上，平均绝对误差12.0g，均方根误差17.2g，推理时间6.3ms/点云，吞吐量达150块茎/秒，优于线性回归和PointNet++基准

Conclusion: PointRAFT为马铃薯重量估计提供高效解决方案，满足商业收获机需求，且作为通用3D回归网络适用于多种表型分析和机器人感知任务

Abstract: Potato yield is a key indicator for optimizing cultivation practices in agriculture. Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks. The code, network weights, and a subset of the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/pieterblok/pointraft.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散transformer(DiT)在视觉生成中表现出色，但其迭代去噪过程结合大容量导致高推理成本。现有研究表明DiT模型在迭代去噪过程中存在大量跨步骤的冗余计算

Method: 提出CorGi框架，选择性重用DiT中transformer块的输出：缓存低贡献块并在每个区间内后续步骤中重用；针对文生图任务提出CorGi+，利用每块交叉注意力图识别显著token并应用部分注意力更新

Result: 在最先进的DiT模型上评估，CorGi和CorGi+平均实现高达2.0倍加速，同时保持高质量生成

Conclusion: CorGi和CorGi+是有效的训练免费DiT推理加速框架，通过减少冗余计算显著提升推理效率而不损害生成质量

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

Method: 提出渐进式生成对抗网络生成合成数据补充真实数据；采用加权方法将合成数据与真实数据结合；使用多目标元启发式群体优化算法优化分类器超参数。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能有效处理疫情期间医学图像分类中的数据不平衡问题，为COVID-19等疾病的快速准确检测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARM是一个轻量级可学习模块，通过自适应融合CLIP的层次特征来提升开放词汇语义分割性能，采用"训练一次，随处使用"的范式，在多个基准上显著提升基线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练免费方法要么依赖昂贵的外部基础模型（如SAM、DINO），要么使用静态启发式方法处理CLIP内部特征，这些方法要么计算成本高，要么效果不理想。CLIP的图像级表示缺乏像素级细节，限制了开放词汇语义分割的性能。

Method: 提出注意力精炼模块（ARM），包含语义引导的交叉注意力块（使用深层特征K、V选择和精炼细节丰富的浅层特征Q）和自注意力块。采用"训练一次，随处使用"的范式，在通用数据集（如COCO-Stuff）上训练一次后，可作为通用即插即用后处理器用于各种训练免费框架。

Result: 大量实验表明，ARM在多个基准测试中持续提升基线性能，且推理开销可忽略不计，为训练免费的开放词汇语义分割建立了高效有效的范式。

Conclusion: ARM通过自适应融合CLIP的层次特征，有效解锁和精炼了CLIP的内部潜力，为训练免费的开放词汇语义分割提供了一种轻量级、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象编辑方法在保持高视觉保真度和时间连贯性方面存在困难，而视觉中心自动驾驶系统需要多样化和可扩展的训练数据来实现鲁棒性能。

Method: 基于文本到视频扩散先验，注入预训练2D编码器的时序无关潜在特征到3D解码器以恢复细节；采用两阶段数据对齐策略（粗粒度3D对齐和细粒度2D精炼）解决场景对象与插入资产的分布不匹配问题。

Result: 在多种编辑场景中实现了高真实感和时间一致性，并能泛化到其他视频到视频转换任务，为未来研究提供了可靠基准。

Conclusion: Mirage通过创新的特征注入和对齐策略，成功解决了驾驶场景资产编辑中的时空一致性和分布匹配问题，为视频数据增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research. Our code is available at https://github.com/wm-research/mirage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的面部表情识别模型在多样化数据上泛化能力较弱，导致在真实世界应用中性能下降，阻碍了FER作为研究领域的发展。虽然研究者提出了复杂架构来解决泛化问题，但这些方法需要跨域训练，这与真实世界应用需求相矛盾。

Conclusion: MotivNet验证了作为Sapiens下游任务的可行性，使面部表情识别在真实世界应用中更具激励性，推动了FER领域的发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

Conclusion: MambaSeg通过并行Mamba编码器和双维度交互模块，有效融合RGB和事件数据，在保持高效计算的同时实现了优越的语义分割性能，为多模态感知系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

Motivation: 牙科CBCT中的金属伪影严重遮挡解剖结构，影响诊断。现有深度学习方法存在局限：监督方法因"回归到均值"导致频谱模糊，无监督方法存在结构幻觉风险，而扩散模型虽然真实但采样慢，不适合临床使用

Conclusion: PGMP框架有效解决了牙科CBCT金属伪影减少问题，通过物理模拟、确定性单次推理和医学先验约束，实现了高效且临床可靠的伪影去除

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出空间提升全景拼接框架，将2D图像提升为3D点云表示，通过统一投影中心生成几何一致的360°全景图，显著减少视差和遮挡场景中的几何失真和重影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像拼接技术主要使用2D单应性变换和网格变形，适用于近似共面或视差较小的场景，但在真实3D场景（多深度层和遮挡）中会导致重影、结构弯曲和拉伸失真，特别是在多视图累积和360°闭环拼接场景中问题更加严重。

Method: 1. 将输入图像提升为统一坐标系中的密集3D点表示，通过置信度指标增强全局跨视图融合；2. 在3D空间中建立统一投影中心，使用等距圆柱投影将融合数据映射到单一全景流形；3. 在画布域进行空洞填充以处理视点转换揭示的未知区域，恢复连续纹理和语义一致性。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在显著视差和复杂遮挡场景中大幅减少了几何失真和重影伪影，产生了更自然、更一致的全景结果。

Conclusion: 该框架将拼接从2D变形范式重新概念化为3D一致性范式，能够灵活集成各种3D提升和补全模块，为复杂3D场景的全景拼接提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

TL;DR: EndoRare：基于单张参考图像生成罕见胃肠道病变图像的one-shot框架，通过语言引导的概念解耦分离病理特征与非诊断属性，用于AI模型增强和临床培训


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见胃肠道病变在常规内镜检查中不常见，导致可用于开发可靠AI模型和培训新手临床医生的数据有限，需要数据高效的方法来弥合罕见疾病的数据缺口

Method: 提出EndoRare框架：1）使用语言引导的概念解耦将病理特征与非诊断属性分离；2）将病理特征编码为可学习的原型嵌入；3）变化非诊断属性以确保多样性；4）从单张参考图像合成多样化的高保真病变样本

Result: 1）专家认为合成图像具有临床可信度；2）用于数据增强时显著提升下游AI分类器性能，提高低假阳性率下的真阳性率；3）盲法阅读研究显示，接触EndoRare生成案例的新手内镜医生召回率提高0.400，精确率提高0.267

Conclusion: EndoRare建立了一个实用、数据高效的途径，弥合了计算机辅助诊断和临床教育中的罕见疾病数据缺口，为AI模型开发和临床培训提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

TL;DR: Virtual-Eyes预处理管道提升通用基础模型在低剂量CT肺癌筛查中的性能，但对专用模型可能产生负面影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在低剂量CT肺癌筛查中缺乏对预处理效果的量化评估，需要开发临床导向的质量控制管道来评估其对不同模型的影响

Method: 开发Virtual-Eyes 16位CT质量控制管道，包括512x512平面分辨率标准化、非诊断性序列排除、连续肺块提取等步骤，使用765名NLST患者数据评估RAD-DINO、Merlin、Sybil和ResNet-18模型

Result: Virtual-Eyes显著提升RAD-DINO性能（切片级AUC从0.576到0.610，患者级AUC从0.646到0.683），但Sybil和ResNet-18性能下降，Merlin表现有限

Conclusion: 解剖学导向的质量控制可以稳定和改进通用基础模型工作流程，但可能破坏已适应原始临床环境的专用模型，强调了预处理对模型性能的重要影响

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

TL;DR: UniAct是一个两阶段框架，通过微调MLLM和因果流式处理管道，实现人形机器人以低于500毫秒的延迟执行多模态指令，在零样本跟踪不完美参考运动方面成功率提升19%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人领域长期目标是实现能够遵循多样化多模态指令的通用智能体，但现有方法难以将语言、音乐、轨迹等异构指令转化为稳定、实时的动作，高层多模态感知与全身执行之间存在显著瓶颈。

Method: 提出UniAct两阶段框架：1) 通过FSQ共享离散码本统一多模态输入，确保跨模态对齐同时将运动约束在物理可行流形上；2) 集成微调的多模态大语言模型(MLLM)与因果流式处理管道，实现实时动作生成。

Result: 在20小时的人形运动基准UniMoCap上验证，实现了低于500毫秒的延迟，零样本跟踪不完美参考运动的成功率提升19%，在多样化真实场景中展现出鲁棒的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniAct标志着向响应式通用人形助手迈出关键一步，通过统一的感知和控制实现无缝交互，为人形机器人领域提供了有效的多模态指令执行解决方案。

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

TL;DR: CERES是一个因果推理框架，通过双模态因果干预解决Ego-RVOS任务中的语言偏见和视觉混淆问题，在基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ego-RVOS任务在分割第一人称视频中与人类动作相关的特定对象时面临挑战，现有方法容易受到数据集偏见和第一人称视角视觉混淆（如快速运动、频繁遮挡）的影响，学习到虚假相关性。

Method: CERES是一个插件式因果框架，采用双模态因果干预：1) 使用后门调整原则对抗语言表示偏见；2) 利用前门调整概念，通过因果原则指导将语义视觉特征与几何深度信息智能集成，解决视觉混淆问题。

Result: 在Ego-RVOS基准测试中，CERES实现了最先进的性能，证明了因果推理在构建更可靠的自我中心视频理解模型方面的潜力。

Conclusion: CERES通过因果推理有效解决了Ego-RVOS任务中的语言偏见和视觉混淆问题，为更广泛的自我中心视频理解提供了可靠模型构建的新方向。

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

TL;DR: SenseNova-MARS是一个多模态代理推理与搜索框架，通过强化学习让视觉语言模型具备交错的视觉推理和工具使用能力，在搜索导向的视觉理解任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在代理推理方面主要局限于文本导向的思维链或孤立工具调用，缺乏人类般的熟练度来无缝交错动态工具操作与连续推理，特别是在需要协调外部工具（如搜索和图像裁剪）的知识密集型和视觉复杂场景中。

Method: 提出SenseNova-MARS多模态代理推理与搜索框架，通过强化学习赋予VLMs交错的视觉推理和工具使用能力。动态整合图像搜索、文本搜索和图像裁剪工具来处理细粒度和知识密集的视觉理解挑战。在RL阶段，提出批量归一化组序列策略优化（BN-GSPO）算法来提高训练稳定性并增强模型调用工具和有效推理的能力。

Result: SenseNova-MARS在开源搜索和细粒度图像理解基准测试中达到最先进性能。在搜索导向基准测试中，SenseNova-MARS-8B在MMSearch上得分为67.84，在HR-MMSearch上得分为41.64，超越了Gemini-3-Flash和GPT-5等专有模型。

Conclusion: SenseNova-MARS通过提供有效且稳健的工具使用能力，代表了向代理视觉语言模型迈出的有希望的一步。将发布所有代码、模型和数据集以促进该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的自动驾驶方法主要依赖2D图像，在复杂场景理解和决策中存在空间推理和几何推断不准确的问题，影响安全性和可靠性。

Method: 提出LVLDrive框架，将LiDAR点云作为额外输入模态；设计渐进融合Q-Former逐步注入LiDAR特征，避免破坏预训练模型知识；构建空间感知问答数据集训练3D感知推理能力。

Result: 在自动驾驶基准测试中，LVLDrive在场景理解、度量空间感知和可靠驾驶决策方面均优于纯视觉方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，显式的3D度量数据对于构建可信赖的基于视觉语言模型的自动驾驶系统至关重要。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到狭义相对论和量子力学的启发，作者希望建立一个新的理论框架来理解卷积神经网络中信息处理的机械特性，特别是卷积滤波与整流操作的基本原理。

Method: 将卷积核分解为正交的偶分量和奇分量，偶分量导致图像内容各向同性扩散（类似势能），奇分量导致质心方向性位移（类似动能）。在谱域通过离散余弦变换分析奇偶特性，特别关注小卷积核（如3×3像素）的低频基函数（DC Σ和梯度分量∇）。

Result: 发现信息位移速度与奇分量占总核能量的比例呈线性关系，小卷积滤波器的结构主要由低频基函数主导，这些基函数定义了信息传播的基本模式。首次建立了通用CNN中信息处理与能量-动量关系（现代相对论物理的基石）之间的联系。

Conclusion: 提出的基本信​​息力学模型为理解卷积滤波的机械特性提供了新的理论框架，将CNN中的信息处理与物理学的能量-动量关系联系起来，为深度学习理论提供了物理基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding the mechanical properties of convolutional filtering with rectification, inspired by physical theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics. We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $Σ$ and gradient components $\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation, a cornerstone of modern relativistic physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤病图像数据集主要关注皮肤镜图像，缺乏患者查询和临床上下文，限制了在患者中心护理中的应用。需要更全面的数据集来支持皮肤病视觉语言建模研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有动态模型大小选择方法在处理多样化工作负载（特别是移动视频和低精度目标）时表现不佳，主要问题在于采样成本过高和每段精度预测不准确。

Method: RedunCut采用测量驱动的规划器来估计采样的成本效益权衡，并使用轻量级的数据驱动性能模型来改进精度预测。

Result: 在道路车辆、无人机和监控视频以及多种模型家族和任务中，RedunCut在固定精度下减少14-62%的计算成本，并对有限历史数据和漂移保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RedunCut通过解决采样效率问题和改进精度预测，显著提升了动态模型大小选择在实际多样化工作负载中的性能。

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

Conclusion: DyStream通过创新的因果架构设计，在保证超低延迟的同时实现了高质量的实时双人对话头部视频生成，显著优于现有因果策略

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术技能评估依赖专家监督，存在主观性、评估者间差异大、耗时耗力等问题，在低收入国家难以推广。需要客观、一致、可扩展的自动评估方法。

Method: 提出AI驱动框架：1) 基于TimeSformer的视频Transformer架构，改进为分层时间注意力和加权空间注意力机制；2) 使用YOLO进行目标检测和追踪，提取精细运动特征；3) 从五个方面评估微血管吻合术技能。

Conclusion: 该系统能提供客观、一致、可解释的反馈，有望实现更标准化、数据驱动的手术培训评估，特别是在资源有限环境中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

Motivation: 虽然对Transformer模型工作原理的洞察主要来自语言任务分析，但本研究旨在通过组合性的视角来探究Vision Transformer编码器学习到的表示，以理解ViT如何结构化视觉信息。

Method: 引入一个框架，类似于先前测量表示学习组合性的工作，使用离散小波变换获得输入相关的视觉基元，通过检查组合表示能否重构原始图像表示来实证测试表示空间中的组合性程度。

Result: 研究发现，从一级DWT分解获得的基元产生的编码器表示在潜在空间中近似组合，这表明ViT编码器确实表现出一定程度的组合性结构。

Conclusion: ViT编码器学习到的表示展现出组合性特征，离散小波变换是获取视觉基元的有效工具，这为理解Vision Transformer如何组织视觉信息提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

Motivation: 空间任务中多光谱太阳图像的高保真压缩面临挑战，需要在有限带宽与保持精细光谱空间细节之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出双模块框架：1) iSWGE模块通过图节点表示光谱通道并学习边缘特征，显式建模谱间关系；2) WSGA-C模块结合稀疏图注意力与卷积注意力，减少空间冗余并强调精细结构。

Result: 在SDOML数据集六个极紫外通道上评估，相比强基线：MSID降低20.15%，PSNR提升最高1.09%，log变换MS-SSIM增益1.62%，在相同比特率下提供更锐利且光谱保真的重建。

Conclusion: 该学习型压缩框架能有效平衡带宽限制与多光谱太阳图像的质量保持，为空间任务提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

TL;DR: 提出基于DINOv2特征条件的特征到图像扩散基础模型(F2IDiff FM)，用于智能手机摄影的超分辨率，在保持高保真度的同时避免幻觉生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本到图像扩散基础模型的单图像超分辨率方法在智能手机摄影中存在两个问题：1) 文本特征过于高层，无法描述图像的细微纹理；2) 智能手机LR图像分辨率高(≥12MP)，而现有模型设计用于小图像(<1MP)，需要分块处理，但小块的文本描述不准确。这导致在消费摄影中可能产生不希望的幻觉。

Method: 提出特征到图像扩散基础模型(F2IDiff FM)，使用DINOv2特征作为条件输入。DINOv2特征提供更低层次、更严格的图像特征描述，能够准确描述小图像块的丰富细节，从而实现更精确、幻觉更少的超分辨率。

Result: 该方法能够为智能手机摄影提供高质量的超分辨率，在保持高保真度的同时最小化幻觉生成，解决了现有基于文本条件的扩散模型在消费摄影应用中的局限性。

Conclusion: 通过使用DINOv2等低层次特征作为扩散基础模型的条件，可以更好地控制生成过程，为智能手机相机提供更准确、幻觉更少的超分辨率解决方案，平衡了生成能力和保真度要求。

Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

TL;DR: 该研究提出一个结合YOLO目标检测模型和大型语言模型的管道，用于从胸部X光图像生成放射学报告，比较了YOLOv5和YOLOv8的性能，并评估了GPT-4生成的报告质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医学影像分析中表现出色，但现有系统通常只输出结构化预测，需要放射科医生将其转化为完整的叙述性报告。本研究旨在利用大型语言模型（如GPT-4）来弥合这一差距，自动生成诊断性叙述报告。

Method: 开发了一个集成YOLOv5和YOLOv8进行胸部X光图像异常检测，然后将检测结果（边界框预测和类别标签）输入大型语言模型（GPT-4）生成自然语言放射学报告的管道。比较了两种YOLO模型在检测精度、推理延迟方面的性能，并通过余弦相似度评估生成文本的质量。

Result: 结果显示AI生成报告与人工报告具有强语义相似性。人类评估表明GPT-4在清晰度方面表现优秀（4.88/5），但在自然写作流畅度方面得分较低（2.81/5），表明当前系统能达到临床准确性，但在风格上与放射科医生撰写的文本仍有区别。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了结合目标检测模型和大型语言模型生成放射学报告的可行性，系统在临床准确性方面表现良好，但在自然语言流畅度方面仍需改进，为未来医学影像报告自动化提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频流量激增对带宽和存储基础设施带来巨大压力，传统视频编解码器如H.264和HEVC主要针对像素域重建设计，缺乏对机器学习潜在表示的原生支持，限制了与深度学习管道的集成。

Method: 将VQ-VAE-2框架扩展到时空设置，引入基于3D残差卷积的两级层次潜在结构，模型轻量(约18.5M参数)，针对64x64分辨率视频片段优化，并采用预训练VGG16网络的感知损失提升重建质量。

Result: 在UCF101数据集上训练，使用2秒视频片段(32帧，16FPS)，测试集达到25.96 dB PSNR和0.8375 SSIM，验证集相比单尺度基线提升1.41 dB PSNR和0.0248 SSIM。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于带宽敏感场景的可扩展视频压缩，包括实时流媒体、移动视频分析和CDN级存储优化，特别适合计算和内存资源受限的边缘设备部署。

Abstract: The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to localize specific objects in an image according to natural language expressions, serving as a fundamental task in vision-language understanding. However, existing VG benchmarks are mostly derived from datasets collected under clean environments, such as COCO, where scene diversity is limited. Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground. Experimental results show that our proposed RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms these adapted methods, particularly in nighttime and long-distance scenarios. All resources will be publicly released to promote future research on robust visual grounding in complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: 显式优化决策模糊样本对提升CDVQA模型的判别性和鲁棒性至关重要，DARFT框架能有效解决决策模糊问题且无需额外监督。

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

Conclusion: SliceLens通过假设驱动的视觉推理方法，有效解决了多实例视觉任务中细粒度错误切片发现的挑战，提出的FeSD基准为未来研究提供了更真实的评估标准。

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

Abstract: Tensor network structure search (TN-SS) aims to automatically discover optimal network topologies and rank configurations for efficient tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation. Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.

Motivation: 现有LoRA方法要么牺牲微调性能，要么引入过多可训练参数，无法在学习和参数效率之间取得平衡

Method: 提出协作低秩适应(CLoRA)，包含基础空间共享和样本无关多样性增强(SADE)组件。所有低秩模块共享一组下/上投影空间，通过共享空间获得的低秩矩阵协作构建每个LRM，SADE正则化矩阵间相似性以鼓励多样化表示

Conclusion: CLoRA通过协作低秩适应机制，在保持参数效率的同时扩展低秩模块的学习能力，实现了学习性能和参数效率的更好平衡

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: EVOL-SAM3：一种零样本推理分割框架，通过推理时进化搜索过程，采用"生成-评估-进化"循环迭代优化提示假设，显著超越静态方法和监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理分割方法存在严重问题：监督微调（SFT）会导致灾难性遗忘和领域依赖；强化学习（RL）训练不稳定且依赖预定义奖励函数；训练免费方法受限于静态推理范式，采用单次"生成-分割"链，推理深度不足且无法自我纠正语言幻觉或空间误解。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

Besides, we firstly restore a low-resolution result and use it as global residual to mitigate blocky artifacts caused by patching process.Furthermore, we construct a film restoration dataset that contains restored real-degraded films and realistic synthetic data.Comprehensive experimental results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our model in defect restoration ability over existing open-source methods.

Conclusion: 通过结合径向并行预测和动态输出修正，RadAR为自回归视觉生成提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，平衡了生成质量与推理速度。

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

Abstract: In this work, we show that the impact of model capacity varies across timesteps: it is crucial for the early and late stages but largely negligible during the intermediate stage. Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

Abstract: Compressed deep learning models are crucial for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices. However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要在理想光照条件下评估VLMs，但实际应用中需要24/7运行，包括夜间或黑暗环境，这一核心需求被忽视。需要评估VLMs在低光照条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DarkEQA基准测试，在受控的视觉退化条件下评估第一人称视角问答任务。关键设计特点是物理保真度：在原始RAW空间模拟基于物理的照明下降和传感器噪声，然后通过ISP渲染管道处理。

Result: 评估了多种最先进的VLMs和低光照图像增强模型，系统性地揭示了VLMs在这些挑战性视觉条件下的局限性。

Conclusion: DarkEQA填补了VLMs在低光照条件下评估的空白，为可归因的鲁棒性分析提供了工具，代码和数据集将在接受后发布。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis. However, the rapid proliferation of 3DGS-based algorithms has created a pressing need for standardized and comprehensive evaluation tools, especially for compression task. Existing benchmarks often lack the specific metrics necessary to holistically assess the unique characteristics of different methods, such as rendering speed, rate distortion trade-offs memory efficiency, and geometric accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce Splatwizard, a unified benchmark toolkit designed specifically for benchmarking 3DGS compression models. Splatwizard provides an easy-to-use framework to implement new 3DGS compression model and utilize state-of-the-art techniques proposed by previous work. Besides, an integrated pipeline that automates the calculation of key performance indicators, including image-based quality metrics, chamfer distance of reconstruct mesh, rendering frame rates, and computational resource consumption is included in the framework as well.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型难以独立控制空间（相机视角）和时间（运动序列），缺乏对动态场景进行空间-时间解耦控制的能力。

Method: 1. 引入动画时间嵌入机制实现运动序列的显式控制；2. 提出时间扭曲训练方案，利用多视角数据集模拟时间差异；3. 改进相机条件机制，允许从第一帧开始改变相机；4. 创建CamxTime合成数据集，提供完整的空间-时间视频轨迹。

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot成功实现了视频生成中空间和时间的解耦控制，通过创新的训练方案和数据集构建，为可控生成渲染提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Result: 实验证实该方法成功创建了导致深度误判的对抗样本，使目标场景中的物体部分消失。

Conclusion: 基于DNN的单目深度估计模型存在对抗攻击脆弱性，提出的投影式物理在环攻击方法能有效验证这种脆弱性，强调了在实际应用中增强模型鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

TL;DR: CropTrack是一个针对农业环境多目标跟踪的新框架，通过结合外观和运动信息，解决了重复模式、相似外观和频繁遮挡带来的挑战，在身份保持方面优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业环境中的多目标跟踪面临重复模式、相似外观、光照突变和频繁遮挡等挑战。现有跟踪器主要依赖运动信息，但在频繁强遮挡下难以保持目标身份，而外观相似性使得外观关联在农业场景中难以应用。

Method: 提出CropTrack框架，结合外观和运动信息：1）重排序增强的外观关联；2）一对多关联配合基于外观的冲突解决策略；3）指数移动平均原型特征库来改进基于外观的关联。

Result: 在公开农业MOT数据集上的评估显示，CropTrack在身份保持方面表现一致，优于传统基于运动的跟踪方法。与最先进方法相比，在识别F1分数和关联准确率方面取得显著提升，同时身份切换次数更少。

Conclusion: CropTrack通过有效结合外观和运动信息，解决了农业场景中多目标跟踪的挑战，特别是在频繁遮挡下保持目标身份方面表现出色，为农业MOT提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了VLN-MME框架，用于评估多模态大语言模型在具身导航任务中的零样本能力，发现尽管MLLMs能遵循指令并结构化输出，但其3D空间推理能力较弱，且CoT推理和自反思反而导致性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在多种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但作为具身代理（需要多轮对话空间推理和序列动作预测）的性能仍需探索。本文旨在评估MLLMs在视觉语言导航任务中的零样本能力。

Method: 提出VLN-MME框架，将传统导航数据集标准化为统一基准，采用高度模块化和易访问的设计。通过该框架系统评估不同MLLM架构、代理设计和导航任务，特别测试了思维链推理和自反思对基线代理的影响。

Result: 研究发现增强基线代理的思维链推理和自反思能力反而导致性能下降，表明MLLMs在具身导航任务中上下文感知能力差，虽然能遵循指令并结构化输出，但3D空间推理保真度低。

Conclusion: VLN-MME为系统评估通用MLLMs在具身导航场景中的能力奠定了基础，揭示了其在序列决策能力方面的局限性，这些发现为MLLMs作为具身代理的后训练提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

Motivation: 虽然SAM2在视频分割中表现出色，但将其应用于医学图像分割面临挑战：需要大量标注数据进行微调，且依赖高质量手动提示，这些都需要医学专家参与，成本高昂。

Method: 提出OFL-SAM2框架：1) 在线少样本学习器，用有限数据训练映射网络生成目标特征；2) 自适应融合模块，动态整合目标特征与冻结SAM2生成的内存注意力特征。

Result: 在三个不同的医学图像分割数据集上进行广泛实验，OFL-SAM2在有限训练数据下实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: OFL-SAM2通过消除手动提示需求和支持在线参数更新，为医学图像分割提供了标签高效的解决方案，在少样本场景下表现出色。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated remarkable promptable visual segmentation capabilities in video data, showing potential for extension to medical image segmentation (MIS) tasks involving 3D volumes and temporally correlated 2D image sequences. However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions.

TL;DR: ProDM：一种基于扩散模型的生成框架，用于从非门控胸部CT中恢复无运动钙化病灶，提高冠状动脉钙化评分准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉钙化评分是心血管疾病风险评估的重要工具，但非门控胸部CT存在严重运动伪影，影响钙化病灶的准确量化。虽然心脏门控CT能减少伪影，但在人群筛查和常规成像中应用受限。需要一种方法能从常规非门控CT中恢复无运动钙化病灶。

Method: 提出ProDM（Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model）生成扩散框架，包含三个关键组件：1）CAC运动模拟数据引擎，从心脏门控CT合成具有多样运动轨迹的模拟非门控采集数据；2）属性感知学习策略，通过可微钙化一致性损失融入钙化特异性先验；3）渐进校正方案，在扩散步骤中逐步减少伪影。

Conclusion: 渐进、属性感知的框架在从常规胸部CT成像中进行可靠CAC量化方面具有潜力，为心血管风险评估提供了更广泛可用的替代方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出无需重新索引历史图库图像的终身行人重识别新任务RFL-ReID，并设计双向连续兼容表示框架Bi-C2R解决新旧模型特征兼容性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统终身行人重识别(L-ReID)方法每次更新后需要重新提取历史图库特征（重新索引），但这面临数据隐私问题和计算成本高的挑战。历史图库数据通常无法直接保存，且大规模图库重新索引成本高昂，导致更新后模型提取的查询特征与旧模型提取的图库特征不兼容，严重影响重识别性能。

Method: 提出双向连续兼容表示框架Bi-C2R，通过持续更新旧模型提取的图库特征，以兼容的方式实现高效终身行人重识别。该方法使新旧模型输出的特征相互兼容，避免了重新索引的需求。

Result: 通过理论分析和在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证，Bi-C2R方法在提出的RFL-ReID任务和传统L-ReID任务上均取得了领先性能。

Conclusion: 提出了无需重新索引的终身行人重识别新任务RFL-ReID，比传统L-ReID更具挑战性。Bi-C2R框架通过双向连续兼容表示有效解决了新旧模型特征兼容性问题，为终身学习中的特征兼容性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

Abstract: We present FoundationSLAM, a learning-based monocular dense SLAM system that addresses the absence of geometric consistency in previous flow-based approaches for accurate and robust tracking and mapping. Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

TL;DR: FineTec：一个用于时间损坏骨架序列细粒度动作识别的统一框架，通过上下文感知补全、空间分解和物理驱动估计来恢复细微运动线索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中在线姿态估计常产生大量缺失数据，现有方法难以准确恢复时间动态和细粒度空间结构，导致丢失区分相似动作的关键细微运动线索

Method: 1) 上下文感知补全生成基础骨架序列；2) 空间分解模块将骨架分为5个语义区域，基于运动方差分为动态/静态子组，生成两个增强序列；3) 物理驱动估计模块使用拉格朗日动力学估计关节加速度；4) 融合骨架位置序列和加速度序列输入GCN识别头

Result: 在粗粒度(NTU-60, NTU-120)和细粒度(Gym99, Gym288)基准测试中显著优于现有方法，在Gym99-severe和Gym288-severe上分别达到89.1%和78.1%的top-1准确率

Conclusion: FineTec通过统一的补全、分解和物理驱动估计框架，有效解决了时间损坏骨架序列的细粒度动作识别问题，展示了鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edit3r是一个前馈框架，能够从无姿态、视图不一致的指令编辑图像中单次前向传播完成3D场景重建与编辑，无需逐场景优化或姿态估计，实现快速逼真渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法通常需要逐场景优化，计算成本高且速度慢。同时，缺乏多视图一致的编辑图像作为监督数据，限制了前馈模型的发展。

Method: 1) 使用SAM2重着色策略生成可靠、跨视图一致的监督数据；2) 采用非对称输入策略，将重着色参考视图与原始辅助视图配对，鼓励网络融合和对齐不同观察；3) 构建DL3DV-Edit-Bench基准进行大规模评估。

Result: Edit3r在语义对齐和3D一致性方面优于现有基线方法，同时推理速度显著更快。模型能够有效处理训练中未见的2D方法（如InstructPix2Pix）编辑的图像。

Conclusion: Edit3r实现了快速、逼真的3D场景编辑，无需逐场景优化或姿态估计，在语义对齐和3D一致性方面表现优异，有望应用于实时3D编辑场景。

Abstract: We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.

Conclusion: GaMO通过多视角外推方法有效解决了稀疏视图3D重建中的几何一致性和覆盖范围问题，在保持高质量重建的同时大幅提升计算效率，为实际应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Abstract: Online gaming is a popular activity involving the adoption of complex systems and network infrastructures. The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability to combine data-driven analyses with model-based insights. In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has been widely adopted in diverse industrial domains, including autonomous driving, intelligent healthcare, and aided programming. Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects. These insights highlight promising directions for future exploration in this field.

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的仿真推理为复杂科学问题提供了一种灵活的推理框架，特别是在处理非理想数据条件时具有优势。未来研究方向包括不确定性量化在概率地球物理模型等领域的应用。

Abstract: For complex simulation problems, inferring parameters of scientific interest often precludes the use of classical likelihood-based techniques due to intractable likelihood functions. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\mathbfθ$ given observed data $\mathbf{x}_{\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.

Abstract: Human-level concept learning argues that humans typically learn new concepts from a single example, whereas machine learning algorithms typically require hundreds of samples to learn a single concept. Our brain subconsciously identifies important features and learns more effectively. \vspace*{6pt}
  Contribution: In this paper, we present the Coordinate Matrix Machine (CM$^2$). This purpose-built small model augments human intelligence by learning document structures and using this information to classify documents. While modern "Red AI" trends rely on massive pre-training and energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, CM$^2$ is designed as a Green AI solution. It achieves human-level concept learning by identifying only the structural "important features" a human would consider, allowing it to classify very similar documents using only one sample per class.
  Advantage: Our algorithm outperforms traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models that require larger datasets and significant compute. By focusing on structural coordinates rather than exhaustive semantic vectors, CM$^2$ offers: 1. High accuracy with minimal data (one-shot learning) 2. Geometric and structural intelligence 3. Green AI and environmental sustainability 4. Optimized for CPU-only environments 5. Inherent explainability (glass-box model) 6. Faster computation and low latency 7. Robustness against unbalanced classes 8. Economic viability 9. Generic, expandable, and extendable

Motivation: 先前研究表明，在受控"风洞"设置中训练的小型transformer能够实现精确贝叶斯推理，其训练动态产生编码后验结构的几何基底。本研究旨在探究这种几何特征是否在工业级语言模型中持续存在。

Method: 在Pythia、Phi-2、Llama-3和Mistral系列模型上进行实验，分析最后一层值表示的几何结构。对Pythia-410M在上下文学习期间进行针对性干预，移除或扰动熵对齐轴，并与随机轴干预进行比较。

Result: 发现所有模型最后一层值表示沿单一主导轴组织，该轴位置与预测熵强相关。领域限制提示将该结构压缩为与合成设置中相同的低维流形。针对性干预会选择性破坏局部不确定性几何，但不会导致贝叶斯行为的比例性退化。

Conclusion: 现代语言模型保留了支持贝叶斯推理的几何基底，并沿该基底组织其近似贝叶斯更新。该几何结构是读取不确定性的特权机制，而非单一计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that small transformers trained in controlled "wind-tunnel'' settings can implement exact Bayesian inference, and that their training dynamics produce a geometric substrate -- low-dimensional value manifolds and progressively orthogonal keys -- that encodes posterior structure. We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.
  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 证据深度学习模型虽然能有效量化不确定性，但主观逻辑框架要求证据非负，这导致特定激活函数在低证据区域会产生极小的梯度，引发学习冻结行为，限制了模型的学习能力。

Result: 在四个基准分类问题（MNIST、CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet）、两个少样本分类问题以及盲人脸恢复问题上进行了广泛实验，验证了理论分析并证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，提出的广义正则化证据模型有效解决了激活依赖的学习冻结问题，提高了证据深度学习模型的训练稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Evidential deep learning (EDL) models, based on Subjective Logic, introduce a principled and computationally efficient way to make deterministic neural networks uncertainty-aware. The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior: a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark classification problems (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), two few-shot classification problems, and blind face restoration problem empirically validate the developed theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized regularized evidential models.

*Sheo Yon Jhin,Noseong Park*

TL;DR: HINTS是一个自监督学习框架，通过从时间序列残差中内生提取人类因素（意见动态、记忆、偏见），无需外部数据，提升时间序列预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类决策、情感和集体心理是影响金融经济系统时间动态的复杂因素。现有方法依赖外部数据源（新闻、社交媒体）来捕捉这些因素，但存在高昂的数据依赖成本（财务、计算、实践）。

Method: 提出HINTS自监督学习框架，利用Friedkin-Johnsen意见动态模型作为结构归纳偏置，从时间序列残差中内生提取演化中的社会影响、记忆和偏见模式。提取的人类因素作为注意力图集成到最先进的骨干模型中。

Result: 在9个真实世界和基准数据集上的实验表明，HINTS能持续提升预测准确性。案例研究和消融研究验证了其可解释性，提取的因素与现实世界事件有强语义对齐。

Conclusion: HINTS无需外部数据就能有效提取人类因素，不仅提高了预测性能，还提供了可解释的见解，展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: Human decision-making, emotions, and collective psychology are complex factors that shape the temporal dynamics observed in financial and economic systems. Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, multiple case studies and ablation studies validate the interpretability of HINTS, demonstrating strong semantic alignment between the extracted factors and real-world events, demonstrating the practical utility of HINTS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUSIC框架通过稀疏诱导的多任务神经网络，将部分物理约束与数据驱动学习结合，解决耦合系统中物理约束变量与数据观测变量互斥时的建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统通常由多个耦合变量描述，但通常只有一个变量的控制方程已知，其他变量只能通过数据观测。这种已知物理知识与观测数据之间的不匹配对现有物理信息机器学习方法构成根本挑战，因为这些方法通常假设完全已知控制方程或所有变量都有完整数据可用。

Method: 提出MUSIC（稀疏和不完全约束下的多任务学习）框架，采用稀疏诱导的多任务神经网络，集成部分物理约束与数据驱动学习。使用无网格（随机）采样训练数据和稀疏正则化，产生高度压缩的模型，提高训练和评估效率。

Result: MUSIC能够准确学习复杂耦合系统的解（冲击波解、不连续解、模式形成解），在数据稀缺和噪声条件下始终优于非稀疏公式。该框架在部分观测系统和不完整物理知识建模方面表现出色。

Conclusion: MUSIC为建模部分观测系统和不完整物理知识提供了一种灵活有效的方法，通过稀疏正则化和多任务学习成功解决了物理约束变量与数据观测变量互斥时的建模挑战。

Abstract: Advances in data acquisition and computational methods have accelerated the use of differential equation based modelling for complex systems. Such systems are often described by coupled (or more) variables, yet governing equation is typically available for one variable, while the remaining variable can be accessed only through data. This mismatch between known physics and observed data poses a fundamental challenge for existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, which generally assume either complete knowledge of the governing equations or full data availability across all variables. In this paper, we introduce MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints), a sparsity induced multitask neural network framework that integrates partial physical constraints with data-driven learning to recover full-dimensional solutions of coupled systems when physics-constrained and data-informed variables are mutually exclusive. MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations. These results highlight MUSIC as a flexible and effective approach for modeling partially observed systems with incomplete physical knowledge.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估数据集稳定性的新方法和基准工作流程，用于网络流量分类中检测数据漂移并优化数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络流量分类中，机器学习模型部署后容易因数据过时、协议更新或流量行为变化而性能下降（数据/概念漂移）。现有方法通常直接重新训练模型而不深入调查根本原因，但数据集质量并非总是可靠，需要更深入的分析。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) represents an efficient and popular approach for network traffic classification. However, network traffic classification is a challenging domain, and trained models may degrade soon after deployment due to the obsolete datasets and quick evolution of computer networks as new or updated protocols appear. Moreover, significant change in the behavior of a traffic type (and, therefore, the underlying features representing the traffic) can produce a large and sudden performance drop of the deployed model, known as a data or concept drift. In most cases, complete retraining is performed, often without further investigation of root causes, as good dataset quality is assumed. However, this is not always the case and further investigation must be performed. This paper proposes a novel methodology to evaluate the stability of datasets and a benchmark workflow that can be used to compare datasets.
  The proposed framework is based on a concept drift detection method that also uses ML feature weights to boost the detection performance. The benefits of this work are demonstrated on CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset. We provide the initial dataset stability benchmark that is used to describe dataset stability and weak points to identify the next steps for optimization. Lastly, using the proposed benchmarking methodology, we show the optimization impact on the created dataset variants.

Motivation: 传统逆问题中的最优实验设计通常采用双层优化和间接稀疏正则化方法，这些方法计算复杂且需要调参。需要一种更直接、高效的实验设计框架。

Method: NODE框架在单个优化循环中联合训练神经重建模型和表示传感器位置、采样时间或测量角度的连续设计变量。通过直接优化测量位置而非候选网格加权，实现设计的稀疏性。

Result: 在指数增长基准测试、MNIST图像采样和稀疏视图X射线CT实验中，NODE均优于基线方法，显示出改进的重建精度和任务特定性能。

Conclusion: NODE提供了一种避免传统双层优化和间接稀疏正则化的有效实验设计方法，通过直接优化设计变量实现稀疏性，计算效率更高且性能更好。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Optimal Design of Experiments, a learning-based framework for optimal experimental design in inverse problems that avoids classical bilevel optimization and indirect sparsity regularization. NODE jointly trains a neural reconstruction model and a fixed-budget set of continuous design variables representing sensor locations, sampling times, or measurement angles, within a single optimization loop. By optimizing measurement locations directly rather than weighting a dense grid of candidates, the proposed approach enforces sparsity by design, eliminates the need for l1 tuning, and substantially reduces computational complexity. We validate NODE on an analytically tractable exponential growth benchmark, on MNIST image sampling, and illustrate its effectiveness on a real world sparse view X ray CT example. In all cases, NODE outperforms baseline approaches, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy and task-specific performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流行病学研究中，时间依赖性暴露对生存结果的累积效应建模具有挑战性。传统样条方法需要重复数据转换且计算量大，而现有神经网络方法虽准确但缺乏对累积暴露模式的可解释性。

Method: 提出CENNSurv，一种新颖的深度学习方法，能够从时间依赖性数据中捕捉动态风险关系，同时保持可解释性。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上评估，CENNSurv揭示了慢性环境暴露与关键生存结果之间的多年滞后关联，以及订阅流失前的关键短期行为变化，证明了其建模复杂时间模式的能力和可扩展性改进。

Conclusion: CENNSurv为研究累积效应的研究者提供了一个实用工具，能够提供可解释的见解，解决了传统方法在可扩展性和现有神经网络方法在可解释性方面的不足。

Abstract: In epidemiological research, modeling the cumulative effects of time-dependent exposures on survival outcomes presents a challenge due to their intricate temporal dynamics. Conventional spline-based statistical methods, though effective, require repeated data transformation for each spline parameter tuning, with survival analysis computations relying on the entire dataset, posing difficulties for large datasets. Meanwhile, existing neural network-based survival analysis methods focus on accuracy but often overlook the interpretability of cumulative exposure patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce CENNSurv, a novel deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships from time-dependent data. Evaluated on two diverse real-world datasets, CENNSurv revealed a multi-year lagged association between chronic environmental exposure and a critical survival outcome, as well as a critical short-term behavioral shift prior to subscription lapse. This demonstrates CENNSurv's ability to model complex temporal patterns with improved scalability. CENNSurv provides researchers studying cumulative effects a practical tool with interpretable insights.

*Karim Salta,Michael Kirby,Chris Peterson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SVBF-LBG算法，用可训练的Schubert Variety of Best Fit替代传统子空间均值，在LBG框架中实现更好的聚类纯度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在子空间聚类中，传统方法使用子空间均值作为几何代表，但可能无法充分捕捉子空间数据的几何结构。需要一种能更好表示子空间簇的数学结构，同时保持下游分析所需的几何特性。

Method: 提出Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF)作为可训练原型，定义为与每个簇成员在至少一个固定方向上尽可能接近相交的子空间。将SVBF集成到Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG)管道中，形成SVBF-LBG聚类算法。

Result: 在合成数据、图像数据、光谱数据和视频动作数据上，SVBF-LBG相比传统方法获得了改进的聚类纯度，同时保留了数学结构以便进行下游分析。

Conclusion: SVBF作为子空间簇的代表比传统均值更有效，SVBF-LBG算法在保持几何结构的同时提高了聚类性能，适用于需要数学可解释性的应用场景。

Abstract: In many classification and clustering tasks, it is useful to compute a geometric representative for a dataset or a cluster, such as a mean or median. When datasets are represented by subspaces, these representatives become points on the Grassmann or flag manifold, with distances induced by their geometry, often via principal angles. We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrated in the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline, this SVBF-LBG scheme yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data, while retaining the mathematical structure required for downstream analysis.

TL;DR: MERINDA是一个FPGA加速的模型恢复框架，用于边缘设备上的物理AI，相比GPU方案实现114倍能耗降低、28倍内存减少和1.68倍训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上的物理AI需要硬件高效的学习和推理能力，以实现实时理解和预测真实世界动态。现有模型恢复方法依赖需要迭代求解器的神经ODE公式，难以在边缘硬件上高效加速。

Method: MERINDA用硬件友好的公式替换昂贵的神经ODE组件，结合：(1)基于GRU的离散化动态，(2)密集逆ODE层，(3)稀疏驱动的dropout，(4)轻量级ODE求解器。计算结构支持流式并行，关键内核可在FPGA上完全并行化。

Conclusion: MERINDA能够为边缘设备带来准确、可解释的模型恢复能力，实现对自主系统的实时监控，使物理AI在资源受限设备上变得实用可行。

Abstract: Physical AI at the edge -- enabling autonomous systems to understand and predict real-world dynamics in real time -- requires hardware-efficient learning and inference. Model recovery (MR), which identifies governing equations from sensor data, is a key primitive for safe and explainable monitoring in mission-critical autonomous systems operating under strict latency, compute, and power constraints. However, state-of-the-art MR methods (e.g., EMILY and PINN+SR) rely on Neural ODE formulations that require iterative solvers and are difficult to accelerate efficiently on edge hardware. We present \textbf{MERINDA} (Model Recovery in Reconfigurable Dynamic Architecture), an FPGA-accelerated MR framework designed to make physical AI practical on resource-constrained devices. MERINDA replaces expensive Neural ODE components with a hardware-friendly formulation that combines (i) GRU-based discretized dynamics, (ii) dense inverse-ODE layers, (iii) sparsity-driven dropout, and (iv) lightweight ODE solvers. The resulting computation is structured for streaming parallelism, enabling critical kernels to be fully parallelized on the FPGA. Across four benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, MERINDA delivers substantial gains over GPU implementations: \textbf{114$\times$ lower energy} (434~J vs.\ 49{,}375~J), \textbf{28$\times$ smaller memory footprint} (214~MB vs.\ 6{,}118~MB), and \textbf{1.68$\times$ faster training}, while matching state-of-the-art model-recovery accuracy. These results demonstrate that MERINDA can bring accurate, explainable MR to the edge for real-time monitoring of autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SB-TRPO是一种新的信任域强化学习算法，通过自适应偏置策略更新来满足安全约束，同时保持奖励性能，在安全关键任务中实现安全与性能的最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如拉格朗日法和投影法）在安全关键领域的强化学习中存在不足：要么无法确保接近零的安全违规，要么在面对硬约束时牺牲奖励性能。需要一种能在严格安全约束下同时最大化奖励的新方法。

Method: 提出Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO)，这是一种用于硬约束RL的信任域算法。它使用成本和奖励的自然策略梯度的凸组合进行信任域更新，确保每一步都有固定比例的最优成本减少，自适应地将策略更新偏向约束满足，同时仍寻求奖励改进。

Result: 在标准且具有挑战性的Safety Gymnasium任务上的实验表明，SB-TRPO相比最先进方法，始终实现了安全与有意义任务完成的最佳平衡。理论分析提供了局部安全进展的保证，并在梯度适当对齐时确保奖励改进。

Conclusion: SB-TRPO通过自适应偏置策略更新，在严格安全约束下有效平衡了安全性和任务性能，为安全关键领域的强化学习提供了有理论保证的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical domains requires agents to maximise rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints. Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned. Experiments on standard and challenging Safety Gymnasium tasks show that SB-TRPO consistently achieves the best balance of safety and meaningful task completion compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Futures are contracts obligating the exchange of an asset at a predetermined date and price, notable for their high leverage and liquidity and, therefore, thrive in the Crypto market. RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.

Key innovations include an R-style formula interface for accessibility, support for directed acyclic graph (DAG) constraints for causal structure learning, Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) kernels for spatial modeling, and comprehensive interpretability tools including SHAP values and variance decomposition. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility through applications to longitudinal data analysis, genomic prediction, and spatial-temporal modeling. TabMixNN provides a unified interface for researchers to leverage deep learning while maintaining the interpretability and theoretical grounding of classical mixed-effects models.

Abstract: Recent attacks on critical infrastructure, including the 2021 Oldsmar water treatment breach and 2023 Danish energy sector compromises, highlight urgent security gaps in Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. While Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection, existing frameworks remain vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and lack robust agent authentication. We propose Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning (ZTA-FL), a defense in depth framework combining: (1) TPM-based cryptographic attestation achieving less than 0.0000001 false acceptance rate, (2) a novel SHAP-weighted aggregation algorithm providing explainable Byzantine detection under non-IID conditions with theoretical guarantees, and (3) privacy-preserving on-device adversarial training. Comprehensive experiments across three IDS benchmarks (Edge-IIoTset, CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15) demonstrate that ZTA-FL achieves 97.8 percent detection accuracy, 93.2 percent accuracy under 30 percent Byzantine attacks (outperforming FLAME by 3.1 percent, p less than 0.01), and 89.3 percent adversarial robustness while reducing communication overhead by 34 percent.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the private and robust alignment of language models from a theoretical perspective by establishing upper bounds on the suboptimality gap in both offline and online settings. We consider preference labels subject to privacy constraints and/or adversarial corruption, and analyze two distinct interplays between them: privacy-first and corruption-first. For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime. In addition, we also present the first set of results for private and robust online alignment. Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence guarantees for log loss and square loss under privacy and corruption, which we believe have broad applicability across learning theory and statistics.

TL;DR: MS-SSM提出多尺度状态空间模型框架，通过多分辨率处理解决传统SSM内存有限和难以捕捉多尺度依赖的问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升序列建模性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统状态空间模型(SSMs)虽然计算高效，但存在有效内存有限、需要更大状态尺寸来改善记忆的问题，且难以捕捉多尺度依赖关系，而多尺度依赖对于时间序列、图像和自然语言中的复杂结构建模至关重要。

Method: 提出多尺度SSM框架，在多个分辨率上表示序列动态，每个分辨率使用专门的状态空间动态处理；引入输入相关的尺度混合器，实现跨分辨率的动态信息融合，从而同时捕捉细粒度高频模式和粗粒度全局趋势。

Result: 在Long Range Arena、层次推理、时间序列分类和图像识别等基准测试中，MS-SSM一致优于先前的SSM模型，显著提升了序列建模性能，特别是在长距离和层次化任务中，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 多分辨率处理在状态空间架构中具有显著优势，MS-SSM通过多尺度框架有效解决了传统SSM的局限性，在提升记忆效率和长距离建模能力的同时保持了计算效率，为序列建模提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently attention as an efficient alternative to computationally expensive attention-based models for sequence modeling. They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling. We further introduce an input-dependent scale-mixer, enabling dynamic information fusion across resolutions. The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including Long Range Arena, hierarchical reasoning, time series classification, and image recognition, demonstrate that MS-SSM consistently outperforms prior SSM-based models, highlighting the benefits of multi-resolution processing in state-space architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bridge-TS提出了一种基于数据到数据生成过程的时间序列插补方法，通过专家先验和组合先验设计，显著提高了生成式时间序列插补的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式时间序列插补方法（如扩散概率模型和Schrödinger桥模型）使用高斯噪声或线性插值作为先验，这些先验缺乏对真实目标的信息，导致生成过程负担增加且插补精度有限。

Method: 1. 提出专家先验：使用预训练的基于Transformer的模块作为专家，对缺失值进行确定性估计，并将结果作为真实目标的先验。2. 探索组合先验：利用多个预训练模型提供不同的估计结果，在数据到数据生成过程中组合它们，实现组合先验到目标的插补过程。

Result: 在ETT、Exchange和Weather等多个基准数据集上的实验表明，Bridge-TS在均方误差和平均绝对误差方面达到了新的插补精度记录。

Conclusion: 通过改进先验设计，Bridge-TS证明了在生成式时间序列插补中提高先验信息质量的重要性，为时间序列插补任务提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Time series imputation, i.e., filling the missing values of a time recording, finds various applications in electricity, finance, and weather modelling. Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.

TL;DR: Trellis是一种新型Transformer架构，通过固定大小内存和两轮循环压缩机制动态压缩KV缓存，解决了传统Transformer二次计算复杂度和KV缓存无限增长的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer存在二次计算复杂度和不断增长的KV缓存问题，这限制了其在长序列应用中的效率。需要一种能够动态压缩内存的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: Trellis用固定大小内存替换标准KV缓存，训练一个两轮循环压缩机制，使用带有遗忘门的在线梯度下降过程，递归更新压缩内存并学习在测试时保留重要上下文信息。

Result: 在语言建模、常识推理、召回密集型任务和时间序列上的广泛实验表明，该架构优于强基线模型。随着序列长度增加，性能提升更加明显，显示出其在长上下文应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: Trellis通过有界内存和动态压缩机制有效解决了Transformer的计算和内存问题，特别适合长序列处理，为长上下文应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers, while powerful, suffer from quadratic computational complexity and the ever-growing Key-Value (KV) cache of the attention mechanism. This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines. Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.

Abstract: Neural processes (NPs) are a class of models that learn stochastic processes directly from data and can be used for inference, sampling and conditional sampling. We introduce a new NP model based on flow matching, a generative modeling paradigm that has demonstrated strong performance on various data modalities. Following the NP training framework, the model provides amortized predictions of conditional distributions over any arbitrary points in the data. Compared to previous NP models, our model is simple to implement and can be used to sample from conditional distributions using an ODE solver, without requiring auxiliary conditioning methods. In addition, the model provides a controllable tradeoff between accuracy and running time via the number of steps in the ODE solver. We show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural process methods on various benchmarks including synthetic 1D Gaussian processes data, 2D images, and real-world weather data.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了小型语言模型的小规模预训练，重点研究了Infini-attention机制在提升紧凑模型长上下文外推能力方面的效果，发现尽管存在性能衰减，但Infini-attention仍能显著提升长上下文检索准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决小型语言模型在有限数据和计算资源下的高效使用问题，提高低资源环境下的可访问性并降低成本，同时增强紧凑模型的长上下文外推能力。

Method: 采用Infini-attention机制，该机制从过去的文本段构建压缩记忆同时保留局部注意力。研究使用300M参数的LLaMA模型进行预训练，并对Infini-attention进行实证研究，特别关注平衡因子对模型性能的影响。

Result: Infini-attention模型表现出训练稳定性，在长上下文检索任务中优于基线模型。研究发现平衡因子是关键性能因素，同时发现随着长序列中记忆压缩的重复，检索准确率会下降。尽管如此，在16,384个token的上下文长度下，Infini-attention模型仍能比基线获得高达31%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，在小型语言模型中实现稳健的长上下文能力可以从Infini-attention这类架构性记忆中获益，该机制能有效补偿SLM有限参数带来的限制。

Abstract: This study investigates small-scale pretraining for Small Language Models (SLMs) to enable efficient use of limited data and compute, improve accessibility in low-resource settings and reduce costs. To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline. Our findings suggest that achieving robust long-context capability in SLMs benefits from architectural memory like Infini-attention.

Motivation: 传统SAC算法中基于能量的策略通常使用简单策略类进行近似，牺牲了表达能力和鲁棒性。本文旨在利用流模型的丰富表达能力来改进SAC算法。

Method: 提出基于流模型的SAC变体算法，使用瞬时变量变化技术评估流策略，并开发了重要性采样流匹配（ISFM）在线更新策略。ISFM允许仅使用用户指定采样分布的样本而非未知目标分布进行策略更新。

Result: 开发了ISFM的理论分析，阐明了不同采样分布选择对学习效率的影响。在最大熵线性二次调节器问题上进行案例研究，证明算法能够学习最优动作分布。

Conclusion: 通过将流模型集成到SAC框架中，结合ISFM在线更新技术，实现了更富表达能力的最大熵强化学习算法，在理论分析和实验验证中均表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a popular algorithm for max-entropy reinforcement learning. In practice, the energy-based policies in SAC are often approximated using simple policy classes for efficiency, sacrificing the expressiveness and robustness. In this paper, we propose a variant of the SAC algorithm that parameterizes the policy with flow-based models, leveraging their rich expressiveness. In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper. This online variant, termed importance sampling flow matching (ISFM), enables policy update with only samples from a user-specified sampling distribution rather than the unknown target distribution. We develop a theoretical analysis of ISFM, characterizing how different choices of sampling distributions affect the learning efficiency. Finally, we conduct a case study of our algorithm on the max-entropy linear quadratic regulator problems, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm learns the optimal action distribution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球水平辐照度（GHI）的可靠预测对于缓解太阳能并网波动至关重要。现有研究缺乏对新兴深度学习架构（如Transformer、Mamba等）在GHI预测中的系统性比较，需要评估不同架构的性能差异和可解释性。

Method: 使用胡志明市2011-2020年高分辨率NSRDB卫星数据，对10种深度学习架构进行1小时前GHI时间序列预测基准测试，包括LSTM、TCN、Transformer、Informer、iTransformer、TSMixer和Mamba等。采用SHAP分析对比不同架构的时间推理模式，并通过知识蒸馏压缩高性能模型。

Result: Transformer架构表现最佳，R²达到0.9696。SHAP分析显示：Transformer具有"近期偏好"，主要关注即时大气条件；而Mamba则明确利用24小时周期性依赖关系。知识蒸馏成功将Transformer压缩23.5%，同时降低误差（MAE：23.78 W/m²）。

Abstract: Reliable forecasting of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is essential for mitigating the variability of solar energy in power grids. This study presents a comprehensive benchmark of ten deep learning architectures for short-term (1-hour ahead) GHI time series forecasting in Ho Chi Minh City, leveraging high-resolution NSRDB satellite data (2011-2020) to compare established baselines (e.g. LSTM, TCN) against emerging state-of-the-art architectures, including Transformer, Informer, iTransformer, TSMixer, and Mamba. Experimental results identify the Transformer as the superior architecture, achieving the highest predictive accuracy with an R^2 of 0.9696. The study further utilizes SHAP analysis to contrast the temporal reasoning of these architectures, revealing that Transformers exhibit a strong "recency bias" focused on immediate atmospheric conditions, whereas Mamba explicitly leverages 24-hour periodic dependencies to inform predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Knowledge Distillation can compress the high-performance Transformer by 23.5% while surprisingly reducing error (MAE: 23.78 W/m^2), offering a proven pathway for deploying sophisticated, low-latency forecasting on resource-constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: SPM是一种高效的结构化线性算子，可替代密集线性层，在降低计算和参数成本的同时，通过组合归纳偏置改善泛化性能，适用于前馈网络、循环架构、注意力机制等多种场景。

Abstract: Dense linear layers are a dominant source of computational and parametric cost in modern machine learning models, despite their quadratic complexity and often being misaligned with the compositional structure of learned representations. We introduce Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator that replaces dense matrices with a composition of sparse pairwise-mixing stages. An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure. We present proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating substantial reductions in wall-clock cost and improved accuracy on structured learning problems, while retaining competitive performance on real-world benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统深度学习关注无约束优化，但生物系统在严格代谢约束下运作。作者认为这些物理约束不是限制，而是形成时间归纳偏置，促进泛化能力。研究动机是探索约束如何塑造动态以提升泛化，而非视为限制。

Method: 通过相空间分析信号传播，揭示扩张动态放大噪声，而适当耗散动态压缩相空间并与网络谱偏置对齐，迫使抽象不变特征。这种条件可通过输入编码外部施加，或通过网络自身时间动态内在实现。需要能够时间积分和适当约束的架构来解码诱导不变性，而静态架构无法利用时间结构。

Result: 在监督分类、无监督重建和零样本强化学习的综合评估中，证明临界"过渡"机制最大化泛化能力。这种机制通过约束诱导的时间动态促进特征抽象和不变性学习。

Conclusion: 动态约束构成一类独特的归纳偏置，表明稳健AI发展不仅需要扩展和移除限制，还需要计算上掌握自然促进泛化的时间特性。物理约束应被视为塑造泛化能力的时间偏置，而非单纯限制。

Abstract: Conventional deep learning prioritizes unconstrained optimization, yet biological systems operate under strict metabolic constraints. We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical "transition" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, yet many of its most effective methods rely on access to large amounts of labeled data or extensive online interaction. In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making. Overall, this dissertation advances the theoretical foundations of interactive learning by developing algorithms that are statistically optimal and computationally efficient, while also providing principled guidance for deploying interactive learning methods in large-scale, real-world settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种处理类别不平衡的替代损失函数：广义对数调整(GLA)损失和广义类别感知(GCA)损失，理论分析显示GCA在高度不平衡场景下具有更强的理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平衡损失函数虽然能促进公平性，但直接最小化通常不可行，需要设计有效的替代损失函数来处理类别不平衡问题。

Method: 提出两种替代损失函数族：1) GLA损失 - 将基于类别先验调整对数的Logit-Adjusted损失推广到广义交叉熵族；2) GCA损失 - 扩展标准类别加权损失，加入类别相关的置信度边界并推广到广义交叉熵族。

Result: 理论分析表明：GLA损失是贝叶斯一致的，但仅对完整假设集是H一致的，其H一致界与最小类别概率成反比(1/p_min)；GCA损失对任何有界或完整假设集都是H一致的，其一致界更优(1/√p_min)。实验显示两者都优于简单类别加权损失和LA损失。

Conclusion: GCA损失在高度不平衡设置中具有更强的理论保证，GLA在常见基准测试中表现略好，GCA在高度不平衡场景中略有优势，两种方法都显著改进了现有技术。

Abstract: The balanced loss is a widely adopted objective for multi-class classification under class imbalance. By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\mathsf p_{\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\sqrt{\mathsf p_{\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their quantized counterparts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, posing a significant threat of IP theft. Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, combining our quantization technique with other defense mechanisms improves their effectiveness compared to traditional QAT.

Abstract: Flood models inform strategic disaster management by simulating the spatiotemporal hydrodynamics of flooding. While physics-based numerical flood models are accurate, their substantial computational cost limits their use in operational settings where rapid predictions are essential. Models designed with graph neural networks (GNNs) provide both speed and accuracy while having the ability to process unstructured spatial domains. Given its flexible input and architecture, GNNs can be leveraged alongside physics-informed techniques with ease, significantly improving interpretability. This study introduces a novel flood GNN architecture, DUALFloodGNN, which embeds physical constraints at both global and local scales through explicit loss terms. The model jointly predicts water volume at nodes and flow along edges through a shared message-passing framework. To improve performance for autoregressive inference, model training is conducted with a multi-step loss enhanced with dynamic curriculum learning. Compared with standard GNN architectures and state-of-the-art GNN flood models, DUALFloodGNN achieves substantial improvements in predicting multiple hydrologic variables while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DataFlow是一个用于在无限时间序列数据上构建、测试和部署高性能机器学习系统的计算框架，通过基于DAG的统一执行模型和点对点幂等性保证，解决传统批处理到流式生产转换中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据科学工作流假设有限数据集，从批处理原型迁移到流式生产系统时需要大量重新实现，导致因果性违规、批处理边界伪影和实时故障难以复现等问题。

Method: 采用基于有向无环图（DAG）的统一执行模型，具有点对点幂等性：任何时间t的输出仅依赖于t之前的固定长度上下文窗口。框架通过自动跟踪所有转换的知识时间来强制严格因果性，支持跨时间和特征维度的灵活分块。

Result: DataFlow确保在批处理模式下开发的模型无需代码更改即可在流式生产中相同执行，消除未来窥视错误，支持在线学习、缓存和增量计算，以及通过DAG调度自动并行化。

Conclusion: DataFlow有效解决了批处理到流式生产的转换问题，在金融交易、物联网、欺诈检测和实时分析等多个领域展示了其有效性，为时间序列机器学习系统提供了统一的开发和生产框架。

Abstract: We present DataFlow, a computational framework for building, testing, and deploying high-performance machine learning systems on unbounded time-series data. Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.
  DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes. The framework enforces strict causality by automatically tracking knowledge time across all transformations, eliminating future-peeking bugs.
  DataFlow supports flexible tiling across temporal and feature dimensions, allowing the same model to operate at different frequencies and memory profiles via configuration alone. It integrates natively with the Python data science stack and provides fit/predict semantics for online learning, caching and incremental computation, and automatic parallelization through DAG-based scheduling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across domains including financial trading, IoT, fraud detection, and real-time analytics.

TL;DR: 论文提出生成式AI正从对话助手转向自主决策系统，这产生了自主性悖论：自主性越高，越需要更强的形式化结构、约束和尾部风险控制。作者基于运筹学开发了一个保证自主性的概念框架，包含基于流的生成模型和对抗鲁棒性两种互补方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI正从对话助手转向自主决策系统（能够感知、决策和行动的代理系统），这种转变产生了自主性悖论：随着系统获得更大的操作自主权，它们需要更多的形式化结构、明确的约束和更强的尾部风险控制。随机生成模型在操作领域可能很脆弱，需要可验证的可行性、对分布偏移的鲁棒性以及高风险场景下的压力测试机制。

Method: 开发了一个基于运筹学的保证自主性概念框架，包含两种互补方法：1）基于流的生成模型，将生成视为由常微分方程描述的确定性传输，支持可审计性、约束感知生成，并与最优传输、鲁棒优化和顺序决策控制相关联；2）通过对抗鲁棒性视角制定操作安全性，在不确定性或模糊集内评估决策规则对最坏情况扰动的鲁棒性，将未建模风险纳入设计。

Result: 该框架阐明了随着自主性增加，运筹学的角色如何从求解器转变为护栏再到系统架构师，负责控制逻辑、激励协议、监控机制和安全边界。这些元素为安全关键、可靠性敏感的操作领域中的保证自主性定义了一个研究议程。

Conclusion: 生成式AI向自主系统的转变需要更强的形式化保证和风险控制机制。基于运筹学的保证自主性框架通过基于流的生成模型和对抗鲁棒性方法，为解决自主性悖论提供了理论基础，并为安全关键领域的自主系统设计指明了研究方向。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is shifting from conversational assistants toward agentic systems -- autonomous decision-making systems that sense, decide, and act within operational workflows. This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.

*Sebastián Gutiérrez-Bernal,Hector Medel Cobaxin,Abiel Galindo González*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息论的嵌入质量评估新指标ERPM，通过分析邻域矩阵的奇异值谱和稳定秩来量化信息损失，相比传统距离或几何指标能更全面地评估降维效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标如应力、基于排名的邻域标准或局部Procrustes主要关注距离或局部几何的失真，但未能直接评估高维数据投影到低维空间时信息保留的程度。需要从信息论角度直接量化信息损失。

Method: 提出熵秩保持度量(ERPM)，基于邻域矩阵奇异值谱的香农熵和稳定秩，量化原始表示与降维投影之间的不确定性变化。该方法提供邻域级指标和全局汇总统计。

Result: 在金融时间序列和常用流形数据集上验证，发现基于距离的指标与几何和谱度量相关性很低，而ERPM与局部Procrustes显示强平均相关性但在局部区域存在显著差异。ERPM能识别信息损失严重的邻域。

Conclusion: ERPM作为现有指标的补充，通过识别信息损失严重的邻域，实现了对嵌入的更全面评估，特别适用于构建早期预警指标等对信息敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: In this work we study the quality of low-dimensional embeddings from an explicitly information-theoretic perspective. We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.

TL;DR: CLEAR-HUG是一个两阶段心电图自监督学习框架，通过捕捉心脏传导的细微变化并遵循心电图诊断指南，在六个任务上实现了6.84%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心电图自监督学习方法存在两个关键局限：1) 只关注导联和心跳间的一致性模式，忽略了心脏传导过程中固有的心跳差异，而这些细微变化携带独特的生理特征；2) 没有遵循心电图诊断指南的从单个心跳到单导联再到导联组合的渐进逻辑。

Method: 提出两阶段框架CLEAR-HUG：第一阶段是自监督学习模型CLEAR（Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor），采用稀疏注意力机制将每个心跳视为独立实体进行信号重建，捕捉特定变化和一般共性；第二阶段是HUG（Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head）用于疾病诊断，模拟临床工作流程。

Result: 在六个任务上的实验结果显示，CLEAR-HUG相比现有方法实现了6.84%的性能提升，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CLEAR-HUG能够增强心脏传导的表征学习，并使学习到的模式与专家诊断指南保持一致，为心电图分析提供了更有效的自监督学习框架。

Abstract: The multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) stands as a cornerstone of cardiac diagnosis. Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.

TL;DR: HyperGRL提出了一种基于超球面的图表示学习框架，通过自适应邻居均值对齐和无采样均匀性两个对抗耦合目标，在超球面上嵌入节点，避免了传统对比学习方法中的复杂架构和负采样需求。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表示学习方法通常依赖代理对比目标或互信息最大化，需要复杂架构、负采样策略和敏感的超参数调优，可能导致过平滑、过压缩和训练不稳定问题。

Method: HyperGRL通过两个对抗耦合目标在单位超球面上嵌入节点：1) 邻居均值对齐目标，使用每个节点局部邻域的均值表示构建语义基础稳定的目标；2) 无采样均匀性目标，通过L2基超球面正则化实现分散，鼓励全局均匀嵌入分布。还引入了熵引导的自适应平衡机制来动态调节对齐和均匀性之间的相互作用。

Result: 在节点分类、节点聚类和链接预测任务上的广泛实验表明，HyperGRL在表示质量和泛化能力方面优于现有最强方法，分别实现了平均1.49%、0.86%和0.74%的改进。

Conclusion: 基于几何基础的无采样对比目标在图表示学习中具有有效性，HyperGRL框架通过自适应邻居均值对齐和均匀性目标，提供了稳定且高质量的图表示学习解决方案。

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) aims to encode structural and semantic dependencies of graph-structured data into low-dimensional embeddings. However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display strikingly different generalization behaviors: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often narrows capability, whereas reinforcement-learning (RL) tuning tends to preserve it. The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization.

Abstract: We consider the design of mixing matrices to minimize the operation cost for decentralized federated learning (DFL) in wireless networks, with focus on minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption. As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices.

Conclusion: 将物理启发交互特征与学习的时间表示相结合，能够实现鲁棒的多场景车道变换意图预测，为自动驾驶安全提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Lane-change intention prediction is safety-critical for autonomous driving and ADAS, but remains difficult in naturalistic traffic due to noisy kinematics, severe class imbalance, and limited generalization across heterogeneous highway scenarios. We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s. TPI-AI outperforms standalone LightGBM and Bi-LSTM baselines, achieving macro-F1 of 0.9562, 0.9124, 0.8345 on highD and 0.9247, 0.8197, 0.7605 on exiD at T = 1, 2, 3 s, respectively. These results show that combining physics-informed interaction features with learned temporal embeddings yields robust multi-scenario lane-change intention prediction.

Abstract: This paper provides an ablation-based analysis of latent autoregression in GP-VAE models, building upon our previous work introducing the architecture. Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling. They should be interpreted as an empirical analysis of representational structure rather than as a proposal for a new architecture.

Abstract: We demonstrate an approach for LLMs to critique their \emph{own} answers with the goal of enhancing their performance that leads to significant improvements over established planning benchmarks. Despite the findings of earlier research that has cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs leveraging self critique methods, we show significant performance gains on planning datasets in the Blocksworld domain through intrinsic self-critique, without external source such as a verifier. We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement. We illustrate how self-critique can significantly boost planning performance. Our empirical results present new state-of-the-art on the class of models considered, namely LLM model checkpoints from October 2024. Our primary focus lies on the method itself, demonstrating intrinsic self-improvement capabilities that are applicable regardless of the specific model version, and we believe that applying our method to more complex search techniques and more capable models will lead to even better performance.

Conclusion: OptRot和OptRot⁺是有效的旋转方法，能够减少LLM量化中的异常值问题，在W4A8设置中表现优异，但在W4A4设置中存在权重和激活量化的权衡，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: The presence of outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) weights and activations makes them difficult to quantize. Recent work has leveraged rotations to mitigate these outliers. In this work, we propose methods that learn fusible rotations by minimizing principled and cheap proxy objectives to the weight quantization error. We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance. In the W4A4 setting, we see that both OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ perform worse, highlighting a trade-off between weight and activation quantization.

Motivation: 扩散模型通过在线强化学习进行微调时，由于代理奖励与真实目标不匹配，常导致奖励黑客问题（代理分数上升但真实图像质量下降、生成多样性崩溃）。现有基于参考策略的正则化方法会牺牲样本效率并阻碍对新高奖励区域的探索。

Method: 提出GARDO框架：1）选择性正则化：仅惩罚高不确定性样本；2）自适应正则化：定期更新参考模型以匹配在线策略能力；3）多样性感知优化：奖励高质量且高多样性的样本，鼓励模式覆盖。

Result: 在多种代理奖励和未见指标上的实验表明，GARDO能有效缓解奖励黑客、增强生成多样性，同时不牺牲样本效率或探索能力，显示出其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GARDO通过选择性正则化、自适应参考模型更新和多样性感知奖励，解决了扩散模型RL微调中的核心挑战，实现了奖励黑客缓解、多样性保持和高效探索的平衡。

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

*Qianyi Chen,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种改进共形预测条件覆盖的方法，通过优化分位数回归组件来最小化条件覆盖的均方误差，使用密度加权的pinball损失和三头分位数网络进行实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测虽然能提供稳健的边际覆盖保证，但对于特定输入实现可靠的条件覆盖仍然具有挑战性。虽然精确的无分布条件覆盖在有限样本下是不可能的，但现有方法主要关注放松的条件覆盖概念，而非直接优化条件覆盖性能。

Method: 通过泰勒展开推导出分位数回归的代理目标：密度加权的pinball损失，权重由符合性分数在真实分位数处的条件密度给出。提出三头分位数网络，使用辅助分位数水平通过有限差分估计这些权重，然后通过优化加权损失微调中心分位数。

Result: 提供了具有精确非渐近保证的理论分析，表征了由此产生的超额风险。在多样化的高维真实数据集上的广泛实验显示，条件覆盖性能有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接最小化条件覆盖的均方误差，显著提升了共形预测的条件覆盖性能，为改进分位数回归组件提供了一种有效途径。

Abstract: While conformal prediction provides robust marginal coverage guarantees, achieving reliable conditional coverage for specific inputs remains challenging. Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \(1-α\pm δ\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable improvements in conditional coverage performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出配对种子评估设计，通过让竞争系统在相同随机种子下评估，利用随机性共享来减少方差，提高统计效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统本质上是确定性的随机（基于种子的伪随机数生成器），但在比较算法、设计选择和干预措施时，由于随机初始化和学习随机性，评估结果往往具有高方差。标准的独立评估设计未能充分利用不同方案之间的共享随机源。

Method: 提出配对种子评估设计，让竞争系统在相同的随机种子下进行评估，从而诱导随机组件的匹配实现。当结果在种子级别正相关时，这种方法能实现严格的方差减少。

Result: 配对种子评估能产生更紧的置信区间、更高的统计功效，并在固定计算预算下获得有效的样本量增益。实证表明，种子级别的相关性通常很大且为正，能产生数量级的效率提升。

Conclusion: 配对种子评估在实践中是弱占优的：当相关性存在时提高统计可靠性，当相关性不存在时退化为独立评估而不损失有效性。这种方法能显著提升机器学习系统比较评估的统计效率。

Abstract: Machine learning systems appear stochastic but are deterministically random, as seeded pseudorandom number generators produce identical realisations across executions. Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.

Abstract: Plasma kinetic equations exhibit pronounced sensitivity to microscopic perturbations in model parameters and data, making reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) essential for predictive simulations. However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.

Abstract: Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, results in significant mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs. The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring. The models were initially tailored for a prediction window of one hour, later extended to four hours through transfer learning. The encouraging outcomes of this study suggest the potential for wearable technology to facilitate early sepsis detection outside ICU and ward environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SaM2B框架，通过可靠性感知的动态权重分配和跨模态对比学习，解决无人机通信中多模态波束预测的模态可靠性波动和模态失配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济快速发展，无人机通信需要快速准确的波束预测。现有多模态方法大多采用固定或经验权重，假设各模态在任何时刻都同等可靠，但实际上不同模态的重要性随无人机运动场景剧烈波动，静态权重会放大退化模态的负面影响，且模态失配和弱对齐进一步削弱跨场景泛化能力。

Method: 提出SaM2B框架：1）利用环境视觉、飞行姿态和地理空间数据等轻量级线索，通过可靠性感知的动态权重更新机制，在不同时间点自适应分配各模态的贡献；2）采用跨模态对比学习，将与特定波束信息相关的"多源表示波束语义"对齐到共享语义空间，增强判别能力和模态噪声及分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Result: 在真实世界低空无人机数据集上的实验表明，SaM2B相比基线方法取得了更令人满意的结果。

Conclusion: SaM2B通过可靠性感知的动态权重分配和跨模态语义对齐，有效解决了多模态波束预测中的模态可靠性波动和泛化问题，为低空经济中的无人机通信提供了更可靠的连接保障。

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly expanding driven by urban air mobility, logistics drones, and aerial sensing, while fast and accurate beam prediction in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications is crucial for achieving reliable connectivity. Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the "multi-source representation beam semantics" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的拉普拉斯近似在处理现代深度模型的各向异性、弯曲损失表面和大对称群时表现不佳，需要更适应这种结构的几何高斯近似方法。

Method: 提出管状黎曼拉普拉斯(TRL)近似，将后验建模为沿着由函数对称性诱导的低损失谷的概率管状结构，使用Fisher/高斯-牛顿度量将先验主导的切向不确定性与数据主导的横向不确定性分离。

Conclusion: TRL有效地弥合了单模型效率和集成级可靠性之间的差距，是一种可扩展的重新参数化高斯近似方法，利用隐式曲率估计在高维参数空间中运行。

Abstract: Laplace approximations are among the simplest and most practical methods for approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks, yet their Euclidean formulation struggles with the highly anisotropic, curved loss surfaces and large symmetry groups that characterize modern deep models. Recent work has proposed Riemannian and geometric Gaussian approximations to adapt to this structure. Building on these ideas, we introduce the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation. TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost. TRL effectively bridges the gap between single-model efficiency and ensemble-grade reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal intelligence development recently show strong progress in visual understanding and high level reasoning. Though, most reasoning system still reply on textual information as the main medium for inference. This limit their effectiveness in spatial tasks such as visual navigation and geo-localization. This work discuss about the potential scope of this field and eventually propose an idea visual reasoning paradigm Geo-Consistent Visual Planning, our introduced framework called Visual Reasoning for Localization, or ViReLoc, which performs planning and localization using only visual representations. The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance. These results establish visual reasoning as a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization, and show that such tasks can be performed without real time global positioning system data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.

Conclusion: 提出的半参数框架为IRL和DDC模型提供了计算可行且统计有效的推断方法，统一了两种传统上分离的方法，支持灵活的非参数估计同时保持统计保证。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models explain sequential decision-making by recovering reward functions that rationalize observed behavior. Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency. Our framework extends classical inference for DDC models to nonparametric rewards and modern machine-learning tools, providing a unified and computationally tractable approach to statistical inference in IRL.

Abstract: High-dimensional learning problems, where the number of features exceeds the sample size, often require sparse regularization for effective prediction and variable selection. While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics.

Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit strong sensitivity to initial conditions and often contain unresolved multiscale processes, making deterministic forecasting fundamentally limited. Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.

Motivation: 观测数据的因果发现受限于可识别性约束，现有LLM作为先验因果知识的方法缺乏理论基础，需要形式化的数学框架来整合LLM的因果知识。

Method: 使用层理论形式化LLM引导的因果发现：将局部因果信念表示为变量子集上预层的截面；全局因果结构对应全局截面的存在性；拓扑障碍表现为非零层上同调；提出代数潜在投影处理隐混淆变量，并在信念流形上使用自然梯度下降进行优化。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，HOLOGRAPH在50-100个变量的因果发现任务上实现竞争性性能；层理论分析显示恒等、传递和粘合公理在数值精度内满足，但局部性公理在较大图中失效，表明潜在变量投影中存在非局部耦合。

Conclusion: HOLOGRAPH为LLM引导的因果发现提供了严格的数学基础，揭示了因果结构中的拓扑约束，并为处理隐变量和优化提供了理论框架，同时指出了局部性公理失效的重要理论发现。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data remains fundamentally limited by identifiability constraints. Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

Abstract: Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of "fair" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了在线学习算法可以同时处理时间和深度的信用分配问题，为训练深度循环网络提供了一种无需时间反向传播的可行方案。

Abstract: Recurrent networks are typically trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.

TL;DR: 提出MDBF方法改进LLM的极低比特量化，通过多包络设计提升表达能力，同时保持二进制载波和部署友好的推理原语


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Double Binary Factorization (DBF)方法在极低比特量化中很有吸引力，但其缩放参数过于限制，所有秩分量共享相同的幅度轮廓，导致性能饱和

Method: 提出Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF)，保留共享的1比特符号基，但将单一包络替换为秩-l包络。通过共享符号矩阵，保持二进制载波，同时利用有限的内存预算提升幅度表达能力。引入闭式初始化和交替优化方法

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen系列模型上，MDBF在相同比特/权重下，相比之前的二进制格式提升了困惑度和零样本准确率

Conclusion: MDBF方法有效解决了DBF的性能饱和问题，在保持部署友好推理原语的同时，显著提升了极低比特量化的性能表现

Abstract: For extreme low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive as it enables efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy. However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.

TL;DR: HUMOR是一个用于生成幽默梗图的多模态框架，通过分层推理和群体偏好对齐来提升视觉语言模型的幽默生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成幽默梗图是一个具有挑战性的多模态任务，需要超越直接的图像到字幕监督，进行对视觉内容、上下文线索和主观幽默的细致推理。现有方法在视觉感知和幽默笑点创造之间存在差距。

Method: 提出HUMOR框架：1）采用分层多路径思维链：从模板级意图识别开始，在不同上下文下探索多样推理路径，最后锚定到高质量、上下文特定的路径；2）训练基于相同模板的梗图群体内的成对奖励模型，通过群体强化学习优化确保单调改进的理论保证。

Result: 大量实验表明，HUMOR赋予各种视觉语言模型更优的推理多样性、更可靠的偏好对齐和更高的整体梗图质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为开放式、人类对齐的多模态生成提供了一个通用训练范式，通过在连贯输出群体内进行对比判断来指导成功。

Abstract: Generating humorous memes is a challenging multimodal task that moves beyond direct image-to-caption supervision. It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CPR方法，通过因果解耦框架分离心电图的病理形态与伪影，在保持单次推理效率的同时，显著提升对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心电图深度学习模型对平滑对抗扰动(SAP)脆弱，现有防御方法存在两难：对抗训练计算成本过高，随机平滑等方法推理延迟过大，不适用于实时临床监测。作者认为脆弱性源于模型依赖非鲁棒的伪相关而非不变的病理特征。

Method: 提出因果生理表征学习(CPR)，在因果解耦框架中融入生理结构先验。通过结构因果模型建模心电图生成，执行结构干预，严格分离不变的病理形态(P-QRS-T复合波)与非因果伪影。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上，CPR显著优于标准临床预处理方法。在SAP攻击下，CPR获得0.632的F1分数，比中值平滑(0.541 F1)提升9.1%。CPR在保持单次推理效率的同时，匹配了随机平滑的认证鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CPR在鲁棒性、效率和临床可解释性之间提供了优越的权衡，为实时临床心电图监测提供了实用的对抗鲁棒性解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.

TL;DR: DLCM提出了一种分层语言建模框架，通过将计算从token转移到压缩的概念空间来提高效率，实现了在相同FLOPs下12个零样本基准测试平均提升2.69%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对所有token采用统一计算，但语言信息密度高度不均匀。这种统一计算模式浪费了可预测部分的容量，而对语义关键转换的计算分配不足。

Method: 提出动态大概念模型(DLCM)，从潜在表示中学习语义边界，将计算从token转移到压缩的概念空间。引入压缩感知缩放定律，解耦token级容量、概念级推理能力和压缩比。开发解耦μP参数化方法，支持跨宽度和压缩机制的零样本超参数迁移。

Result: 在R=4（平均4个token对应一个概念）的实用设置下，DLCM将约三分之一的推理计算重新分配到更高容量的推理骨干网络中，在匹配推理FLOPs下，12个零样本基准测试平均提升2.69%。

Conclusion: DLCM通过分层压缩改变了缩放行为，实现了更高效的计算分配。压缩感知缩放定律为固定FLOPs下的计算分配提供了原则性指导，解耦μP参数化确保了训练稳定性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) apply uniform computation to all tokens, despite language exhibiting highly non-uniform information density. This token-uniform regime wastes capacity on locally predictable spans while under-allocating computation to semantically critical transitions. We propose $\textbf{Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)}$, a hierarchical language modeling framework that learns semantic boundaries from latent representations and shifts computation from tokens to a compressed concept space where reasoning is more efficient. DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\textbf{decoupled $μ$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\textbf{+2.69$\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.

Conclusion: AutoFed通过消除手动超参数调优需求，为交通预测任务提供了一种实用的个性化联邦学习解决方案，有效解决了数据隐私和知识共享的平衡问题

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: 大规模logP预测框架：整合42.6万化合物数据，通过字节偏移索引将处理时间从100天降至3.2小时，发现分子量是最重要预测因子，树集成模型优于线性模型，分层建模策略取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决logP预测中的数据整合挑战，建立大规模预测框架，探索脂溶性多变量性质，为分子设计提供指导，证明基于描述符的集成模型仍具有竞争力。

Method: 整合PubChem、ChEMBL和eMolecules三个数据库的426850个化合物；开发字节偏移索引架构加速数据处理；系统评估线性模型和树集成模型（随机森林、XGBoost）；采用分层建模策略，分别为药物样分子（91%）和极端分子（9%）建立专门模型。

Result: 处理时间提升740倍（从100天降至3.2小时）；分子量被识别为最重要的全局预测因子；树集成模型对异方差性具有鲁棒性，测试集R²=0.765，RMSE=0.731；分层建模策略取得最佳性能：药物样分子RMSE=0.838，极端分子R²=0.767。

Conclusion: 精心策划的描述符集成模型仍能与最先进的图神经网络竞争；分子量是logP预测的关键因素；分层建模策略可优化性能；为分子设计提供实用指导，建立了仅使用2D描述符的脂溶性预测基准。

Abstract: This study presents a large-scale predictive modeling framework for logP prediction using 426850 bioactive compounds rigorously curated from the intersection of three authoritative chemical databases: PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules. We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.

TL;DR: HeteroHBA：针对异构图神经网络的生成式后门攻击框架，通过显著性筛选选择有影响力的辅助邻居节点，合成多样化的触发器特征和连接模式，使用AdaIN和MMD损失对齐特征分布以提升隐蔽性，在保持干净性能的同时实现高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构图神经网络（HGNNs）在现实应用中表现出色，但针对异构图的定向后门投毒攻击研究较少。作者关注异构节点分类任务中的后门攻击，攻击者通过在训练时注入少量触发器节点和连接，迫使特定受害节点在测试时被误分类为攻击者选择的标签，同时保持干净性能。

Method: 提出HeteroHBA生成式后门框架：1）通过显著性筛选选择有影响力的辅助邻居节点进行触发器附着；2）合成多样化的触发器特征和连接模式以更好匹配局部异质上下文；3）结合自适应实例归一化（AdaIN）和最大均值差异（MMD）损失对齐触发器特征分布与良性统计，降低可检测性；4）使用双层目标优化攻击，联合促进攻击成功并保持干净准确率。

Result: 在多个真实世界异构图和代表性HGNN架构上的实验表明，HeteroHBA始终比现有后门基线实现更高的攻击成功率，同时对干净准确率的影响相当或更小；此外，该攻击在作者提出的异质性感知结构防御CSD下仍然有效。

Conclusion: 这些结果凸显了异构图学习中实际存在的后门风险，并推动了更强防御方法的发展。HeteroHBA展示了针对异构图的隐蔽且有效的后门攻击能力，为异构图神经网络的安全性研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training among users without relying on a central server. However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.

Abstract: Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出DCL-DECOR方法，用于线性高斯系统中存在混合潜在混杂（全局+局部）时的因果发现，通过精度矩阵分解分离混杂效应，再用相关噪声DAG学习器恢复因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据中常存在混合潜在混杂：一些未观测因子广泛影响多个变量（全局混杂），另一些只影响少数变量（局部混杂）。现有方法面临挑战：可微分/基于分数的DAG学习器可能将全局潜在效应误判为因果边，而潜在变量图模型只能恢复无向结构。

Method: DCL-DECOR模块化流程：1) 通过分解观测精度矩阵为结构化分量和低秩分量，分离普遍混杂效应；2) 对去混杂后的表示应用相关噪声DAG学习器恢复有向边，同时建模剩余的结构化误差相关性；3) 简单协调步骤确保无弓形结构。

Result: 提供了混合混杂下可恢复因果目标的识别性结果，展示了整体问题如何简化为具有模块化保证的已研究子问题。合成实验表明，在变化普遍混杂强度和维度的情况下，相比直接将相关噪声DAG学习应用于混杂数据，该方法在有向边恢复方面持续改进。

Conclusion: DCL-DECOR方法有效处理混合潜在混杂的因果发现问题，通过精度引导的模块化流程分离全局和局部混杂效应，在有向因果结构恢复方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We study causal discovery from observational data in linear Gaussian systems affected by \emph{mixed latent confounding}, where some unobserved factors act broadly across many variables while others influence only small subsets. This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.
  We propose \textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.
  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.

Abstract: The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.
  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多种语言处理任务中表现出色，但计算和内存需求巨大，阻碍了在资源受限环境中的部署

Method: 采用N:M结构化剪枝和4位整数量化减少内存占用，结合优化的反量化和矩阵乘法，在CPU、GPU和自定义FPGA加速器上实现LLM推理加速

Conclusion: 细粒度N:M稀疏性和量化的结合能够实现高效可部署的LLM推理，提出的FPGA加速器为支持更广泛稀疏模式提供了灵活的架构路径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language processing tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous taxi services represent a transformative advancement in urban mobility, offering safety, efficiency, and round-the-clock operations. While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.

TL;DR: 论文证明对于具有log-sum-exp结构的损失函数，梯度下降隐式执行期望最大化算法，优化和推理是同一过程

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在标准目标训练下表现出概率推理行为（软聚类、原型专业化、贝叶斯不确定性跟踪），但现有解释依赖于混合模型的松散类比或事后架构解释，需要直接推导

Method: 证明对于任何具有log-sum-exp结构（基于距离或能量）的目标函数，每个距离的梯度恰好等于对应分量的负后验责任：∂L/∂d_j = -r_j，这是一个代数恒等式而非近似

Result: 梯度下降在此类目标上隐式执行期望最大化算法，责任不是需要计算的辅助变量而是需要应用的梯度，无需显式推理算法因为推理已嵌入优化中

Conclusion: 该结果将三种学习机制统一于单一框架：无监督混合建模（责任完全潜在）、注意力机制（责任以查询为条件）、交叉熵分类（监督将责任固定为目标），Transformer中观察到的贝叶斯结构不是涌现属性而是目标几何的必要结果

Abstract: Neural networks trained with standard objectives exhibit behaviors characteristic of probabilistic inference: soft clustering, prototype specialization, and Bayesian uncertainty tracking. These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\partial L / \partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态神经网络架构搜索提供了一种有效的自监督学习方案，解决了传统NAS方法对大量标注数据的依赖问题。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the architectural design process of deep neural networks (DNN), has attracted increasing attention. Multimodal DNNs that necessitate feature fusion from multiple modalities benefit from NAS due to their structural complexity; however, constructing an architecture for multimodal DNNs through NAS requires a substantial amount of labeled training data. Thus, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for architecture search of multimodal DNNs. The proposed method applies SSL comprehensively for both the architecture search and model pretraining processes. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method successfully designed architectures for DNNs from unlabeled training data.

Abstract: Precise probabilistic information about drug-target interaction (DTI) predictions is vital for understanding limitations and boosting predictive performance. Gaussian processes (GP) offer a scalable framework to integrate state-of-the-art DTI representations and Bayesian inference, enabling novel operations, such as Bayesian classification with rejection, top-$K$ selection, and ranking. We propose a deep kernel learning-based GP architecture (DTI-GP), which incorporates a combined neural embedding module for chemical compounds and protein targets, and a GP module. The workflow continues with sampling from the predictive distribution to estimate a Bayesian precedence matrix, which is used in fast and accurate selection and ranking operations. DTI-GP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, and it allows (1) the construction of a Bayesian accuracy-confidence enrichment score, (2) rejection schemes for improved enrichment, and (3) estimation and search for top-$K$ selections and ranking with high expected utility.

Motivation: 传统偏好建模使用Bradley-Terry模型假设传递性，忽略了人类群体偏好的复杂性。NLHF通过将非传递性偏好建模为两人零和博弈来解决此问题，但现有算法依赖正则化，在计算原始博弈的对偶间隙时会产生不可避免的偏差。

Method: 采用乐观乘性权重更新(OMWU)算法，分析其在NLHF中的收敛性。该方法不需要纳什均衡唯一性假设，能够实现最后迭代的线性收敛。

Result: 首次证明了OMWU在NLHF中的收敛性：当存在全支撑纳什均衡时，经过预热阶段后实现最后迭代线性收敛，具有实例依赖的线性收敛速率。发现了边际收敛行为，即很少被选择动作的概率从指数级小值指数增长。

Conclusion: OMWU在NLHF中具有理论优势，无需纳什均衡唯一性假设，能够收敛到原始纳什均衡，在表格和神经策略类中都表现出色，展示了在LLM应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体环境中联合状态空间呈指数增长，现有方法往往牺牲协调性，产生松散耦合或完全独立的行为，需要新的选项发现方法来促进强协调

Method: 1) 提出联合状态抽象，压缩状态空间同时保留协调所需信息；2) 近似最大对齐的虚构状态（Fermat状态），定义衡量团队错配的spreadness度量；3) 使用神经图拉普拉斯估计器推导捕获智能体间状态同步模式的选项

Result: 在多个多智能体领域场景中评估，相比其他选项发现方法，该方法产生的选项具有更强的下游协调能力

Conclusion: 通过状态同步模式捕获的联合状态抽象方法能够有效发现多智能体强协调选项，解决了现有方法协调性不足的问题

Abstract: Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.

Conclusion: AODDiff作为一种生成模型，能够灵活适应各种重建任务而无需任务特定重训练，为大气监测提供了关键的不确定性量化能力

Abstract: High-quality reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields is critical for Atmosphere monitoring, yet current models remain constrained by the scarcity of complete training data and a lack of uncertainty quantification.To address these limitations, we propose AODDiff, a probabilistic reconstruction framework based on diffusion-based Bayesian inference. By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.

Conclusion: 通过数据扰动而非模型梯度更新来量化迁移效应是更基础的表征方式，多任务学习曲线能有效捕捉迁移效应，为理解基础模型中的迁移机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transfer effects manifest themselves both during training using a fixed data set and in inductive inference using accumulating data. We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.

Conclusion: MSACL通过将Lyapunov理论与离策略actor-critic框架联系起来，为可验证的安全学习控制奠定了基础。该框架在简单奖励下实现了可证明的稳定性，为安全强化学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $λ$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Forecasting is critical in areas such as finance, biology, and healthcare. Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

Abstract: Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.
  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.
  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).

Abstract: Cognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\%. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/gnnplayground/SpectralBrainGNN to support reproducibility and future research.

### [190] [Frequent subgraph-based persistent homology for graph classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24917)
*Xinyang Chen,Amaël Broustet,Guoting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于频繁子图的图过滤方法(FSF)，生成稳定的频率持久同调特征(FPH)，并开发了FPH-ML和FPH-GNN两种图分类框架，在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图持久同调方法主要依赖度或权重等有限过滤方式，忽略了数据集中重复出现的丰富特征，限制了表达能力。需要更丰富的拓扑特征提取方法。

Method: 提出频繁子图过滤(FSF)方法，从频繁子图中推导出稳定的频率持久同调(FPH)特征。开发了两种框架：FPH-ML（基于FPH的机器学习模型）和FPH-GNN（将FPH与图神经网络集成的混合框架）。

Result: FPH-ML在准确率上与基于核和度过滤的方法相当或更优。FPH-GNN在GCN和GIN等骨干网络上实现了0.4%到21%的相对性能提升，最高提升8.2个百分点。

Conclusion: FSF方法连接了频繁子图挖掘和拓扑数据分析，为拓扑感知特征提取提供了新视角，显著提升了图分类性能，特别是在与图神经网络结合时效果更佳。

Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.

### [191] [Generative Classifiers Avoid Shortcut Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25034)
*Alexander C. Li,Ananya Kumar,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 生成式分类器通过建模所有特征（包括核心和虚假特征）而非主要关注虚假特征，能够避免判别式分类器在分布偏移下的失败问题，在图像和文本分布偏移基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 判别式分类器在分类时经常学习到只在训练分布内有效但在轻微分布偏移下就会失效的"捷径"特征，这些特征与标签存在虚假相关性。需要一种能避免过度依赖虚假特征的方法。

Method: 使用基于类条件生成模型（如扩散模型和自回归模型）的生成式分类器，建模所有特征（包括核心和虚假特征），而不是主要关注虚假特征。这种方法训练简单，不需要专门的增强、强正则化、额外超参数或对特定虚假相关性的先验知识。

Result: 在五个标准的图像和文本分布偏移基准测试中，基于扩散和自回归的生成式分类器达到了最先进的性能。在医学和卫星数据集等实际应用中，有效减少了虚假相关性的影响。通过高斯玩具设置的分析，理解了生成式分类器的归纳偏置以及决定其何时优于判别式分类器的数据特性。

Conclusion: 生成式分类器通过建模所有特征而非主要关注虚假特征，能够有效避免判别式分类器在分布偏移下的失败问题，提供了一种简单而强大的替代方案，在多种分布偏移场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.

*Cristina P. Martin-Linares,Jonathan P. Ling*

TL;DR: 提出蒸馏套娃稀疏自编码器(DMSAEs)，通过迭代蒸馏获得稳定核心特征，提升特征可解释性和可复用性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器学习的特征存在冗余且在不同训练运行和稀疏度下不一致，导致特征解释难以迁移和复用

Method: 提出DMSAEs训练流程：1)训练共享核心的Matryoshka SAE；2)使用梯度X激活度量特征对下一token损失的贡献；3)保留最小特征子集解释固定比例的归因；4)仅核心编码器权重跨周期传递，其他部分重新初始化

Result: 在Gemma-2-2B第12层残差流激活上，经过7轮蒸馏(500M tokens, 65k宽度)获得197个稳定核心特征，使用该核心训练提升了多个SAEBench指标

Conclusion: DMSAEs能够提取一致的特征核心，证明潜在特征集可以在不同稀疏度间迁移，提高了稀疏自编码器的可解释性和实用性

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels

*Gyung Hyun Je,Colin Raffel*

TL;DR: 提出使用梯度余弦相似度预测任务数据效率的方法，基于少量标注样本即可估计需要多少微调数据才能达到目标性能，避免不必要的标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在许多任务上表现出不错的零样本能力，但微调通常能进一步提升性能。然而，任务的数据效率（即达到目标性能所需的微调样本数量）通常是未知的，导致需要昂贵的增量标注和重新训练循环。

Method: 提出使用低置信度样本的梯度余弦相似度来预测数据效率。首先定义量化任务数据效率的具体指标，然后基于少量标注样本计算梯度余弦相似度作为预测器。

Result: 在30个专门任务上的实验表明，该方法在整体数据效率预测上达到8.6%的误差率，通常能为每个任务消除数百个不必要的标注。

Conclusion: 提出的梯度余弦相似度方法能够有效预测任务的数据效率，基于少量标注样本即可估计所需的微调数据量，显著减少标注成本。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task. Our experiment results and implementation code are available on GitHub.

*Haozhe Jiang,Nika Haghtalab,Lijie Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）通过并行采样和链式思维（CoT）可以模拟任何并行采样算法，实现最优时间步数。启用重掩码或修订功能可进一步优化空间复杂度，其中修订使DLMs表达能力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型作为自回归模型的替代方案，具有并行生成token的推理速度优势。本文旨在从理论上形式化这种优势，证明DLMs在并行采样中的最优性，并探索如何通过功能增强进一步优化其空间效率。

Method: 形式化并行采样模型，证明DLMs结合多项式长度链式思维（CoT）可以模拟任何并行采样算法，使用最优数量的顺序步骤。进一步证明启用重掩码（将未掩码token转为掩码）或修订（将未掩码token转为其他未掩码token）功能，结合CoT可使DLMs以最优空间复杂度模拟并行采样算法。

Result: DLMs结合CoT可以实现最优时间步数的并行采样。启用重掩码或修订功能可达到最优空间复杂度。建立了严格的表达能力差距：具有修订或重掩码功能的DLMs比没有这些功能的DLMs表达能力更强。

Conclusion: 研究结果为DLMs作为最高效并行采样器的承诺提供了理论依据，并主张在DLMs中启用修订功能，这不仅能实现最优时间步数，还能优化空间复杂度并增强表达能力。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.

### [195] [ResponseRank: Data-Efficient Reward Modeling through Preference Strength Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25023)
*Timo Kaufmann,Yannick Metz,Daniel Keim,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ResponseRank方法，利用相对差异的代理信号（如响应时间、标注者一致性）来推断偏好强度，通过局部分层比较控制系统性变异，提高样本效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的二元选择（如RLHF）只能传达偏好方向，无法衡量偏好强度。强度信息对于不确定性决策和偏好模型泛化至关重要，但难以可靠测量。现有代理信号（响应时间、标注者一致性）通常噪声大且存在混淆因素。

Method: 提出ResponseRank方法：1）利用代理信号的相对差异对成对比较中的响应进行偏好强度排序；2）通过精心构建的分层进行局部比较，控制系统性变异；3）在最小化对强度信号假设的前提下，学习与强度排序一致的效用差异。

Result: 在三个任务上验证：1）合成偏好学习（模拟响应时间）；2）语言建模（标注者一致性）；3）RL控制任务（模拟回合回报）。结果显示改进的样本效率和鲁棒性。同时提出PDC指标来分离基数效用学习和序数准确性。

Conclusion: ResponseRank能够从噪声强度信号中稳健学习偏好强度，通过局部相对比较方法有效利用代理信号，为偏好学习提供了更丰富的强度信息，提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.

Motivation: 挑战先前关于不同注意力架构（均匀注意力与可学习注意力）会产生不同模块化加法电路的观点，揭示这些架构实际上实现相同算法的本质。

Method: 超越单个神经元和权重的解释，识别所有对应每个学习表示的神经元，将神经元群体作为一个整体实体研究，利用拓扑学工具分析学习表示作为流形的特性。

Result: 通过统计分析数百个电路的学习表示，证明从常见深度学习范式中自然产生的学习模块化加法电路具有相似性，Clock和Pizza架构实现了拓扑和几何等价的表示。

Conclusion: 不同注意力架构（均匀注意力与可学习注意力）实际上实现了相同的模块化加法算法，具有等价的表示，这挑战了先前关于架构设计导致不同电路的观点。

Abstract: The Clock and Pizza interpretations, associated with architectures differing in either uniform or learnable attention, were introduced to argue that different architectural designs can yield distinct circuits for modular addition. In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.

TL;DR: 提出B-Trans方法，将标准LLM转换为贝叶斯Transformer，通过归一化层中的偏置偏移作为随机变量，从单一预训练权重中采样多样化的模型实例，实现群体智能决策。


<details>

Motivation: 现代Transformer通常训练为单一确定性系统，但智能可能源于多个思维的集合。受此启发，希望从单一预训练权重中采样出多样化但连贯的模型实例，实现群体决策优势。

Method: 将归一化层中的偏置偏移视为随机变量，采用高斯变分近似构建贝叶斯后验代理。在序列级别冻结采样噪声以保证时间一致性，从单一权重中采样多样化模型实例。

Result: 在零样本生成、RLVR和无标签RL等任务中，B-Trans通过聚合多个采样个体的预测，显著提升了语义多样性，同时获得了比确定性基线更好的任务性能。

Conclusion: B-Trans成功将标准LLM转换为贝叶斯Transformer，实现了从单一权重中采样多样化模型实例，验证了群体决策在提升语义多样性和任务性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.
  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.

Abstract: High-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.

Motivation: 现有文本驱动的3D人体运动编辑方法虽然取得了显著进展，但由于其全局建模特性，难以精确控制详细、部件特定的运动。需要一种能够进行细粒度、部件级控制的运动编辑方法。

Method: 1. Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM)模块：基于预定义的五部分身体分解，动态预测每个身体部件的时间变化调制权重，实现精确可解释的局部运动编辑。2. 部件级相似度曲线监督机制：采用双层归一化增强，帮助PMM学习语义一致且可编辑的身体部件分布。3. Bidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI)模块：利用双向跨模态注意力实现文本指令与运动语义的更准确对齐。

Conclusion: PartMotionEdit通过部件级语义调制实现了细粒度的3D人体运动编辑，解决了现有方法在局部运动控制方面的局限性，为精确的运动编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing text-driven 3D human motion editing methods have demonstrated significant progress, but are still difficult to precisely control over detailed, part-specific motions due to their global modeling nature. In this paper, we propose PartMotionEdit, a novel fine-grained motion editing framework that operates via part-level semantic modulation. The core of PartMotionEdit is a Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM) module, which builds upon a predefined five-part body decomposition. PMM dynamically predicts time-varying modulation weights for each body part, enabling precise and interpretable editing of local motions. To guide the training of PMM, we also introduce a part-level similarity curve supervision mechanism enhanced with dual-layer normalization. This mechanism assists PMM in learning semantically consistent and editable distributions across all body parts. Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI) module. It leverages bidirectional cross-modal attention to achieve more accurate semantic alignment between textual instructions and motion semantics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a well-known benchmark demonstrate that PartMotionEdit outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有牙齿点云分割方法主要采用语义分割，关注不同类型牙齿间的语义特征。但由于牙齿结构紧密、边界不清，以及缺牙、错位牙等复杂病例的多样性，语义分割在处理复杂牙科病例时往往难以获得满意结果。

Conclusion: BATISNet通过边界感知实例分割方法，在复杂牙科病例中实现了更鲁棒准确的牙齿点云分割，解决了传统语义分割在处理紧密牙齿结构、边界不清和复杂病例时的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the tooth point cloud is of great significance for diagnosis clinical assisting and treatment planning. Existing methods mostly employ semantic segmentation, focusing on the semantic feature between different types of teeth. However, due to the tightly packed structure of teeth, unclear boundaries, and the diversity of complex cases such as missing teeth, malposed teeth, semantic segmentation often struggles to achieve satisfactory results when dealing with complex dental cases. To address these issues, this paper propose BATISNet, a boundary-aware instance network for tooth point cloud segmentation. This network model consists of a feature extraction backbone and an instance segmentation module. It not only focuses on extracting the semantic features of different types of teeth but also learns the instance features of individual teeth. It helps achieve more robust and accurate tooth instance segmentation in complex clinical scenarios such as missing teeth and malposed teeth. Additionally, to further enhance the completeness and accuracy of tooth boundary segmentation, a boundary-aware loss function is designed to specifically supervise the boundary segmentation between instances. It mitigates effectively tooth adhesion and boundary ambiguity issues. Extensive experimental results show that BATISNet outperforms existing methods in tooth integrity segmentation, providing more reliable and detailed data support for practical clinical applications.

Result: 实现了首个将3DGS直接与物理模拟器耦合的框架，支持碰撞感知、基于物理的任意多材料物体操作，无需训练且计算轻量

Conclusion: PhysTalk使4D动画制作更加普及，将工作流程从"渲染等待"范式转变为与现代化物理感知管道的交互式对话

Abstract: Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a "render and wait" paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.

Motivation: 当前语言模型评估（如MMLU、TruthfulQA）只测量理想条件下的知识，无法评估模型在现实压力下的稳健性。无法区分缺乏知识的模型与验证机制在信息退化或对抗性攻击下崩溃的模型。

Method: 提出Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT)协议，测量认知稳健性。采用两系统认知模型：语义系统生成流畅文本，认知验证器验证事实准确性。评估9个前沿模型在8个知识领域和5个压缩级别（共1800次轮级评估）。

Result: 认知稳健性与传统设计范式正交：参数数量(r=0.083)和架构类型(r=0.153)均不显著预测稳健性。错误检测能力强烈预测整体稳健性(rho=-0.817, p=0.007)。旗舰模型表现出脆弱性，而小型模型可实现稳健性能。

Conclusion: DDFT框架为评估认知稳健性提供理论基础和实用工具。模型稳健性源于训练方法和验证机制，而非规模大小，这对关键应用部署前的评估至关重要。

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

TL;DR: CASCADE是一个自我进化的LLM智能体框架，通过持续学习和自我反思掌握复杂工具，在材料科学和化学任务上达到93.3%成功率，实现从"LLM+工具使用"到"LLM+技能获取"的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体依赖预定义工具或脆弱的工具生成，限制了其在复杂科学任务中的能力和适应性。需要从简单的工具使用转向真正的技能获取。

Method: CASCADE框架通过两种元技能实现自我进化：1) 持续学习（通过网页搜索和代码提取）；2) 自我反思（通过内省和知识图谱探索）。框架还包括人机协作和记忆整合机制。

Result: 在包含116个材料科学和化学研究任务的SciSkillBench基准测试中，使用GPT-5的CASCADE达到93.3%成功率，相比没有进化机制的35.4%有显著提升。展示了在计算分析、自主实验室实验和论文选择性复现等实际应用。

Conclusion: CASCADE能够积累可执行的技能，这些技能可以在智能体和科学家之间共享，为实现可扩展的AI辅助科学研究迈出了重要一步，代表了从"LLM+工具使用"到"LLM+技能获取"的范式转变。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

TL;DR: SPARK是一个基于多智能体LLM的个性化搜索框架，通过角色化智能体协作实现动态查询理解和个性化检索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化搜索系统受限于静态用户画像和单一检索流程，难以捕捉用户动态、多维的信息需求。需要一种能够模拟人类信息寻求行为的复杂性和情境敏感性的新方法。

Method: SPARK框架定义了包含角色、专业领域、任务上下文和领域的角色空间，通过角色协调器动态解释查询并激活相关专业智能体。每个智能体执行独立的检索增强生成过程，配备长短期记忆存储和情境感知推理模块。智能体间通过共享内存库、迭代辩论和中继式知识转移等结构化通信协议进行协作。

Result: 该框架从分布式智能体行为中产生涌现的个性化特性，提供了关于协调效率、个性化质量和认知负载分布的可测试预测，同时包含自适应学习机制用于持续角色优化。

Conclusion: SPARK通过细粒度智能体专业化与协作检索的结合，为下一代搜索系统提供了洞察，使其能够捕捉人类信息寻求行为的复杂性、流动性和情境敏感性。

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

TL;DR: ROAD是一种无需标注数据集、通过自动化调试进行提示优化的框架，利用多智能体架构将失败日志转化为决策树协议，在冷启动场景下显著提升LLM代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法依赖大量标注数据集，但在实际软件工程中，代理开发初期只有混乱的生产日志和不断演变的失败模式，缺乏精炼数据集。

Method: ROAD采用多智能体架构：分析器进行根因分析，优化器进行模式聚合，教练进行策略整合，将非结构化失败日志转化为结构化决策树协议，将优化视为动态调试而非随机搜索。

Result: 在学术基准和实际生产知识管理引擎中，ROAD仅通过三次自动化迭代就使成功率提升5.6%（73.6%到79.2%），搜索准确率提升3.8%。在零售领域复杂推理任务中，相对基线提升约19%。

Conclusion: 模仿人类工程循环（失败分析和修复）为部署可靠LLM代理提供了一种可行且数据高效的方法，是资源密集型强化学习训练的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on large, labeled gold-standard development sets to compute fitness scores for evolutionary or Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LoongFlow是一个自进化智能体框架，通过将LLM集成到"计划-执行-总结"认知范式中，显著提升进化算法在代码空间中的探索效率，减少计算成本的同时获得更优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化方法在从静态LLM向自改进智能体过渡时存在结构化推理不足的问题，现有方法在高维代码空间中容易过早收敛且探索效率低下。

Method: 提出LoongFlow框架：1) 集成LLM到"计划-执行-总结"认知范式，将进化搜索映射为推理密集型过程；2) 采用混合进化记忆系统，结合多岛模型、MAP-Elites和自适应玻尔兹曼选择，平衡探索与利用；3) 实例化为通用智能体（算法发现）和ML智能体（管道优化）。

Result: 在AlphaEvolve基准测试和Kaggle竞赛中，LoongFlow比OpenEvolve、ShinkaEvolve等基线方法进化效率提升高达60%，同时发现更优解决方案。

Conclusion: LoongFlow在自主科学发现领域迈出重要一步，能够以更低计算开销生成专家级解决方案，标志着从静态LLM向自进化智能体的实质性进展。

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogRec是一个结合大语言模型和Soar认知架构的推荐系统，利用LLM初始化知识，通过Soar进行符号推理，在遇到障碍时动态查询LLM生成新规则，实现可解释的在线学习推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推荐系统中存在"黑盒"特性、知识幻觉和有限在线学习能力等问题，影响可信度和适应性；而认知架构如Soar虽然推理过程结构化可解释，但知识获取困难。需要结合两者优势解决互补挑战。

Method: 提出CogRec认知推荐代理，以Soar作为核心符号推理引擎，利用LLM进行知识初始化填充工作记忆中的产生式规则。采用感知-认知-行动(PCA)循环，遇到障碍时动态查询LLM获取推理解决方案，通过Soar的分块机制转化为新的符号产生式规则。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的广泛评估表明，CogRec在推荐准确性、可解释性以及解决长尾问题方面表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: CogRec成功结合了LLM和Soar认知架构的优势，实现了可解释的在线学习推荐系统，解决了传统LLM推荐中的黑盒、知识幻觉和有限学习能力问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、基于图结构的交互推理方法，在ARC-AGI-3基准测试中显著优于当前最先进的LLM，通过系统化的状态空间探索和视觉处理解决游戏式任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的LLM在ARC-AGI-3基准测试中无法可靠解决交互推理任务，该基准包含需要推断任务机制、形成假设并进行测试的游戏式任务，因此需要开发新的方法来应对这种挑战。

Method: 结合视觉帧处理和系统化状态空间探索的图结构方法：1) 将视觉帧分割为有意义的组件；2) 基于视觉显著性对动作进行优先级排序；3) 维护探索状态和转移的有向图；4) 跟踪已访问状态和测试过的动作，优先选择能提供最短路径到未测试状态-动作对的动作。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-3预览挑战中，该方法在6个游戏的52个关卡中解决了中位数30关，在私有排行榜上排名第3，显著优于前沿的LLM智能体。

Conclusion: 即使无需学习，显式的图结构探索也能作为交互推理的强大基线，突显了在稀疏反馈环境中系统化状态跟踪和动作优先级排序的重要性，而当前LLM在这些环境中无法捕捉任务动态。

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/arc-agi-3-just-explore.

Abstract: We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility. By standardizing scientific context and tool orchestration at the protocol level, SCP establishes essential infrastructure for scalable, multi-institution, agent-driven science.

Motivation: FSMVRP在实际应用中非常重要（如短期车辆租赁和按需物流），但需要同时做出车队组成和路径规划决策，这增加了问题的复杂性，特别是在大规模和时间受限的环境中，传统方法面临显著挑战。

Method: 将FSMVRP建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），开发了一种名为FRIPN的新型策略网络，无缝集成车队组成和路径规划决策。该方法包含专门为不同决策目标设计的输入嵌入，包括剩余图嵌入以促进有效的车辆使用决策。

Conclusion: 该方法具有实际应用的潜力，并为将基于DRL的技术扩展到VRP的其他变体提供了有价值的启发。

Abstract: The Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) is a prominent variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), extensively studied in operations research and computational science. FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios. These strengths highlight the potential of our approach for practical applications and provide valuable inspiration for extending DRL-based techniques to other variants of VRP.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA)方法，通过嵌套风险度量在策略优化中显式纳入风险意识，解决传统安全对齐方法风险中性不足的问题，有效抑制低概率高危害行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法（如Safe RLHF、SACPO）通常采用风险中性范式，无法充分处理参考策略偏差带来的风险，对罕见但可能灾难性的有害行为鲁棒性有限。

Method: RSA将安全对齐构建为token级别的风险感知约束策略优化问题，通过逐步对齐过程解决，利用嵌套风险度量推导token级别的策略更新，抑制模型偏离参考策略和低概率高危害行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持高帮助性的同时确保强安全性，显著抑制了尾部风险（低概率但高影响的不安全响应）。

Conclusion: RSA通过显式纳入风险意识，解决了传统安全对齐方法的局限性，为语言模型安全对齐提供了更稳健的方法，能够有效控制尾部风险。

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

Motivation: 在部分可观测环境下，LLM智能体需要有效推断潜在世界状态，但现有方法依赖梯度更新或额外训练，计算开销大且不够灵活。

Method: 维护外部结构化环境状态信念，通过动作条件观察迭代更新，使用轻量级LLM代理估计信息增益，通过最大化信念空间信息增益选择动作，采用量化后验信念与真实环境配置一致性的新型奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在潜在世界状态对齐方面优于推理时扩展基线（如提示增强或检索增强的LLM），且集成开销显著降低。

Conclusion: 提出的测试时自适应方法通过后验引导的信念精化，为部分可观测环境下的LLM智能体提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的探索推理框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a test-time adaptive agent that performs exploratory inference through posterior-guided belief refinement without relying on gradient-based updates or additional training for LLM agent operating under partial observability. Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain using a lightweight LLM-based surrogate and assess world alignment through a novel reward that quantifies the consistency between posterior belief and ground-truth environment configuration. Experiments show that our method outperforms inference-time scaling baselines such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.

Conclusion: 通过系统研究JEPA-WM系列方法的关键技术选择，提出了优化的解决方案，为在表示空间进行高效规划的世界模型提供了重要见解和实践指导。

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出交互式评估框架，分析基础模型智能体在符号地图环境中的探索、记忆和推理能力，揭示探索策略、记忆表示和推理方案对空间理解的不同作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型空间能力评估多依赖静态地图输入或文本查询，忽视了空间理解的交互性和经验驱动特性，需要更全面的评估框架来理解智能体在动态地图环境中的表现。

Method: 设计交互式评估框架，让智能体在部分可观察的网格地图中增量探索（包含道路、交叉口和兴趣点），仅接收局部观察，然后通过六类空间任务评估空间理解能力，系统变化探索策略、记忆表示和推理方案。

Result: 探索主要影响经验获取但对最终推理准确率影响有限；记忆表示在整合空间经验中起核心作用，结构化记忆（特别是序列和图表示）显著提升路径规划等结构密集型任务性能；推理方案影响存储空间知识的利用方式，高级提示支持更有效的多步推理；空间推理性能在模型版本和规模达到一定阈值后饱和。

Conclusion: 提升地图空间理解需要针对空间表示和推理的专门机制，而非单纯模型缩放；结构化记忆表示和高级推理方案对空间任务性能至关重要，为开发可靠的地图推理应用提供指导。

Abstract: Map environments provide a fundamental medium for representing spatial structure. Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究评估了三种主流LLM在数学竞赛问题上的表现，发现DeepSeek-V3在所有类别中表现最佳，但所有模型在几何问题上都表现薄弱，揭示了不同模型特有的错误模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多使用相同的数据集评估LLM的数学推理能力，限制了结果的普适性，未能充分捕捉数学任务中的多样性挑战。本研究旨在通过分析LLM在代表性不足的数学竞赛问题上的表现，获得更深入的见解。

Method: 使用密苏里大学数学竞赛问题（涵盖微积分、解析几何和离散数学）测试三种主流LLM（GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.0-Flash、DeepSeek-V3），比较其回答与正确答案的匹配度，并分析推理过程中的错误模式。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在微积分、解析几何和离散数学三个类别中表现最佳（推理和最终答案都最好）。所有三种LLM在几何问题上表现明显薄弱。DeepSeek-V3的主要错误是计算和逻辑错误，GPT-4o-mini常见逻辑和方法错误，Gemini则倾向于不完整推理和仓促结论。

Conclusion: 在代表性不足的数学竞赛数据集上评估LLM能够提供对其独特错误模式的深入见解，并突显结构化推理（特别是几何领域）中的持续挑战。

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在通用语言能力上表现出色，但在结构化环境中的空间变换和多步规划方面仍然存在困难，这限制了其在导航和规划等应用中的效果。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）监督微调学习基础空间变换（旋转、平移、缩放）；2）冻结物理感知模型，在GRPO框架下训练轻量级LoRA适配器，学习组合这些基础模块进行多步规划。构建ASCII艺术数据集和相应强化学习环境支持该方法。

Result: 方法在动态环境（显式状态更新）和静态环境（依赖内部状态）中均优于基线模型，包括通用骨干模型、物理感知模型和端到端RL模型。训练收敛更快、更稳定，注意力模式分析显示微调确实改善了空间理解能力。

Conclusion: 将空间推理分解为基础构建块及其组合的两阶段方法能有效提升LLM的空间推理能力，为导航和规划应用提供了更可靠的解决方案，且训练更高效稳定。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Result: 实验显示不同主流大语言模型在处理复杂多步工具调用时存在显著性能差异

Conclusion: MCPAgentBench为评估LLM代理工具使用能力提供了有效基准，代码已开源，有助于推动自主代理发展

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend. Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations. All code is open-source at Github.

Method: 提出递归语言模型（RLMs），将长提示视为外部环境，让LLM以编程方式检查、分解并递归调用自身处理提示片段

Result: RLMs能处理比模型上下文窗口长两个数量级的输入，在四个不同的长上下文任务中显著优于基础LLMs和常见长上下文框架，且查询成本相当或更低

Conclusion: RLMs是一种有效的推理策略，能够显著扩展LLMs处理长提示的能力，在保持成本效益的同时提升性能

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: This paper proposes a group deliberation oriented multi-agent conversational model to address the limitations of single large language models in complex reasoning tasks. The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

Conclusion: GenZ成功桥接了基础模型和统计建模，通过可解释的语义特征发现数据集特定模式，在保持基础模型语义理解的同时显著提升了预测性能，揭示了传统方法难以发现的领域特定洞察。

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

Result: ROME在超过100万条轨迹上训练，在SWE-bench Verified和Terminal Bench等基准测试中表现出色，证明了ALE基础设施的有效性。还引入了Terminal Bench Pro基准，具有改进的规模和污染控制。

Conclusion: ALE为智能体LLM开发提供了系统化的基础设施，ROME的成功验证了该方法的有效性，为开源社区提供了端到端的智能体学习解决方案。

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

Conclusion: 该解决方案通过加速标准化格式的大型标注数据集准备，直接支持DARTS项目，加强了波兰自动驾驶研究的技术基础

Abstract: This report presents the design and implementation of a semi-automated data annotation pipeline developed within the DARTS project, whose goal is to create a large-scale, multimodal dataset of driving scenarios recorded in Polish conditions. Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.

TL;DR: 迭代部署LLM并通过用户数据筛选进行微调，可显著改变模型特性，实现类似强化学习的效果，但存在安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究迭代部署大型语言模型时，通过用户从先前模型部署中精心筛选数据进行微调，如何影响最终模型的特性变化。

Method: 在不同规划领域测试迭代部署机制：每个新模型基于用户从前一模型部署中筛选的数据进行微调，观察模型规划能力的变化。

Result: 后续模型展现出显著的规划能力提升，具有涌现的泛化能力，能发现比初始模型长得多的规划方案。理论分析表明迭代部署实现了类似强化学习的外循环训练。

Conclusion: 迭代部署机制可视为显式强化学习的替代训练方案，但存在AI安全风险，因为隐含的奖励函数未明确定义，可能对未来模型部署产生意外影响。

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

TL;DR: STAgent是一个专门用于时空理解的智能体大语言模型，通过工具交互解决复杂时空任务，同时保持通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决复杂的时空任务（如受限兴趣点发现和行程规划），需要开发一个能够与多种时空工具交互、在推理过程中探索、验证和优化中间步骤的智能体模型。

Method: 提出了三个关键贡献：1）支持10+领域特定工具的稳定工具环境；2）分层数据筛选框架（筛选比1:10,000）；3）级联训练方法（种子SFT→高确定性SFT→低确定性RL）。基于Qwen3-30B-A3B初始化。

Result: STAgent在TravelBench上表现出色，同时在广泛的通用基准测试中保持了通用能力，验证了所提智能体模型的有效性。

Conclusion: STAgent通过专门的时空理解能力和工具交互机制，成功解决了复杂时空任务，同时保持了模型的通用性，为智能体大语言模型在时空领域的应用提供了有效方案。

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.

Abstract: This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.
