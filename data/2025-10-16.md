### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，通过扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，并添加LiDAR支持，解决了现有神经渲染方法在自动驾驶测试中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）渲染速度慢或仅支持针孔相机模型，无法满足自动驾驶测试中对高畸变镜头和LiDAR数据的需求，且多传感器仿真存在跨传感器不一致性问题。

Method: 扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于光线的剔除，设计了分解的3D高斯表示和锚定策略来解决跨传感器不一致性。

Result: 相比现有方法，相机和深度误差降低了40%，渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍，在两个自动驾驶数据集上达到或超过最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，在渲染速度和跨传感器一致性方面显著优于现有技术，为自动驾驶系统的高保真仿真提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgFUTR：通过状态变化学习重新定义手术未来预测，使用师生架构和动作动态模块，在五个预测任务上实现跨数据集和手术程序的持续改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解正在发生的事件，而非预测未来事件。现有方法针对孤立任务，缺乏统一方法，且基于未来特征预测的方法难以在不同手术情境和程序中泛化。

Method: 将手术未来预测重构为状态变化学习，通过师生架构实现。使用Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类将视频片段压缩为状态表示，教师网络学习当前和未来片段，学生网络仅从当前视频预测未来状态，由动作动态模块引导。

Result: 在四个数据集和三个手术程序上的实验显示持续改进。跨程序迁移验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过状态变化学习的方法在手术未来预测任务上表现优异，具有跨手术程序的泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TMPS框架，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样，使用少量目标域样本显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在训练环境外图像上表现不佳，主要由于疾病症状的细微变化和领域差异，训练数据多样性不足导致模型泛化能力弱。

Method: TMPS框架基于度量学习，假设可获得少量目标域标记样本，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样策略有效利用这些样本提升诊断鲁棒性。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上测试，仅使用每疾病10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线模型在宏F1分数上分别提升7.3和3.6个百分点，相比传统度量学习提升17.1-18.7个百分点。

Conclusion: TMPS框架通过有效利用少量目标域样本，显著提高了植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

### [4] [Foveation Improves Payload Capacity in Steganography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13151)
*Lifeng Qiu Lin,Henry Kam,Qi Sun,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于高效潜在表示和注视点渲染的隐写术方法，将容量限制从100比特提升到500比特，同时实现更好的准确性（2000比特中仅有1比特错误），并保持了31.47 dB PSNR和0.13 LPIPS的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐写术在视觉媒体中用于提供元数据和水印，但现有方法在容量和准确性方面存在限制，需要改进。

Method: 利用高效的潜在表示和注视点渲染训练模型，通过新颖的感知设计创建多模态潜在表示。

Result: 将容量限制从100比特提升到500比特，在200K测试比特中实现仅1比特错误的准确性，视觉质量达到31.47 dB PSNR和0.13 LPIPS。

Conclusion: 新颖的感知设计在创建隐写术中的多模态潜在表示方面表现出有效性，显著提升了容量和准确性，同时保持了良好的视觉质量。

Abstract: Steganography finds its use in visual medium such as providing metadata and
watermarking. With support of efficient latent representations and foveated
rendering, we trained models that improve existing capacity limits from 100 to
500 bits, while achieving better accuracy of up to 1 failure bit out of 2000,
at 200K test bits. Finally, we achieve a comparable visual quality of 31.47 dB
PSNR and 0.13 LPIPS, showing the effectiveness of novel perceptual design in
creating multi-modal latent representations in steganography.

### [5] [Unifying Vision-Language Latents for Zero-label Image Caption Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12931)
*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个无需标签的视觉语言对齐增强框架，通过在训练中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，使现有视觉语言模型无需文本标签或完全重新训练即可生成改进的图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型依赖标注图像数据集，限制了可扩展性并导致大量未标注图像数据未被充分利用。

Method: 提出统一视觉语言对齐的零标签增强框架，在训练过程中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，无需依赖人工或合成标注数据集。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上的应用显示，ViZer在定性评估中产生更贴近实际、更具描述性的图像描述，尽管自动评估指标如CIDEr和BERTScore可能惩罚参考描述中缺失的细节。

Conclusion: ViZer为视觉语言任务中的零标签适应提供了实用起点，能够有效提升现有模型的描述生成质量而无需额外标注数据。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

### [6] [Automated document processing system for government agencies using DBNET++ and BART models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13303)
*Aya Kaysan Bahjat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动文档分类系统，能够检测图像中的文本内容并将文档分为四类（发票、报告、信件、表格），支持离线图像和实时摄像头捕获，在具有挑战性的成像条件下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中文档分类面临的挑战，包括光照变化、任意方向、弯曲或部分遮挡文本、低分辨率和远距离文本等问题。

Method: 采用四阶段流水线：图像捕获与预处理、使用DBNet++进行文本检测、使用BART分类器进行文本分类，所有模块集成在基于Python和PyQt5的用户界面中。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上经过10小时测试，文本检测准确率达到92.88%，该系统在无约束成像场景下对混合来源文档分类有效。

Conclusion: 该方法在具有挑战性的实际文档分类场景中表现出有效性，能够处理各种复杂成像条件。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

*Xiao He,Huangxuan Zhao,Guojia Wan,Wei Zhou,Yanxing Liu,Juhua Liu,Yongchao Xu,Yong Luo,Dacheng Tao,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个专门针对胎儿超声的医学AI系统，通过引入显著认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的双分图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导临床步骤选择，在胎儿超声报告生成和诊断任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，面临多视图推理、疾病多样性和图像异质性等挑战。

Method: 提出显著认知解耦(SED)方法，注入专家构建的双分图来解耦视图-疾病关联，通过强化学习引导临床步骤选择，并构建了首个大规模胎儿超声报告数据集FetalSigma-1M。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线模型，平均增益+14%，在关键疾病上的准确率提高61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过临床工作流引导的SED方法有效解决了胎儿超声领域的挑战，为医学AI在胎儿超声诊断中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [8] [Leveraging 2D Priors and SDF Guidance for Dynamic Urban Scene Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13381)
*Siddharth Tourani,Jayaram Reddy,Akash Kumbar,Satyajit Tourani,Nishant Goyal,Madhava Krishna,N. Dinesh Reddy,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将符号距离函数与3D高斯泼溅相结合的新方法，用于动态场景渲染和重建，无需LiDAR数据和3D运动标注即可实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于3D高斯泼溅的方法需要相机和LiDAR数据、真实3D分割和运动数据，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在探索如何通过2D对象无关先验来放宽这些要求。

Method: 将符号距离函数与3D高斯泼溅集成，利用深度和点跟踪的2D先验，构建统一的优化框架来增强几何精度和变形建模。

Result: 在城市场景中无需LiDAR数据即可达到最先进的渲染指标，结合LiDAR时能进一步改进重建和生成新视图的能力，支持场景分解和组合等编辑任务。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合SDF和3DGS的优势，实现了更鲁棒的对象表示，放宽了对LiDAR和3D运动标注的依赖，在动态场景渲染和重建中表现出色。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

### [9] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级指导堆栈，通过ZeResFDG模块统一频率解耦指导、能量重缩放和零投影技术，结合轻量级频谱EMA在采样过程中切换保守和细节寻求模式，提升图像清晰度、提示符遵循度和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决SD/SDXL模型在采样过程中存在的图像模糊、提示符遵循度不足和伪影问题，需要开发一种无需重新训练就能提升图像质量的采样器级指导方法。

Method: 核心模块ZeResFDG结合三种技术：(1)频率解耦指导，对指导信号的低频和高频分量重新加权；(2)能量重缩放，匹配每个样本的指导预测幅度与正分支；(3)零投影，移除与无条件方向平行的分量。同时使用轻量级频谱EMA在采样过程中动态切换模式。

Result: 在SD/SDXL采样器中，ZeResFDG在中等指导尺度下显著改善了图像清晰度、提示符遵循度和伪影控制，无需任何重新训练。QSilk微颗粒稳定器进一步提升了鲁棒性并生成了自然的高频微纹理。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5提供了一种有效的采样器级指导方法，能够显著提升SD/SDXL模型的图像质量，同时保持训练无关性和计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

TL;DR: SCOPE是一种混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由动态选择专用编码器，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视觉编码器的VLMs存在计算成本高且收益递减的问题，需要更智能的编码器选择方法。

Method: 使用共享编码器和路由编码器池，通过轻量级路由器基于文本提示和共享视觉特征的交叉注意力选择最优编码器，采用双熵正则化训练路由器。

Result: 仅使用1个共享+1个路由编码器的SCOPE优于同时使用4个额外编码器的模型，计算量减少24-49%。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合，挑战了多编码器VLMs的现有范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了时空视频动作定位(SVAG)新任务，需要同时检测、跟踪和时间定位视频中基于自然语言动作描述的所有参考对象。构建了大规模基准SVAG-Bench，并提出基线框架SVAGFormer和评估工具SVAGEval。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决粗粒度动作识别或通用目标跟踪，忽视了根据动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并进行时间定位的挑战。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配最先进的视觉语言模型进行联合空间和时间定位，并开发SVAGEval标准化评估工具包。

Result: 实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，特别是在密集或复杂场景中，突显了在长视频中对细粒度对象-动作交互进行更高级推理的需求。

Conclusion: SVAG任务提出了新的挑战，需要开发能够处理细粒度对象-动作交互和复杂场景推理的先进模型。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

TL;DR: 提出了SeqBench基准测试，用于评估文本到视频生成中的序列叙事连贯性，包含320个提示和2560个人工标注视频，并设计了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型在创建视觉吸引力视频方面取得进展，但在生成需要逻辑进展的连贯序列叙事方面存在困难，现有基准主要关注视觉质量指标而无法评估扩展序列的叙事连贯性。

Method: 设计了SeqBench基准测试，包含精心设计的320个提示数据集，涵盖各种叙事复杂度，使用8个最先进的T2V模型生成了2560个人工标注视频，并开发了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标来高效捕捉长程依赖和时间顺序。

Result: 基于DTG的指标与人类标注显示出强相关性，系统评估揭示了当前T2V模型的关键局限性：在多动作序列中无法保持一致的物体状态、在多物体场景中产生物理上不合理的结果、难以保持连续动作之间的现实时序和顺序关系。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估T2V生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，并为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

TL;DR: SceneAdapt框架通过两个适应阶段（中间帧生成和场景感知中间帧生成）将场景感知注入文本条件运动模型，利用不相交的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法单独处理运动语义或场景感知，构建同时具有丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集极具挑战性。

Method: 使用运动中间帧生成作为代理任务桥接两个不同数据集。第一阶段引入关键帧层调制运动潜在空间，第二阶段添加场景条件层通过交叉注意力自适应查询局部上下文。

Result: 实验结果显示SceneAdapt有效将场景感知注入文本到运动模型，并分析了这种感知出现的机制。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt框架成功解决了同时处理运动语义和场景感知的挑战，代码和模型将发布。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

*Huawei Jiang,Husna Mutahira,Gan Huang,Mannan Saeed Muhammad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间模型的混合框架（1D-CNN-ECG-Mamba），用于从心电图中准确检测心脏异常，在PhysioNet挑战赛数据集上取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [15] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是第一个无需几何先验就能实现真正新视角合成的自监督模型，通过成对位姿估计和输入输出增强方案，实现了相机位姿与场景内容的解耦，并能将学习到的位姿表示在不同场景间迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新视角合成方法预测的位姿缺乏可迁移性——同一组位姿在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，无法实现真正的新视角合成。

Method: 结合成对位姿估计与输入输出增强方案，无需3D归纳偏置或多视角几何概念，使用无约束的潜在位姿变量实现相机位姿与场景内容的解耦。

Result: XFactor显著优于先前的无位姿新视角合成变换器，通过探测实验证明潜在位姿与现实世界位姿高度相关，并引入了量化可迁移性的新指标。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式3D几何表示也能实现真正的新视角合成，为自监督视觉表示学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方向感知的多尺度梯度损失函数，用于红外与可见光图像融合，通过分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量并保留其符号，提升边缘清晰度和纹理保留效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在训练时使用梯度幅值损失，但幅值计算会丢失方向信息，导致监督模糊和边缘保真度不足。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在多尺度上保留其符号，不改变模型架构或训练协议。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公共基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能有效提升边缘清晰度、对齐度和纹理保留效果。

Conclusion: 方向感知的多尺度梯度损失为图像融合提供了清晰的方向指导，显著改善了融合质量。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督域自适应框架，通过结合z-归一化风格协调和双向可变形图像配准来解决医学图像分割中的域偏移问题，特别关注内容变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同数据集间部署时因域偏移（风格和内容变化）而性能下降，特别是在从健康人群转移到临床痴呆患者时。

Method: 结合z-归一化进行风格协调，使用双向可变形图像配准（DIR）网络与分割和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换以对齐源图像到目标域。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个MRI海马体数据集上均优于现有基线方法，从健康人群转移到痴呆患者时Dice得分相对提升高达15%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对跨域海马体分割中的内容偏移，在多样化人群中实现准确分割。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了计数幻觉的概念，构建了CountHalluSet数据集，开发了标准化评估协议来量化扩散模型中的计数幻觉现象，并分析了采样条件与常见评估指标的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型在生成任务中取得了显著进展，但经常产生与现实世界知识冲突的幻觉样本，如生成不合理的重复对象。目前缺乏系统量化这些幻觉的方法，阻碍了解决这一挑战的进展。

Method: 构建包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的CountHalluSet数据集，开发标准化评估协议，系统研究不同采样条件（求解器类型、ODE求解器阶数、采样步数、初始噪声）对计数幻觉水平的影响。

Result: 研究发现常用的图像质量指标FID无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉，不同采样条件显著影响计数幻觉水平。

Conclusion: 这项工作朝着系统量化扩散模型中的幻觉迈出了第一步，为图像生成中幻觉现象的研究提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在计算开销高、内存消耗大、视觉保真度差、时间不一致性和伪影等问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入时空特征内存(SFM)缓存先前帧特征，提出特征最相似传播(FMP)方法保持时间一致性，使用SFM更新算法持续刷新缓存特征，并利用交叉注意力图自动提取目标实例掩码。

Result: 实验证明Edit-Your-Interest在效率和视觉保真度方面优于现有最先进方法，具有卓越的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的特征缓存和传播机制，实现了高效、高质量的文本驱动视频编辑，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

*Xijun Wang,Tanay Sharma,Achin Kulshrestha,Abhimitra Meka,Aveek Purohit,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于解决AR/VR环境中AI助手缺乏社交意识的问题，通过多模态上下文建模来检测干预时机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在AR/VR应用中缺乏社交意识，无法判断何时应该干预，导致频繁且不合时宜的响应，干扰自然对话和用户专注度。

Method: 构建了包含13,500个社交视频-问题对的EgoSocial数据集，并提出EgoSoD方法，该方法整合多模态上下文线索（音频和视觉）构建社交思维图，动态建模参与者和互动。

Result: 实验显示现有OLLMs在检测干预时机方面表现不佳（Gemini 2.5 Pro仅14.4%），而EgoSoD方法显著提升了性能：在干预时机检测上提升Phi-4 45.6%、Gemini 2.5 Pro 9.9%；在整体社交互动检测上提升Phi-4 20.4%、Gemini 2.5 Pro 6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法通过多模态社交动态建模有效解决了AI助手在社交互动中的干预时机判断问题，为AR/VR环境中的社交感知AI提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Result: 实验显示DriveCritic在匹配人类偏好方面显著优于现有指标，并表现出强大的上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠、与人类对齐的基础。

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有的网格生成和微分同胚图像配准方法，确保配准变换的质量，提供正雅可比行列式和精确逆变换，这对神经影像工作流程至关重要。

Method: 使用变分原理(VP)生成非折叠网格，控制雅可比行列式和旋度，在微分同胚群中生成逆变换而非图像空间操作。

Result: 在OASIS-1数据集的150个脑部扫描配准中，VPreg在35个感兴趣区域的Dice分数、变换规则性以及逆映射的准确性和一致性方面均优于ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg和FSL-Fnirt。

Conclusion: VPreg在配准精度、变换质量和逆映射准确性方面优于现有最先进方法，为计算解剖学和形态测量学提供了可靠的微分同胚空间变换。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Motivation: 解决文本和图像之间信息熵差异导致的跨模态检索不平衡问题，传统方法难以有效建模两种模态间的语义对应关系。

Method: 1) 设计不依赖任务领域显式知识的提示模板，利用LLM增强文本模态的多义性描述；2) 使用超图适配器构建文本和图像模态间的多边连接，在固定嵌入空间中校正同义语义的正负匹配误差。

Result: 在Flickr30K和MS-COCO基准测试中，文本到图像检索提升16.8%，图像到文本检索提升40.1%，在语义对齐任务中达到新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过LLM的开放语义知识和超图适配器，有效解决了跨模态检索中的信息熵不平衡问题，显著提升了语义对齐性能。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical
implementation.This project provides professional benchmarks for developing
assistive technologies, highlighting trade-offs between recognition precision

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习去噪模型大多在模拟数据或单一真实场景数据上训练，忽略了不同地理区域噪声特性的显著差异，导致模型在新环境中性能下降。

Method: 使用字典学习将TEM信号的内在物理特性（如指数衰减和平滑性）编码为字典驱动先验，在训练时集成到模型中。测试时通过最小化基于字典驱动一致性和信号一阶变化的自监督损失来动态适应新环境。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，该方法在TEM去噪性能上显著优于现有TEM去噪方法和TTA方法。

Conclusion: 提出的DP-TTA方法能够有效利用TEM信号的内在物理特性作为先验知识，通过测试时自适应策略提升模型在新环境中的去噪性能。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Motivation: 传统边缘资源管理方法强调通信吞吐量或通用学习性能，但EGS明确旨在最大化高斯泼溅质量，现有方法不适用。需要解决异构客户端视图贡献差异和因果困境问题。

Method: 提出STT-GS策略：第一阶段从每个客户端采样图像作为导频数据预测损失；第二阶段基于评估结果优先分配通信资源给更有价值的客户端。采用特征域聚类(FDC)选择代表性数据，导频传输时间最小化(PTTM)减少开销。开发联合客户端选择和功率控制(JCSPC)框架，基于惩罚交替主化最小化(PAMM)算法求解。

Result: 在真实数据集上显著优于现有基准方法。面向GS的目标函数可以在低采样比(如10%)下准确预测，在视图贡献和通信成本之间实现良好权衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的方案有效解决了EGS中的资源管理问题，通过智能采样和资源分配策略，在保证场景重建质量的同时优化通信效率。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Motivation: 现有方法主要通过结构改进提升性能，但很少从表示融合角度探索，导致2D图像中丰富的特征多样性未被充分利用。

Method: 提出两阶段占用预测框架CIGOcc，从输入图像中提取分割、图形和深度特征，引入可变形多级融合机制融合这三种多级特征，并融入SAM知识蒸馏。

Result: 在不增加训练成本的情况下，在SemanticKITTI基准上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CIGOcc通过多级表示融合有效提升了相机占用预测的性能，证明了特征融合策略的重要性。

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and
will be released https://github.com/VitaLemonTea1/CIGOcc

Conclusion: 通过发布基础设施和数据集，Paper Copilot有助于社区跟踪评审演变、识别问题，推动建立更稳健、透明和可靠的同行评审系统。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

TL;DR: 提出了MimicParts框架，通过分区感知风格注入和去噪网络，从语音生成更具表现力的3D人体运动，解决了现有方法忽略区域风格差异和动态适应性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在从语音生成风格化3D人体运动时，要么过度简化风格多样性，要么忽略区域运动风格差异（如上身vs下身），且缺乏对语音节奏和情感变化的动态适应能力。

Method: 将身体分为不同区域进行局部运动风格编码，使用分区感知风格注入和分区感知去噪网络，通过分区感知注意力块让节奏和情感线索精确指导每个身体区域。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有方法，能够生成更自然和富有表现力的3D人体运动序列。

Conclusion: MimicParts框架通过分区感知方法有效提升了风格化运动生成的质量，能够捕捉细粒度区域差异并动态适应语音变化。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

TL;DR: 本文对视觉提示(VP)和视觉提示调优(VPT)进行了系统综述，提出了统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，对现有方法进行了分类，并探讨了其在多个领域的应用和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究中VP和VPT概念边界模糊，经常被互换使用，缺乏对这两种技术及其各自应用的系统区分，需要澄清概念并提供清晰的分类框架。

Method: 从第一原理重新审视VP和VPT设计，提出统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，将现有方法分类为可学习、生成式和不可学习提示，并按注入粒度(像素级和token级)进一步组织。

Result: 建立了PA框架和分类体系，考察了PA在医学影像、3D点云、视觉语言任务等领域的集成应用，以及在测试时适应和可信AI中的作用，总结了当前基准和关键挑战。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门针对PA方法论和应用的全面综述，为研究人员和从业者提供了清晰的路线图，以理解和探索PA相关研究的演进格局。

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临前景-背景极度不平衡、缺陷稀疏且尺度分布长尾、低对比度等挑战，现有模型虽然像素级指标良好，但在样本级决策稳定性不足，特别是对小而稀疏的缺陷。

Method: 基于共享编码器的多任务学习框架，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位，通过样本级监督调制特征分布并持续提升小缺陷的召回率。

Conclusion: 提出的样本中心多任务学习框架和评估套件有效解决了工业质检中优化目标与决策粒度不匹配的问题，提升了缺陷检测的实用性和部署价值。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出解决视觉语言模型(VLMs)在否定理解方面的关键失败问题，通过CoVAND数据集和NegToMe模块来改善否定检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在理解否定方面存在严重缺陷，特别是在描述性物体检测任务中表现出肯定性偏见，这限制了模型在实际检测应用中的可靠性。

Method: 提出两个主要贡献：1) CoVAND数据集，使用系统化的思维链和VQA流程生成高质量的实例接地否定数据；2) NegToMe文本标记合并模块，通过将否定线索与属性分组为连贯语义短语来解决架构层面的肯定性偏见问题，并结合参数高效的LoRA微调方法。

Result: 该方法在具有挑战性的否定基准测试中显著提升性能，将NMS-AP在OVDEval上提升高达+10.8点，降低了假阳性率，并证明了对最先进VLMs的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作在解决现实世界检测应用中的否定理解问题方面迈出了关键一步，为视觉语言模型的否定理解能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的矢量提取框架，通过实例-几何交互机制在单一模型中提取多种矢量类型（多边形、折线、线段），解决了现有方法需为不同结构使用单独模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量提取方法通常针对单一矢量类型设计，需要为不同结构使用单独模型，这源于将实例属性（类别、结构）和几何属性（点坐标、连接）独立处理，限制了捕捉复杂结构的能力。

Method: UniVector将矢量编码为包含实例和几何信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块迭代更新，实现跨层级上下文交换，并使用动态形状约束来优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 实验表明UniVector在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一的实例-几何交互框架，成功实现了在单一模型中提取多种矢量类型，为矢量提取领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉。

Method: 使用显式提示将空间运动信息转换为自然语言描述，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，通过CLIP文本编码器动态调整，并设计判别性特征增强器。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的大量实验表明，EPIPTrack在多样化场景中优于现有跟踪器。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack展现出强大的适应性和优越性能，为多模态跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗性补丁攻击(EDPA)及相应的防御策略。EDPA是一种模型无关的攻击方法，通过破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐来干扰VLA模型的决策，导致机器人任务失败。同时提出了对抗性微调防御方案来缓解这种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人学习中取得了革命性进展，但其对抗鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白，研究VLA模型的对抗脆弱性并开发相应的防御机制。

Method: 提出了Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA)攻击方法：1)破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐；2)最大化对抗性和干净视觉输入之间潜在表示的差异。同时提出了对抗性微调防御方案，优化视觉编码器使其对干净和对抗性扰动输入产生相似的潜在表示。

Result: 在LIBERO机器人仿真基准测试上的广泛评估表明，EDPA显著提高了最先进VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御方法有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了VLA模型在对抗性攻击下的脆弱性，并提出了有效的攻击和防御方法，为构建更鲁棒的VLA系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 现有的人群计数方法在嵌入式系统应用中存在模型参数过多、计算复杂等问题，而嵌入式系统的实际应用要求模型具有实时性，需要足够快的推理速度。

Conclusion: 该模型在嵌入式系统上实现了超实时的人群计数性能，同时保持了有竞争力的准确率，解决了现有方法在嵌入式应用中的计算复杂性问题。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频大语言模型在视频问答任务上取得进展，但其内部如何提取和传播视频与文本信息的机制仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析VideoLLMs的内部信息流，研究不同层在处理视频问答任务时的功能分工。

Result: 发现四个一致模式：1）早期到中间层进行跨帧交互；2）中间层完成视频-语言集成；3）中后层生成答案；4）通过选择有效信息路径，模型可在减少大量注意力边的情况下保持性能（如LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT减少58%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VideoLLMs执行时序推理的机制，为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

### [40] [End-to-End Multi-Modal Diffusion Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13253)
*Chunhao Lu,Qiang Lu,Meichen Dong,Jake Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDM提出了一种基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器实现多模态编码和解码，在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答等任务中显著优于现有端到端模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了各种模态的联合表示学习。为了统一多模态处理，需要新的架构。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器逐步生成和精炼模态特定信息，实现编码和解码的统一处理。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理任务中，MDM显著优于现有端到端模型（MonoFormer、LlamaGen、Chameleon等），并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro、Mistral等SOTA模型有效竞争。

Conclusion: MDM在多模态处理统一化方面表现出色，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的解码策略，通过自增强提示和自适应阈值算法来减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉对比解码方法使用通用的视觉增强，忽略了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了其有效性

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询和视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个标记候选大小

Result: 在4个LVLM和7个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进的解码方法显著提高了事实一致性

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了整合查询相关增强和熵感知解码对于改善LVLM有效生成的重要性

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

TL;DR: MMLongCite是一个评估大视觉语言模型在长上下文场景中忠实度的基准，包含8个任务、6种上下文长度区间和多种模态。评估发现现有模型在处理长多模态上下文时忠实度有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型的上下文窗口不断扩大，但扩展的上下文窗口并不保证能有效利用上下文，这对实际应用构成关键挑战。当前评估主要关注纯文本领域，多模态评估仍局限于短上下文。

Method: 引入MMLongCite基准，包含8个不同任务，覆盖6个上下文长度区间，整合文本、图像和视频等多种模态，对最先进的大视觉语言模型进行评估。

Result: 评估显示现有大视觉语言模型在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实度有限，深入分析了上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型忠实度的影响。

Conclusion: 需要开发更有效的方法来提升大视觉语言模型在长多模态上下文中的忠实度，MMLongCite为这一研究方向提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaskDCPT预训练方法，通过退化类型分类和图像重建的双重任务，实现通用图像恢复的预训练，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中表现有限，需要一种能够同时处理多种退化类型和级别的通用预训练方法。

Method: 使用掩码退化分类预训练，包含编码器和两个解码器：分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器重建高质量图像，结合掩码图像建模和对比学习。

Result: 在5D全合一恢复任务中PSNR至少提升3.77dB，真实场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型和级别表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT为通用图像恢复提供了有效的预训练方法，同时发布了包含250万对样本的UIR-2.5M数据集。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at

*MingZe Tang,Jubal Chandy Jacob*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在视觉语言模型进行零样本分类时，简单提示词比详细描述性提示词效果更好，这种现象被称为"提示词过拟合"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在零样本分类中，提示词设计对识别视觉相似类别（如人体姿势）的影响。

Method: 在285张COCO数据集图像上，使用OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip等现代VLM模型，采用三层次提示词设计，系统性地增加语言细节。

Result: 性能最好的模型（MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP）使用最简单的基本提示词效果最佳，详细描述反而显著降低性能（MetaCLIP 2准确率从68.8%降至55.1%）；而性能较差的SigLip模型在模糊类别上使用详细提示词时表现更好。

Conclusion: 提示词设计对VLM性能有重要影响，高性能模型倾向于简单提示词，而低性能模型可能从详细描述中受益，揭示了"提示词过拟合"现象。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构因果模型的3D点云新类发现分割方法，通过因果表示和推理联合学习来解决基类和新类之间的关联问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在点云新类发现分割中，基类和新类之间的相关性学习往往较为粗糙或统计性，容易导致新类推断混淆。通过引入因果关系作为强相关约束，可以揭示与类别准确对应的本质点云表示。

Method: 使用结构因果模型重新形式化3D-NCD问题，提出因果表示和推理联合学习方法。首先分析基类表示中的隐藏混杂因子，设计因果表示原型来消除混杂因子，然后使用图结构建模基类因果表示原型与新类原型之间的因果关系。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割上的大量实验和可视化结果证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过因果表示和推理的联合学习，能够有效解决点云新类发现分割问题，准确捕捉基类和新类之间的本质关联。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GPU并行计算的SfM方法，通过加速标准SfM流程中的关键阶段，在保持重建精度的同时实现了约40倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP、GLOMAP）在处理大规模场景时存在计算开销大、灵活性有限的问题，而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM、VGGT）在GPU内存消耗方面无法扩展到数千张输入图像。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速标准SfM流程的每个关键阶段，基于稀疏感知的束调整优化技术，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速BA和GP。

Result: 在不同规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法比COLMAP快约40倍，同时保持了相当甚至更好的重建精度，能够处理5000张图像的大规模场景。

Conclusion: 该方法成功释放了GPU并行计算的潜力，在保持SfM重建精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，解决了大规模场景重建的挑战。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

Motivation: 日常生活中，人们的注意力受到所消费和看到的内容的高度影响。吸引和保持注意力（即视觉趣味性）至关重要。随着大型多模态模型的发展，研究者希望探索这些模型在理解视觉趣味性概念方面的潜力。

Method: 通过比较分析研究人类评估与GPT-4o预测之间的对齐程度，利用GPT-4o对图像对的趣味性进行标注，然后将这些标注数据用于训练学习排序模型。

Result: 研究发现人类与GPT-4o在视觉趣味性评估上存在部分对齐，GPT-4o在捕捉视觉趣味性概念方面表现优于现有最先进方法，能够有效标注图像对的趣味性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为更深入理解人类兴趣铺平了道路，证明了大型多模态模型在视觉趣味性分析方面的潜力。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练策略，可以在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的代价体积，显著提高推理速度和减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于经验观察发现，当网络其他部分（如RAFT-based pipeline）充分训练后，代价体积的重要性会降低。代价体积的计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧的分辨率。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的代价体积。创建了三个不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到最先进精度，同时比可比模型快1.2倍且内存占用降低6倍；最快的模型能够在仅使用500MB GPU内存的情况下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 该训练策略能够有效移除代价体积，在保持精度的同时显著提升光流估计的推理速度和内存效率。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态嵌入方法在捕捉候选样本间细微语义差异方面存在困难，负样本缺乏多样性，且难以区分假负样本和硬负样本。

Method: 首先通过全局检索构建潜在硬负样本集，然后引入MLLM-as-a-Judge机制评估查询-候选对的语义对齐并生成软语义匹配分数，用于硬负样本挖掘和软标签训练。

Result: 在MMEB基准测试和多个检索任务上进行了全面实验，证明该方法在所有任务上平均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的UniME-V2模型通过MLLM增强的表示学习方法，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在多模态嵌入任务中取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Conclusion: Group-VQ改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，训练后码本重采样提供了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于智能体的流式基准测试，研究文化组成和渐进模糊化如何影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性，发现不同文化群体在模糊条件下的性能退化曲线存在不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，缺乏对文化差异和感知退化条件下鲁棒性的系统研究。

Method: 使用基于智能体的方法，在冻结的CLIP特征空间中训练轻量级残差适配器，在5x5格子上模拟智能体移动和交互，环境提供按sigma调度的模糊输入。

Result: JAFFE（亚洲）群体在低模糊时性能更高但中段下降更快，KDEF（西方）群体退化更均匀；混合群体呈现中间模式，平衡混合缓解早期退化但不平衡设置会放大多数群体弱点。

Conclusion: 文化组成和交互结构显著影响面部表情识别在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性，量化了这些因素的作用。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

TL;DR: DepthVLA是一个增强空间推理能力的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过集成预训练的深度预测模块来提升空间感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上表现不佳，因为它们从视觉-语言模型继承的空间推理能力有限，且需要大量动作数据预训练来在3D空间中定位。

Method: 采用混合变换器设计，统一了视觉-语言模型、深度变换器和动作专家，通过完全共享注意力形成端到端模型。

Result: 在真实世界和模拟环境中的广泛评估显示，DepthVLA优于最先进方法：真实世界任务78.5% vs 65.0%，LIBERO模拟器94.9% vs 93.6%，Simpler模拟器74.8% vs 58.8%。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过显式整合空间感知能力，有效提升了VLA模型的空间推理性能，在各种环境中都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

TL;DR: 提出GLSDA框架，利用预训练大模型的语义先验增强WiFi手势识别的泛化能力和语义表达能力，通过双路径CSI编码、多尺度语义编码器和鲁棒双蒸馏策略，在Widar3.0基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有WiFi手势识别方法因CSI域敏感性和缺乏高级手势抽象而导致的泛化能力有限和语义表达能力不足的问题。

Method: 设计双路径CSI编码管道捕获几何和动态手势模式，使用多尺度语义编码器学习鲁棒时序嵌入并通过跨模态注意力对齐语义，引入语义感知软监督方案增强类别区分，开发鲁棒双蒸馏策略压缩模型。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务中均优于最先进方法，同时显著减小模型大小和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实世界AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanvasMAR是一个新的视频掩码自回归模型，通过引入画布机制解决现有MAR模型的两个主要问题：慢启动问题和误差累积问题，能够在更少的自回归步骤中生成高质量视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MAR模型存在两个主要限制：慢启动问题（早期采样阶段缺乏结构化全局先验）以及在空间和时间维度上的自回归误差累积问题。

Method: 提出画布机制——对下一帧的模糊全局预测，作为掩码生成的起点；引入组合式无分类器引导，联合放大空间（画布）和时间条件；使用基于噪声的画布增强来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中，CanvasMAR能够以更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频，在Kinetics-600数据集上取得了显著性能，与基于扩散的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频MAR模型的慢启动和误差累积问题，在减少计算成本的同时提高了视频生成质量。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial-DISE基准，基于认知分类法评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，特别关注内在动态空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估空间推理能力，特别是人类空间认知的基本方面——内在动态空间推理。

Method: 开发了可扩展的自动化流水线生成多样化且可验证的空间推理问题，创建了包含559个评估VQA对和12K+训练VQA对的数据集。

Result: 对28个最先进VLM的评估显示，当前模型与人类能力存在较大差距，特别是在多步骤多视角空间推理方面。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健框架、有价值数据集和明确方向，推动实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

TL;DR: MVCustom是一个新颖的扩散框架，旨在同时实现多视角一致性和个性化定制，解决了现有模型无法统一相机姿态控制和几何一致性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视角生成模型不支持几何一致的定制化，而定制化模型缺乏明确的视角控制，难以统一这两种功能。

Method: 使用特征场表示学习主体身份和几何，结合增强的文本到视频扩散骨干网络，采用深度感知特征渲染和一致性感知潜在补全技术。

Result: MVCustom是唯一能同时实现忠实多视角生成和定制化的框架。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了多视角定制化任务，在保持几何一致性的同时实现了精确的视角控制。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

TL;DR: 提出了Mask-GRPO方法，首次将基于GRPO的强化学习应用于被忽视的掩码生成模型范式，通过重新定义转移概率并将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，显著提升了文本到图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，而忽视了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案，因此需要开发专门针对掩码生成模型的RL方法。

Method: 提出Mask-GRPO方法，重新定义转移概率，将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，并采用移除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等增强策略。

Result: 在标准文本到图像基准测试和偏好对齐方面显著提升了基础模型Show-o的性能，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将RL引入掩码生成模型，为该范式提供了有效的强化学习解决方案，在文本到图像生成任务上取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，通过两阶段适配器架构实现4K+分辨率，同时保持内容一致性和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于较低分辨率，无法在高分辨率下保持内容一致性和提示对齐，这些挑战随着分辨率和纹理复杂度的增加而加剧。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器学习掩码和非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器实现补丁级注意力机制，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，解决了大规模修复中的常见伪影问题，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Patch-Adapter通过解耦全局语义和局部优化的双阶段架构，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距问题。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

TL;DR: 提出LogViG模型，使用对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法改进视觉图神经网络，通过限制长距离连接数量来解决现有方法的过压缩问题，在图像分类和语义分割任务中超越现有ViG、CNN和ViT架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉图神经网络(ViG)的图构建方法如KNN在较大图像上计算昂贵，而SVGA等方法因固定步长尺度会导致过压缩和缺失长距离连接信息。

Method: 提出LSGC图构建方法限制长距离连接数量，构建LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型，引入高分辨率分支并在高低分辨率分支间融合特征，形成多尺度高分辨率视觉GNN网络。

Result: LogViG在准确率、GMACs和参数量方面均优于现有ViG、CNN和ViT架构。最小模型Ti-LogViG在ImageNet-1K上平均top-1准确率达79.9%，比Vision GNN高1.7%，参数量减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC在ViG图构建中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进ViG的性能。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoDS方法解决自动驾驶中异构场景下的协作感知问题，通过轻量级空间通道调整器和基于域分离的分布对齐来有效处理特征差异，同时保持高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同编码器，但实际部署中存在异构性。传统方法将邻居特征对齐到自车特征容易受域差距噪声影响，且基于transformer的域适应模块在移动设备上推理效率低。

Method: CoDS采用轻量级空间通道调整器(LSCR)进行空间和通道维度特征对齐，使用域分离分布对齐(DADS)模块分离域依赖信息和任务相关信息，并通过域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失增强域分离过程。

Result: 实验表明CoDS能有效缓解异构场景下的特征差异，在检测精度和推理效率之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: CoDS通过域分离策略成功解决了异构协作感知中的特征差异问题，同时保持了高效推理能力，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图表和图表等结构化视觉内容上的精确推理存在困难，因为基于像素的感知缺乏验证机制。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后使用评论器选择最忠实的重建，并迭代优化代码。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA和Geometry3K等多个视觉推理基准测试中，RECODE显著优于不使用代码或仅使用代码进行辅助线绘制或裁剪的方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为更准确和可验证的多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素上操作，难以分离对物理场景属性的选择性。需要表征神经元对形状、姿态、光照等3D场景属性的选择性。

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，用径向基函数参数化网格变形，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和尺度，同时强制几何正则化。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区模型，能够探测神经元对姿态和光照等可解释3D因素的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆图形学与系统神经科学联系起来，提供了一种超越传统像素方法、基于物理基础的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation

### [66] [Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging Applications in Food Analysis -- Improving Algorithms and Methodologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13452)
*Ole-Christian Galbo Engstrøm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中的应用，比较了卷积神经网络和偏最小二乘法的性能，发现CNN在联合空间-光谱分析中表现更优，并开发了两个开源Python包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像技术在食品质量分析中的有效应用方法，特别是比较深度学习方法与传统化学计量学方法的性能差异。

Method: 通过四个研究进行实验，比较基于卷积神经网络和偏最小二乘法的模型，包括2D CNN增强光谱卷积层的方法，以及使用RGB图像、NIR光谱和NIR-HSI图像分析大麦发芽能力。

Result: CNN在联合空间-光谱分析中优于PLS方法；增强光谱卷积层的2D CNN能改善化学图谱生成；对于平均化学成分分析，PLS表现同样良好；大麦发芽能力分析因数据问题结果不确定。

Conclusion: NIR-HSI结合CNN在食品质量分析中具有优势，特别是对于需要空间分布信息的参数；PLS仍适用于平均成分分析；开发了两个开源工具包促进相关研究。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIST3A框架通过将文本到视频生成器与3D重建解码器结合，实现了高质量的文本到3D生成，解决了模型拼接和潜在表示对齐两个关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合现代潜在文本到视频模型和3D重建系统的能力，创建强大的3D场景生成器，利用两者各自的优势实现更好的文本到3D生成效果。

Method: 1. 使用模型拼接技术，在3D解码器中找到与文本到视频生成器潜在表示最匹配的层进行连接；2. 采用直接奖励微调方法对齐文本到视频生成器与拼接后的3D解码器，确保生成的潜在表示可解码为一致的3D场景几何。

Result: 与现有输出高斯溅射的文本到3D模型相比，所有测试的配对组合都显著改进。通过选择合适的3D基础模型，VIST3A还能实现高质量的文本到点云生成。

Conclusion: VIST3A框架成功地将文本到视频生成和3D重建能力相结合，为文本到3D生成提供了有效的解决方案，在多个评估指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了三种无需训练的VPR不确定性度量方法，通过分析相似性得分的统计模式来估计匹配置信度，在多种VPR方法和数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VPR系统在视觉环境变化、光照条件、季节变化和视角变化时面临挑战，而关键应用如SLAM中的闭环检测需要鲁棒的不确定性估计。

Method: 提出了三种无需训练的不确定性度量：相似性分布(SD)量化候选得分间的分离度，比率扩展(RS)评估顶级得分位置的竞争模糊性，统计不确定性(SU)结合SD和RS提供统一度量。

Result: 在9种先进VPR方法和6个基准数据集上的综合评估表明，这些度量在区分正确和错误VPR匹配方面表现出色，优于现有方法且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 所提出的不确定性度量方法无需额外训练或架构修改，在实时机器人应用中具有部署可行性，能在各种环境条件下提高精度-召回性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Motivation: 当前完全开源的多模态大语言模型落后于专有模型，主要原因是监督微调数据质量存在显著差距，现有开源数据集存在广泛噪声且缺乏复杂推理数据。

Method: 1. 构建包含约1500万问答对的Honey-Data-15M数据集，采用多重清洗技术；2. 提出双级（短和长）CoT增强策略；3. 开发HoneyPipe数据整理流水线和DataStudio框架；4. 训练8B参数的Bee-8B模型。

Conclusion: 通过系统化关注数据质量，可以开发出与半开源模型具有竞争力的完全开源多模态大语言模型，为社区提供了一套基础资源。

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Conclusion: 该模型具有出色的适应性和泛化能力，可用于开发实际环境中的端到端情感识别系统，代码和结果已公开。

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

TL;DR: 提出Generative Universal Verifier概念，构建ViVerBench基准测试，训练OmniVerifier-7B通用视觉验证器，并提出OmniVerifier-TTS测试时扩展范式，提升多模态推理的可信度和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视觉结果验证方面存在显著不足，与人类水平的可靠视觉验证能力有较大差距，需要开发能够进行反思和优化的通用验证能力。

Method: 1) 构建ViVerBench基准测试；2) 设计自动化流水线构建大规模视觉验证数据，训练OmniVerifier-7B通用验证器；3) 提出OmniVerifier-TTS序列测试时扩展范式，通过迭代优化提升生成能力上限。

Result: OmniVerifier-7B在ViVerBench上提升8.3分，OmniVerifier-TTS在T2I-ReasonBench和GenEval++上分别提升3.7分和4.3分，优于现有并行测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: 通过赋予多模态推理可靠的视觉验证能力，OmniVerifier在生成过程中的可靠反思和可扩展测试时优化方面取得进展，推动下一代可信可控推理系统的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用动作单元作为非瞬态特征来解决增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在复杂情感识别任务中取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增量学习过程中容易发生灾难性遗忘，主要是因为任务间的瞬态特征不匹配。本文专注于复杂情感识别，希望像人类一样先学习基本情感，再增量学习复杂情感。

Method: 使用描述面部肌肉运动的动作单元作为非瞬态、高度语义化的特征，这些特征优于浅层和深层卷积神经网络提取的特征。

Result: 在CFEE数据集上，增量学习复杂复合情感的准确率达到0.75，与最先进方法相比具有竞争力，且模型轻量、内存占用小。

Conclusion: 动作单元作为非瞬态特征能有效缓解增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在复杂情感识别任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有商业3D乳房扫描解决方案成本高昂且需要专用硬件，而现有低成本替代方案效果不佳。本文旨在开发一种无需专用硬件或专有软件、可在任何能录制RGB视频的设备上使用的低成本3D乳房重建方法。

Method: 使用现成的运动恢复结构(SfM)流程，结合提出的局部隐式乳房形状模型(liRBSM)。该模型将隐式乳房域分解为多个小区域，每个区域由锚定在解剖标志位置的局部神经SDF表示，相比全局SDF模型能提供更详细的表面重建。

Result: 提出的liRBSM模型在重建质量上显著优于iRBSM，能够恢复高质量的3D乳房几何形状，误差小于2毫米。整个流程快速（少于6分钟），完全透明且开源。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种低成本、易获取且准确的3D乳房重建解决方案，无需专用硬件，可在普通设备上实现高质量的重建效果。

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了GPU和FPGA在视觉SLAM中加速特征检测的性能，发现对于传统特征检测器(FAST、Harris)，GPU实现更优；而对于学习型检测器(SuperPoint)，FPGA在运行性能和能效上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM系统中耗时且耗能的模块，而当前在功耗受限平台(如无人机)上部署SLAM的需求日益增长，需要评估不同硬件加速方案的优劣。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal等现代SoC上，比较GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器在视觉SLAM流水线中的性能。

Result: 传统特征检测器(FAST、Harris)的GPU实现比FPGA实现性能更好、能效更高；而学习型检测器SuperPoint的FPGA实现比GPU实现性能提升3.1倍、能效提升1.4倍。FPGA加速的V-SLAM在5个数据集序列中有2个达到更高FPS。

Conclusion: 硬件加速特征检测可减少全局束调整调用频率而不损失精度。对于传统检测器推荐GPU加速，对于学习型检测器FPGA加速更具优势，但GPU加速的V-SLAM整体精度更高。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述分析了医学图像增强领域的关键挑战、最新进展和评估指标，基于39项同行评审研究，发现低对比度和噪声是最常见问题，MRI和多模态成像研究最多，而组织病理学等专业模态研究不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像常受噪声、伪影和低对比度等问题影响，限制了诊断潜力。需要强大的预处理、去噪算法和先进的增强方法来提高图像质量和可解释性。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法的系统文献综述，分析了39项同行评审研究，涵盖不同成像模态和增强方法。

Result: 39项研究中，29项使用传统数学方法，9项关注深度学习技术，1项探索混合方法。在图像质量评估方面，18项研究同时使用参考和非参考指标，9项仅使用参考指标，12项仅使用非参考指标，共引入65个IQA指标，主要为非参考指标。

Conclusion: 该综述突出了当前局限性、研究空白以及推进医学图像增强的潜在未来方向，特别是针对专业成像模态的进一步研究需求。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

### [79] [Towards Adversarial Robustness and Uncertainty Quantification in DINOv2-based Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13643)
*Akib Mohammed Khan,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了基于DINOv2的少样本异常检测器在对抗攻击下的脆弱性和不确定性校准问题，提出了攻击检测机制和不确定性量化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DINOv2的异常检测器在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性和不确定性校准能力尚未得到充分研究，这限制了其在安全关键场景中的实际应用。

Method: 在AnomalyDINO基础上，通过添加轻量级线性头来生成对抗扰动，评估FGSM攻击效果，并应用Platt缩放进行后验校准以实现不确定性估计。

Result: 研究发现微小扰动就能改变特征空间中的最近邻关系导致误分类，且原始异常分数校准性差。经过校准后，对抗样本的预测熵显著高于干净样本，可用于攻击检测。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性和原则性不确定性量化是异常检测系统可信赖部署的必备能力，研究揭示了DINOv2基础检测器的具体漏洞并建立了评估基准。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文精确的图像超分辨率框架，通过局部-全局上下文感知注意力机制保持像素关系，并采用分布和感知对齐的条件机制来增强感知保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的超分辨率方法在处理多样化和高度退化图像时，往往会产生噪声放大或错误内容生成的问题，需要改进以保持结构一致性和细节恢复质量。

Method: 使用局部-全局上下文感知注意力机制来维护局部和全局像素关系，并提出分布和感知对齐的像素空间条件机制，从局部细节到全局结构逐步保留和细化结构信息。

Result: 在多个超分辨率基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法能够生成高质量、结构一致且感知准确的图像重建结果，有效减少伪影并确保真实的细节恢复。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在图像超分辨率任务中表现出色，能够生成高保真度、感知准确的图像重建，解决了现有方法在处理退化图像时的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在图像编辑方面取得显著进展，但扩展到3D编辑仍面临挑战，主要由于计算需求大、闭源API限制和成本问题，使得将这些模型集成到现有迭代编辑策略中不切实际。

Method: 提出EditCast3D管道，使用视频生成基础模型从单帧第一帧传播编辑到整个数据集，引入视图选择策略识别一致且适合重建的视图，采用前馈重建无需昂贵细化。

Result: 在常用3D编辑数据集上评估，与最先进的3D编辑基线相比，展示了优越的编辑质量和高效性。

Conclusion: EditCast3D为将基础模型集成到3D编辑管道提供了一个可扩展和通用的范例，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

TL;DR: OmniGaze是一个半监督3D视线估计框架，利用大规模无标注数据解决领域偏差问题，通过伪标签策略和奖励模型提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法在跨领域泛化方面表现不佳，主要由于标注数据稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化的无标注面部图像数据集，采用伪标签策略并设计奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和多模态大语言模型的语义线索计算置信度分数。

Result: 在五个数据集上实现最先进性能，在领域内和跨领域设置下均表现优异，在四个未见数据集上展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: OmniGaze不仅是一个有效的视线估计方法，还能作为可扩展的数据引擎，显著提升3D视线估计的泛化性能。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

Motivation: 开放域视觉实体识别面临固定标签集、有限监督、高视觉模糊性和语义消歧等挑战，需要处理训练期间未见的长尾分布实体。

Method: 使用知识引导的对比学习框架，将视觉和文本输入抽象到概念层面，利用实体描述、类型层次结构和关系上下文，在Wikidata结构化信息基础上构建共享语义空间。

Result: 在OVEN基准测试中，最小模型相比现有最佳方法在未见实体上的准确率提升了10.5%，且模型尺寸小了35倍。

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识能显著提升开放域视觉实体识别性能，特别是对罕见和未见实体的识别效果。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

TL;DR: FlashWorld是一个从单张图像或文本提示快速生成3D场景的生成模型，比之前工作快10-100倍，同时具有更优的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多视图导向方法生成多视图图像再进行3D重建，而3D导向方法直接生成3D高斯表示但视觉质量较差。FlashWorld旨在结合两种范式的优势。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：首先预训练支持MV导向和3D导向的双模式多视图扩散模型，然后通过跨模式后训练蒸馏，将3D导向模式分布匹配到高质量MV导向模式，同时利用大量单视图图像和文本提示增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明该方法在质量和效率上均优于现有方法，能够快速生成高质量的3D一致场景。

Conclusion: FlashWorld成功实现了快速高质量的3D场景生成，通过双模式训练策略有效结合了两种范式的优势，显著提升了生成速度和视觉质量。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成健康反事实图像在医学成像中具有重要应用价值，如异常检测和健康扫描分析工具的应用。现有方法在平衡异常去除和主体特征保留方面存在挑战。

Method: 使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），不仅以健康图像为初始条件，还以合成的病理图像为最终条件，将病理图像作为结构信息先验来指导生成过程。

Result: DDBM在分割和异常检测任务中优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBM能够生成与患者解剖结构高度匹配的健康反事实图像，同时选择性去除病理区域，为医学成像应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

Motivation: 现代AI模型在提供良性查询有用响应的同时拒绝恶意查询面临挑战，特别是对嵌入有害意图的多模态查询存在脆弱性。传统安全对齐方法训练成本高，推理时对齐方法存在过度拒绝良性查询和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 通过重写查询增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，进行查询级风险评估，然后基于评估的风险自适应引导模型激活，在不进行迭代输出调整的情况下生成响应。

Result: 在多个多模态安全和效用基准测试中，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: RAS方法有效解决了多模态查询的安全对齐问题，在保证安全性的同时提升了模型效用和推理效率。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是脑部重要动脉网络，传统骨架化技术难以提取可靠中心线，且公开中心线数据集稀缺，需要开发自动化评估方法。

Method: 结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接算法，从TopCoW数据集中提取和整理中心线图和形态特征，包括200名卒中患者的MRA和CTA影像。

Result: 算法在测试集上拓扑重建准确度F1=1，节点平均欧氏距离小于1体素，半径、长度等特征相对误差中位数低于5%，皮尔逊相关系数高于0.95。

Conclusion: 基于学习的骨架化结合图连接能实现解剖学上合理的中心线提取，强调评估解剖准确性和特征鲁棒性的重要性，已发布数据集和基线算法支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CSS-Diff框架，通过循环自监督扩散模型从低场MRI合成高质量高场MRI图像，解决临床保真度问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI成本低、可及性好、安全性高，但存在分辨率低和信噪比差的问题。合成高场MRI可以减少对昂贵采集的依赖，但现有方法存在临床保真度差距，需要保持解剖保真度、增强细粒度结构细节并弥合图像对比度域差距

Method: 提出循环自监督扩散(CSS-Diff)框架，在循环一致性约束下重新制定基于扩散的合成。包含切片间间隙感知网络通过对比学习对齐切片间不一致性，以及局部结构校正网络通过掩码和扰动补丁的自重建增强局部特征恢复

Result: 在跨场合成任务中达到最先进性能(PSNR: 31.80±2.70 dB, SSIM: 0.943±0.102, LPIPS: 0.0864±0.0689)。相比原始低场MRI，保留了细粒度解剖结构(左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%，皮层从4.2%降至3.7%)

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成在定量上可靠且在解剖学上一致的图像

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCalli是一个统一的扩散框架，用于中文书法的列级识别和生成，通过联合训练实现字符结构保持与风格布局先验的协同提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复制中文书法时存在局限：要么生成高质量单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性。

Method: 采用联合训练的扩散框架，使用不对称噪声和栅格化框图提供空间先验，在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合数据集上训练。

Result: 模型在生成质量上达到最先进水平，具有优越的连笔连续性和布局保真度，同时识别能力更强，并能扩展到其他古文字。

Conclusion: UniCalli框架通过识别与生成的协同作用，在有限数据情况下提升两个任务性能，成功应用于多种古文字复制。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

TL;DR: InteractiveOmni是一个开源的轻量级全模态大语言模型（4B-8B参数），整合了视觉、音频编码器、大语言模型和语音解码器，支持多轮音视频交互，在保持轻量化的同时实现了先进的跨模态理解和语音生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有轻量级模型在多模态理解和语音交互方面的不足，特别是缺乏多轮对话记忆能力的问题，开发一个统一的全模态交互模型。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略：先进行全模态理解预训练，然后进行语音对话和音视频交互的后训练。精心构建多轮训练数据集，并建立了多模态多轮记忆基准和多轮语音交互基准进行评估。

Result: InteractiveOmni显著优于领先的开源模型，在长时记忆能力方面表现突出。4B版本在通用基准上与Qwen2.5-Omni-7B相当，仅用50%模型大小就能达到8B版本97%的性能。

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni在图像、音频、视频理解和语音生成任务上达到了同类尺寸模型的SOTA性能，为下一代智能交互系统提供了可访问的开源基础。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-MMMU基准测试，系统评估多模态模型中视觉理解和生成能力的双向协同作用，涵盖科学、编程、数学等8个推理领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试很少真正检验视觉理解和生成的集成，现有评估要么孤立处理这两种能力，要么忽略它们内在耦合的任务。

Method: 创建包含可验证中间推理步骤、独特真实值和可重复评分协议的综合性基准测试，每个任务都双向耦合，要求模型利用概念理解指导视觉合成或使用生成作为分析推理的认知支架。

Result: 通过对最先进的统一模型、纯生成模型和纯理解模型的广泛评估，揭示了显著的性能差距和跨模态依赖性。

Conclusion: 为理解这些能力何时以及如何相互增强提供了新见解，并为推进统一模型建立了可靠基础。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

*Seyed Mohammad Mousavi,Morteza Analoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AVC框架用于基于扩散模型的故事续写，通过CLIP检索最相关的先前图像，并在没有足够相关图像时自适应限制视觉上下文的影响，同时使用LLM重新标注数据集以提升数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事续写中如何有效利用先前视觉上下文同时确保与当前文本输入语义对齐的挑战，避免误导或不相关信息的影响。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索语义对齐的先前图像，在扩散过程早期自适应限制视觉上下文影响，并利用大语言模型重新标注数据集以增强文本监督。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估显示，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线方法，特别是在先前视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性场景中。

Conclusion: AVC框架能够有效利用视觉上下文，同时避免不相关信息的影响，在故事续写任务中实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisePrints是一种轻量级水印方案，利用扩散过程初始化随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要。现有方法需要访问模型权重且计算量大，不实用且不可扩展。

Method: 利用扩散过程初始噪声与生成内容的强相关性，通过哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，确保从内容中恢复有效种子不可行。使用密码学零知识证明来证明所有权而不泄露种子。

Result: 在多个最先进的图像和视频扩散模型上验证了NoisePrints，仅使用种子和输出即可高效验证，无需模型权重。

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种实用且可扩展的水印方案，有效保护扩散模型生成内容的版权，同时保持验证过程的轻量级特性。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GS-Reasoner模型，通过双路径池化机制构建统一的3D表示，首次实现无需外部模块的自回归3D视觉定位，并显著提升空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLMs缺乏能同时捕捉语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示，无需增加输入token数量。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得优异结果，显著增强空间推理能力，达到最先进性能水平。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一且自包含的3D空间推理框架，通过GCoT数据集进一步连接定位与空间推理，证明了3D视觉定位是空间推理的基石。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出Trajectory Field表示方法，将视频表示为每个像素的连续3D轨迹函数，并开发Trace Anything神经网络一次性预测整个轨迹场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于像素是视频动态的原始元素，每个像素在时间上形成连续3D轨迹，需要有效的时空表示来建模和理解视频动态。

Method: 使用Trajectory Field表示视频，为每个像素预测一组控制点来参数化B样条轨迹，Trace Anything模型通过单次前向传播预测整个轨迹场。

Result: 在新轨迹场估计基准上达到最先进性能，在点跟踪基准上表现有竞争力；具有显著效率优势；展现出目标条件操作、运动预测和时空融合等涌现能力。

Conclusion: Trajectory Field是视频动态建模的有效表示方法，Trace Anything模型实现了高效准确的轨迹预测，并具有多种应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在遇到与预训练数据分布差异较大的新领域时性能急剧下降，现有领域适应方法存在领域特定特征学习有限或灾难性遗忘的问题。

Method: 提出VisCoP方法，在VLM的视觉编码器中添加少量可学习的视觉探针，实现高效的领域特定适应，同时最小化对预训练参数的修改。

Result: 在跨视角、跨模态和跨任务三个挑战性领域适应设置中，VisCoP始终优于现有适应策略，在目标领域获得优越性能并有效保留源领域知识。

Conclusion: VisCoP通过视觉探针机制实现了大视觉语言模型的高效领域适应，在多个挑战性场景下都表现出色，同时避免了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

TL;DR: PhysMaster通过物理表征学习和强化学习人类反馈，提升视频生成模型的物理合理性，使其能够生成符合物理定律的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉逼真的视频，但往往违反物理定律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力。需要增强模型的物理感知能力。

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，设计PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为额外条件；应用强化学习人类反馈和直接偏好优化(DPO)来优化物理表征学习。

Result: PhysMaster能够提高PhysEncoder和视频生成的物理感知能力，在简单代理任务上证明其有效性，并具有广泛的物理场景泛化能力。

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表征学习，为各种物理过程提供了统一解决方案，可作为物理感知视频生成和更广泛应用的通用即插即用方案。

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

TL;DR: 提出了RID框架，一种低计算成本的元提示技术，用于在零样本情况下引导LLM进行人类对齐的异常处理，显著提升决策与人类常识的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为智能体推理引擎存在规则刚性缺陷，即僵化遵循显式规则导致决策与人类常识和意图不一致，而传统的监督微调方法计算成本高且难以普及。

Method: RID框架通过结构化认知模式，让模型能够解构任务、分类规则、权衡冲突结果并最终为其决策提供理由，是一种零样本元提示技术。

Result: 在20个需要微妙判断的场景基准测试中，RID框架达到95%的人类对齐分数，显著优于基线(80%)和思维链提示(75%)，并能产生更高质量、意图驱动的推理。

Conclusion: RID框架提供了一种实用、可访问且有效的方法，能够引导LLM从字面指令遵循转向自由、目标导向的推理，为构建更可靠和实用的AI智能体铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖推理阶段的隐式规划，要么引入显式规划器但未系统优化规划阶段。研究发现规划令牌在强化学习中表现出显著更高的熵，揭示未优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架：1）使用基于熵的项塑造令牌级优势，为高熵令牌分配更大更新；2）选择性加权规划密集型样本的样本级优势。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试中，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，并以显著更低的训练预算实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统优化规划阶段，有效解决了大语言模型在复杂任务中规划能力不足的问题，为深度研究代理提供了高效的规划增强方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

Conclusion: 通过时态逻辑形式化和多级验证，Sentinel为物理环境中LLM具身智能体的系统化安全评估提供了严谨基础，揭示了传统方法遗漏的安全问题。

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于微调大语言模型的框架，用于从交通事故文本叙述中自动推断驾驶员危险行为，提高DHA分类的有效性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两车碰撞占道路事故的70%，但手动编码DHA数据存在不一致性和劳动密集型问题，需要自动化解决方案来提高数据可靠性。

Method: 使用MTCF五年两车碰撞数据，在详细事故叙述上微调Llama 3.2 1B模型，并与随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost和神经网络等传统机器学习分类器进行基准比较。

Result: 微调后的LLM达到80%的整体准确率，优于所有基线模型，在数据不平衡场景中表现尤为突出。概率推理分析揭示了不同驾驶场景下的行为模式变化。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模自动化DHA检测提供了稳健且可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预提供了新机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列分析依赖静态基准，难以适应现实世界中政策变化、人类行为调整和意外事件等动态环境。LLMs提供了整合多模态输入的新机会，但现有方法大多忽视其深层推理潜力。

Method: 将时间序列分析重新定义为推理任务，利用LLMs的因果推理和解释能力，而非仅用于数值回归，强调透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Result: 通过将LLMs作为推理工具，时间序列分析能够更接近人类对齐的理解，在复杂现实环境中提供透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Conclusion: 时间序列分析应转向利用LLMs的推理能力，优先考虑因果结构和可解释性，以实现对现实世界复杂动态的更深入理解。

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出了基于偏好的奖励修复（PBRR）框架，通过从人类偏好中学习加性的、状态转移相关的修正项来自动修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，解决了奖励函数错配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的奖励函数经常与人类真实目标不匹配，导致策略错位；而从头学习奖励函数需要大量人类偏好数据，成本高昂。

Method: PBRR框架使用目标探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，学习一个加性的、状态转移相关的修正项来修复代理奖励函数。

Result: 在表格化领域，PBRR的累积遗憾与现有偏好强化学习方法相当；在奖励黑客基准测试中，PBRR始终优于从头学习奖励函数或使用其他方法修改代理奖励函数的基线方法，且需要更少的偏好数据。

Conclusion: PBRR能够有效修复错配的代理奖励函数，以更少的人类偏好数据学习高性能策略，解决了奖励函数错配和偏好数据成本高的问题。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

Method: 构建了包含欲望生成和目标管理的情感认知框架，在专有多智能体交互环境中实现该框架，模拟完整的决策过程。

Conclusion: 该情感认知框架成功实现了LLM智能体与人类的情感对齐，提升了智能体在复杂社会系统中的行为真实性和生态有效性。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的深度推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但对所有问题都使用深度推理计算成本过高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用互补代理系统：小型LLM生成初始答案，大型LLM进行验证，如正确则直接采用，否则大型LLM进行深度推理。

Result: 实验结果显示，对于简单问题，大型LLM的计算成本降低超过50%，准确率损失可忽略，同时在复杂任务上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了计算效率和性能，为LLM应用提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 当前AI代理无法在测试时动态学习复杂技能，限制了实际应用价值。需要系统性地衡量和推动这一挑战的进展。

Method: 引入J-TTL基准测试，要求代理在连续多轮游戏中提升表现。提出EvoTest框架，包含执行游戏的Actor Agent和分析游戏记录以改进配置的Evolver Agent。

Result: EvoTest在J-TTL基准上持续提升性能，优于反射、记忆和在线微调等方法，是唯一能赢得两个游戏的方法。

Conclusion: EvoTest证明了进化测试时学习框架的有效性，为AI代理在测试时学习复杂技能提供了可行方案。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

Method: SAJA框架包含两个阶段：状态攻击阶段使用多步梯度上升方法计算对抗状态；动作攻击阶段基于扰动状态使用梯度上升方法生成最终对抗动作。添加启发式正则化器增强critic网络的指导效果。

Result: 在MPE环境中验证，SAJA比仅状态攻击或仅动作攻击效果更好且更隐蔽，现有防御方法无法抵御其攻击。

Conclusion: SAJA框架通过协同攻击状态和动作，显著提升了攻击效果，证明了联合攻击的重要性，现有防御方法需要改进以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

Motivation: 生成式AI在金融服务行业的应用面临性能评估障碍，传统机器学习指标无法很好适应GenAI工作负载，而行业基准又难以泛化到工业应用。

Method: 开发了一个风险评估框架，结合领域专家评估和机器学习指标，以更好地应对选择特定指标时的独特风险。

Conclusion: 提出的风险评估框架为金融服务行业中的生成式AI性能评估提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As Generative Artificial Intelligence is adopted across the financial
services industry, a significant barrier to adoption and usage is measuring
model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to
generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter
Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to
account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs
and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper
explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for
better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

TL;DR: 提出串联训练方法，通过随机切换强弱模型来确保强模型的解决方案对弱模型可理解，同时保持任务准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型快速发展，其推理过程可能超出较弱代理和人类的理解范围，影响可解释性和监督。需要开发方法使强模型产生的解决方案对较弱合作者保持可理解性

Method: 引入串联训练：在强化学习中，随机从冻结的弱模型而非正在训练的强模型中采样token。只有当强模型的动作和推理过程能被弱模型继续时，才能成功完成rollout

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理任务中，串联训练可靠地教会模型放弃专业术语，适应较弱合作伙伴的语言，同时保持高任务准确率

Conclusion: 串联训练为构建可由较弱代理审计的AI系统提供了一条有前景的路径，对人与AI协作和多智能体通信具有重要意义

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

Abstract: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine
learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the
outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大化人类赋权（empowerment）的辅助语言模型调优方法Empower，仅需离线文本数据即可训练，无需额外人工反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辅助代理方法往往鼓励代理独立完成任务而非真正辅助人类，且需要昂贵的人工反馈。

Method: 基于最大化人类赋权（影响环境的能力）的自监督方法，仅使用离线文本数据进行微调。

Result: 用户研究中78%的参与者偏好Empower助手，接受率提高31%，建议减少38%；在编程环境中，模拟程序员成功率比基线提高192%。

Conclusion: Empower提供了一种仅使用离线数据、无需额外人工反馈的可扩展对齐AI代理框架。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

Conclusion: 控制理论护栏为当前标记-阻止护栏提供了原则性的动态替代方案，能够可靠地引导LLM代理避开灾难性结果。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

Method: 构建了Hard2Verify基准，包含500多小时人工标注的步骤级验证数据，评估了29个生成式批评器和过程奖励模型在挑战性数学问题上的表现。

Result: 除了少数突出模型外，开源验证器在步骤级验证任务上显著落后于闭源模型，验证器计算规模对性能有重要影响。

Conclusion: 步骤级验证是数学推理系统的关键组件，需要进一步研究验证器性能提升、自验证能力以及验证与生成之间的动态关系。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出LT-Gate脉冲神经元模型，结合双时间尺度动态和自适应门控机制，解决SNN在持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境，在时序分类任务中显著提升准确率和记忆保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在神经形态硬件上具有能效优势，但在需要快速适应和长期记忆的持续学习任务中表现不佳，特别是面临稳定性-可塑性困境。

Method: LT-Gate模型让每个脉冲神经元并行跟踪快慢两个时间尺度的信息，通过学习的门控机制局部调整其影响，并结合方差跟踪正则化稳定放电活动。

Result: 在时序分类基准测试中达到约51%的最终准确率，优于Hebbian持续学习基线的约46%和先前的SNN方法，且无需外部重放或昂贵正交化。

Conclusion: 多时间尺度门控能显著增强SNN的持续学习能力，缩小脉冲网络与传统深度网络在终身学习任务上的差距，并兼容神经形态硬件。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间序列大语言模型中的伪对齐问题，提出了TimeSUP方法来缓解该问题并提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪对齐是时间序列大语言模型中的普遍挑战，导致模型性能不如线性模型或随机初始化骨干网络，但社区对此问题的原因讨论有限。

Method: 通过分析伪对齐与LLM中锥效应的关联，提出了TimeSUP技术，通过增加时间序列流形维度使其更接近语言嵌入的内在维度，同时保持模态间的共享结构。

Result: TimeSUP在长期预测性能上持续优于最先进的LLM4TS方法和其他轻量级基线，并能无缝集成到四个现有LLM4TS流程中，显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 伪对齐源于预训练LLM组件中的锥效应与时间序列数据内在低维流形的相互作用，TimeSUP通过调整流形维度有效缓解了这一问题。

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习环境中类增量学习的挑战，包括任务特定知识的捕获、模型不确定性的量化、统计异质性处理以及隐私保护需求。

Method: 客户端使用Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder(CATE)生成高斯分布的任务嵌入，服务器端使用2-Wasserstein距离测量任务间差距并制定Wasserstein损失来增强任务分离。

Result: 在多个流行数据集上的实验表明，FedGTEA实现了优越的分类性能，显著减轻了遗忘问题，并持续优于现有强基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGTEA通过概率化任务嵌入和对齐方法，为联邦类增量学习提供了一个可扩展、通信高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

Motivation: 利用物理系统自然执行能量下降的特性来加速机器学习，特别是将振荡器伊辛机的GHz频率动力学与能量基模型优化和梯度下降联系起来，同时利用固有噪声支持采样和优化。

Method: 在振荡器伊辛机上实现平衡传播算法，将优化和学习过程统一到单一总能量景观的下降中，使用局部学习规则而无需全局反向传播。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到97.2±0.1%的准确率，在Fashion-MNIST数据集上达到88.0±0.1%的准确率，同时在参数量化和相位噪声等实际硬件约束下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 振荡器伊辛机为神经形态学习提供了快速、节能的硬件平台，表明能量基模型可以在直接执行其优化的物理硬件上实现实际应用。

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文开发了在状态对抗马尔可夫决策过程中剪枝认证鲁棒性的首个理论框架，证明元素级剪枝只能收紧鲁棒性边界，并通过实验发现剪枝能在适度稀疏水平下显著提升鲁棒性而不损害甚至增强干净性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的强化学习策略需要在对抗扰动下保持可靠，而现代深度强化学习代理存在过度参数化问题，增加了成本和脆弱性担忧。虽然剪枝在监督学习中已被证明能提高鲁棒性，但其在对抗强化学习中的作用尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 开发了在状态对抗马尔可夫决策过程中的剪枝认证鲁棒性理论框架，针对高斯和分类策略的Lipschitz网络，证明元素级剪枝能收紧鲁棒性边界。提出三阶段遗憾分解方法，并实证评估幅度剪枝和微剪枝调度在连续控制基准上的表现。

Result: 实验表明，剪枝在所有任务中都能在适度稀疏水平下发现可复现的"甜蜜点"，在这些点上鲁棒性显著提升，同时不损害甚至有时能增强干净性能。

Conclusion: 剪枝不仅是压缩工具，更是实现鲁棒强化学习的结构性干预手段，揭示了性能与鲁棒性之间的基本权衡边界。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

Conclusion: 该工作为评估医疗AI模型中的隐私风险提供了系统框架，有助于识别和管理基础模型可能带来的患者隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health
records (EHRs) hold promise for clinical applications. However, their capacity
to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this
work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess
privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured
EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the
embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model
generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We
contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准数据集如MNIST往往无法暴露潜在偏见和多模态特征复杂性，限制了深度神经网络在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 统一了注意力增强特征融合、基于Grad-CAM++的局部解释和用于偏见检测与缓解的揭示-修正反馈循环。

Result: 在MNIST多模态扩展上达到93.2%分类准确率、91.6% F1分数和78.1%解释保真度，优于单模态和非可解释基线。

Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent
biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of
deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal
Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion,
Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for
bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our
approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1%
explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable
baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with
bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges
the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a
practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.

*Athyrson Machado Ribeiro,Marcos Medeiros Raimundo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的置信内点外推框架(CI-EX)，通过迭代识别被拒绝客户样本分布并基于监督分类模型概率为最接近接受人群分布的拒绝个体分配标签，以解决信用评分中的样本偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝推断方法假设被拒绝客户的行为可以从接受客户中推断，但忽略了两个人群之间可能存在的分布差异，导致盲目外推。

Method: CI-EX框架使用异常检测模型迭代识别被拒绝客户样本分布，基于监督分类模型的概率为最接近接受人群分布的拒绝个体分配标签。

Result: 在两个大型真实世界信用数据集上的实验表明，CI-EX在拒绝推断特定指标上始终优于现有方法，同时在AUC指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 拒绝推断方法通常需要在AUC和拒绝推断特定指标之间进行权衡，但CI-EX框架在拒绝推断特定指标上表现优异，同时保持AUC竞争力。

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

*Eric Yeats,Aaron Jacobson,Darryl Hannan,Yiran Jia,Timothy Doster,Henry Kvinge,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用去噪分数匹配损失作为局部内在维度(LID)估计器，该方法比现有方法更高效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LID估计方法需要多次前向传播或梯度计算，在计算和内存受限场景下适用性有限。

Method: 通过理论分析证明LID是去噪分数匹配损失的下界，从而将该损失作为LID估计器，并与隐式分数匹配损失和FLIPD方法建立联系。

Result: 在流形基准测试和Stable Diffusion 3.5上的实验表明，该方法在精度和内存占用方面表现优异，特别是在问题规模和量化级别增加时。

Conclusion: 去噪分数匹配损失是一种具有竞争力的可扩展LID估计器，适用于高维复杂数据的LID量化。

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

*Sungjun Cho,Dasol Hwang,Frederic Sala,Sangheum Hwang,Kyunghyun Cho,Sungmin Cha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出FADE指标，通过比较未学习模型与参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来评估分布相似性，解决了现有遗忘指标依赖特定参考的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型的遗忘评估指标基于参考响应或分类器输出，而非核心目标：评估遗忘模型是否与从未见过不需要数据的模型行为无法区分。这种特定参考方法存在系统性盲点。

Method: 提出FADE指标，测量未学习模型与参考模型之间的分布相似性，通过比较生成样本上的双向似然分配来捕获整个输出分布的功能对齐。

Result: 在TOFU和UnlearnCanvas基准测试中，传统指标接近最优的方法未能实现分布等价，许多方法在遗忘后反而与黄金标准更加疏远。

Conclusion: FADE为开发和评估真正有效的遗忘方法提供了更稳健的基础，揭示了当前评估实践的根本性缺陷。

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

TL;DR: CSI-4CAST是一种混合深度学习架构，通过整合CNN残差、自适应校正层、ShuffleNet块和Transformer，有效捕获CSI预测中的局部和长程依赖关系，在计算效率和预测精度上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在CSI预测中存在对非高斯噪声鲁棒性不足、跨信道条件泛化能力有限以及计算效率低的问题，需要开发更稳健高效的预测方法。

Method: 提出CSI-4CAST混合架构，集成四个关键组件：卷积神经网络残差、自适应校正层、ShuffleNet块和Transformer，以高效捕获CSI预测中的局部和长程依赖关系。

Result: CSI-4CAST在88.9%的TDD场景和43.8%的FDD场景中优于基线模型，计算量比最强基线LLM4CP减少5倍和3倍，同时建立了包含30万样本的CSI-RRG基准数据集。

Conclusion: CSI-4CAST在CSI预测中实现了优异的精度和计算效率，建立的CSI-RRG基准为深度学习模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力评估提供了标准化平台。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

*Binxin Gao,Jingjun Han*

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ExtremBench基准数据集，用于评估LLM在数学极值问题求解中的推理能力，发现现有数学基准不能全面评估数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM推理能力的来源和机制，特别是优化推理能力，这对规划、控制、资源分配等关键应用至关重要。

Method: 构建ExtremBench基准数据集，包含93个标准化的极值求解问题，基于中国数学奥林匹克竞赛的不等式练习，并对多个开源模型家族进行广泛评估。

Result: 发现LLM的极值求解推理能力与当前数学基准（如AIME25和MATH-500）的评估结果不一致，有些模型在一般数学推理上表现良好但在极值求解上较差，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 现有基准可能无法全面捕捉数学推理能力的全谱系，突显了当前评估实践中的关键差距。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刚性系统的时间积分是燃烧、高超声速等反应输运系统中的主要计算成本来源，需要开发能够缓解刚性挑战的策略。

Method: 开发了AMORE框架，包含多输出预测算子和自适应损失函数；设计了自动满足单位分解的trunk网络；提出了可逆分析映射来处理质量分数约束；采用两步训练方法。

Conclusion: AMORE是一个通用框架，提出的DeepONet将成为未来CFD研究中加速湍流燃烧模拟的基础。

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

Result: 该初始化方法在单细胞RNA测序(scRNA-seq)和单细胞ATAC测序(scATAC-seq)扰动分析中显著改善了泛化性能

Conclusion: 提出的多阶段强化学习方法通过精心设计的初始化策略，有效解决了单细胞扰动建模中的局部最优问题，为细胞命运决策预测提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

Result: 该集成框架为真实数据上的自动化焊接检测提供了端到端解决方案，能够处理具有不同噪声分布的实际测量数据。

Conclusion: 提出的工作流成功解决了超声波焊接检测中的数据稀缺和信号干扰问题，实现了在工业环境中的可靠自动化检测。

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

<details>

Motivation: Koopman算子的无限维特性使得寻找合适的有限维子空间具有挑战性，特别是对于深度架构。这些困难源于次优的表示学习，其中潜在变量未能平衡表达能力和简单性。

Method: 提出基于信息论拉格朗日公式的新算法，利用潜在互信息促进简单性，冯·诺依曼熵维持表达能力，防止模式崩溃。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为Koopman学习提供了新思路，平衡简单性和表达能力的拉格朗日公式能够产生稳定且可解释的表示。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing
communication between modeling communities.

Abstract: Based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper introduces two
optimizers, named Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) as well
as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages
second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during
training, assuming relevancy in gradients between iterations. To avoid
over-fitting, NRSGD incorporates a noise regularization technique that
introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process.
Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks)
with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results
demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD,

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions
skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model
generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for
real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google
Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in
forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations
into weather forecasting.

Motivation: 传统优化理论处理固定目标函数，但动态环境中的决策需要时变优化方法。本文旨在通过时变优化视角研究流数据学习问题。

Method: 引入基于权重的结构化公式，分别研究均匀权重（平等对待所有样本）和折扣权重（几何衰减旧数据影响）两种策略，在梯度下降更新下分析跟踪误差。

Result: 均匀权重下跟踪误差以O(1/t)速率渐近消失，折扣权重会产生非零误差下限，受折扣因子和每时间步梯度更新次数控制。

Conclusion: 不同权重策略在流数据学习中有不同的跟踪误差特性，理论结果通过数值模拟得到验证。

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

TL;DR: 提出新的绝对聚类指数来评估聚类的紧凑性和分离性，通过定义每个簇的紧凑性函数和簇对之间的相邻点集来确定真实的簇数量。

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上验证了新指数的性能，并与广泛使用的聚类有效性指数进行了比较。

Conclusion: 提出的紧凑性和分离性指数能够有效识别真实的簇数量，在聚类质量评估方面表现出色。

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

Motivation: 现有脑电基础模型的信号标记化模块无法保留高频动态，限制了脑电信号的高保真重建能力，影响了表示学习的性能。

Method: 使用多尺度特征提取模块捕捉全频段神经频谱，采用分层残差向量量化码本进行高分辨率编码，并设计脑电信号相位和幅度感知损失函数进行高效训练。

Result: NeuroRVQ实现了更低的重建误差，在各种下游任务中优于现有的大规模脑电模型。

Conclusion: NeuroRVQ标记器为基于码本的通用脑电模型建立了强大的先验，推动了神经解码、生成建模和多模态生物信号集成的发展。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于大规模MU-MISO信道下行波束成形的无监督深度学习框架，采用Transformer架构，结合课程学习、半摊销学习和滑动窗口训练策略，在低中SNR下优于现有基线，在高SNR下接近WMMSE性能，推理速度显著快于迭代和在线学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模多用户MISO系统中，传统波束成形优化方法计算复杂，难以满足实时通信需求。需要开发能够离线训练、实时推理的高效深度学习解决方案。

Method: 基于学习优化范式，使用多层Transformer通过残差连接迭代优化信道和波束成形器特征。引入三种训练策略：课程学习改善收敛性、半摊销学习通过梯度上升细化Transformer块、滑动窗口训练稳定优化过程。

Result: 仿真结果显示，在低到中SNR下优于现有基线方法，在高SNR下性能接近WMMSE算法，同时推理速度比迭代和在线学习方法快得多。

Conclusion: 该无监督深度学习框架为大规模MU-MISO系统提供了一种高效的下行波束成形解决方案，实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

TL;DR: DeepCausalMMM是一个结合深度学习、因果推断和营销科学的Python包，用于改进传统营销组合建模，能自动学习时间模式和渠道间因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统营销组合建模方法依赖线性回归或贝叶斯分层模型，假设营销渠道间独立，难以捕捉复杂的时间动态和非线性饱和效应。

Method: 使用门控循环单元(GRU)自动学习时间模式(如广告存量和滞后效应)，通过有向无环图(DAG)学习营销渠道间的统计依赖关系和潜在因果结构，并基于Hill方程实现饱和曲线建模。

Result: 实现了数据驱动设计、多区域建模、鲁棒统计方法、全面的响应曲线分析和14+交互式可视化仪表板等关键创新功能。

Conclusion: DeepCausalMMM通过结合深度学习、因果推断和先进营销科学，成功解决了传统营销组合建模的局限性，为营销预算优化提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the
impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or
customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or
Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing
channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear
saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

Conclusion: 提出的稀疏三角传输映射框架在保持表达性和可逆结构的同时，实现了线性时间复杂度和站点并行评估，为大规模晶格场理论采样提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

Result: MDMs与多项式填充PLTs等价，能解决所有CoT变换器能解决的问题，且在某些问题（如正则语言）上比CoT变换器更高效。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散模型在并行生成方面具有理论优势，能够高效解决某些推理问题，为文本生成模型提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

Conclusion: CoDa-FL框架通过集群化客户端选择和依赖感知任务调度，有效提升了联邦学习在移动边缘计算环境中的性能表现。

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within
mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent
multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various
learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware
framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower
communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under
heterogeneous MEC settings.

Method: 使用随机批次方法构建无偏估计器，在时间区间上采样神经元批次，分析轨迹收敛性和分布稳定性，并进行伴随分析。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了连续时间dropout的理论基础，展示了良好的正则化效果和计算效率，为深度学习的连续时间模型提供了新的正则化视角。

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解跨模态知识蒸馏提供了新的理论框架，并基于CCH准则提供了选择最优教师模态的实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We
theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it
empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video,
audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical
framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines
based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving
the performance of weaker modalities.

Motivation: 医疗欺诈检测面临标注数据稀缺、欺诈手段不断演变和医疗记录高维度的挑战。传统监督方法受限于极端标签稀缺，而纯无监督方法往往无法捕捉临床意义上的异常。

Method: 通过联合训练编码器在代表合规和违规的合成数据上，学习软规则嵌入，将领域知识约束与数据驱动学习相结合。

Conclusion: 将专家规则嵌入学习过程不仅能提高检测准确性，还能增加透明度，为医疗欺诈检测等高风险领域提供可解释的方法。

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

TL;DR: 比较Ising({-1,+1})和QUBO({0,1})编码在玻尔兹曼机学习中的差异，发现QUBO编码导致Fisher信息矩阵条件数更差，使得随机梯度下降收敛更慢，而自然梯度下降对编码选择不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同变量编码（Ising vs QUBO）如何影响玻尔兹曼机的学习动态和信息几何特性，为实际训练提供编码选择指导。

Method: 在控制模型、采样器和步长的条件下，比较两种编码的Fisher信息矩阵特性，分析其谱特性和对梯度下降算法收敛速度的影响。

Result: QUBO编码产生更大的交叉项，导致Fisher信息矩阵有更多小特征值方向，谱熵更低，使得随机梯度下降收敛更慢；自然梯度下降对编码选择不敏感。

Conclusion: 对于基于SGD的训练，Ising编码提供更各向同性的曲率和更快收敛；对于QUBO编码，中心化/缩放或NGD式预处理可以缓解曲率问题。

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

Motivation: 现有研究通常使用外部奖励模型或现成LLM预处理原始训练数据集来识别有价值的偏好对，但很少检查单个数据点是否真正有益。

Method: 使用新提出的截断影响函数(TIF)评估数据质量，并开发两种计算更简单的评分函数，通过组合它们来抵消不同的误差源。

Conclusion: 偏好数据质量是模型相关的，需要针对特定模型改进数据选择方法，提出的数据选择规则能够更精确地选择有价值的偏好数据。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

TL;DR: FracNet是一种基于频谱分析的图神经网络，通过分离高低频组件进行频率感知的领域自适应，结合对比学习解决领域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在领域适应中表现不佳，主要原因是未能区分处理全局和局部模式，且对可迁移模式探索不足。通过频谱分析发现低频编码领域不变全局模式，高频捕获领域特定局部细节。

Method: 提出FracNet，包含两个协同模块：将原始图分解为高低频组件，进行频率感知领域适应；结合对比学习框架改善领域适应边界模糊问题。

Result: 大量实验证明FracNet相比最先进方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: FracNet通过频谱分解和对比学习有效解决了图神经网络的领域适应问题，并提供了严格的理论证明。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: MERA是一个通过选择性干预来减少语言模型错误的框架，能够优化干预方向和校准干预时机与强度，避免过度或不足干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定、手动调整的干预强度，容易导致干预不足或过度，需要更智能的干预策略。

Method: 通过优化干预方向和校准干预时机与强度，在无法自信修正时选择弃权，可证明地提升性能。

Result: 在多个数据集和语言模型家族上的实验表明，MERA能够安全有效地纠正错误且不降低性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MERA可作为通用高效的机制激活引导方法，并可应用于现有引导技术之上进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

TL;DR: BlendFL是一个新颖的联邦学习框架，通过融合横向和纵向联邦学习的原理，有效处理现实世界中的多模态数据异构性问题，支持客户端根据可用数据集灵活选择训练方式，并采用去中心化推理机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中多模态数据异构性挑战，传统联邦学习框架在理想假设下有效，但无法处理客户端间模态和样本分布不均的情况。

Method: 提出BlendFL框架，同步融合横向和纵向联邦学习，支持客户端根据数据可用性灵活选择训练方式；引入去中心化推理机制；开发BlendAvg自适应全局模型聚合策略。

Result: 在三个分类任务上的实验表明，BlendFL在多模态和单模态分类中均优于现有方法，消融研究显示其收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: BlendFL在处理多模态数据异构性方面具有巨大潜力，特别适用于医疗和金融等需要数据隐私保护的现实场景。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型非结构化离散空间中，由于缺乏梯度，贝叶斯优化的获取函数最大化计算成本高昂。

Method: 基于Thompson采样，通过直接参数化候选者产生最大奖励的概率，利用提示条件大型语言模型的先验知识，并逐步调整它们朝向后验分布。

Result: 在FAQ响应优化、热稳定蛋白质搜索和量子电路设计三个任务上验证了方法，在线微调显著提高了样本效率，对计算效率影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ToSFiT方法通过变分Thompson采样实现了与标准方法相当的强保证，证明了仔细适应后验最大概率原则的重要性。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Fed-CCP方法，通过生成模型实现联邦学习中的条件保形预测，解决客户端数据分布差异问题，提供更自适应的预测集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准保形预测假设数据独立同分布，但在联邦学习场景中客户端数据分布差异很大，现有联邦CP方法只能保证边际覆盖，无法反映输入条件不确定性。

Method: 使用生成模型（如归一化流或扩散模型）近似条件数据分布，无需共享原始数据，让每个客户端本地校准反映其独特不确定性的保形分数，通过联邦聚合保持全局一致性。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，Fed-CCP能够实现更自适应的预测集。

Conclusion: Fed-CCP通过生成模型有效解决了联邦学习中数据异构性问题，提供了更好的条件覆盖保证。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty
quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the
true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated
learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

TL;DR: 提出了Generalist框架，通过将整体泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个子任务由专门的基学习器处理，然后通过参数插值形成全局学习器，有效缓解了对抗训练中自然精度下降和跨攻击鲁棒性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练虽然是最有效的防御方法，但在实际应用中存在两个主要限制：自然精度显著下降，以及在不同范数约束下攻击间的鲁棒性迁移性差。

Method: 将整体泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个子任务分配给专门的基学习器。在训练后期，通过插值基学习器的参数形成全局学习器，并定期将全局参数重新分配给基学习器以防止优化轨迹偏离共享目标。

Result: 理论分析和大量实验表明，Generalist实现了更低的泛化误差，并显著缓解了与基线方法相比的权衡问题。

Conclusion: Generalist为未来开发完全鲁棒的分类器提供了一个有前景的步骤。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

Motivation: 生成扩散模型在气象降尺度任务中虽然具有重建保真度和可扩展采样能力，但缺乏有限样本保证，导致预测过于自信和不确定性估计校准不良，影响其在业务应用中的可靠性。

Method: 通过将扩散模型的样本进行后处理，推导条件分位数估计，并将其纳入保形化分位数回归过程，目标是获得具有有限样本边际有效性的局部自适应预测区间。

Conclusion: 保形化生成模型在实现更可信的高分辨率气象场概率降尺度方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

Result: 在22个真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ISER优于11种基线方法。

Conclusion: ISER通过超球体半径编码密度信息，有效解决了现有异常检测方法的局限性，并在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

Conclusion: 这些发现为在在线强化学习中应用transformer提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical
guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

Conclusion: 分布式机器学习、分布式计算和通信的紧密集成首次实现了在超低功耗硬件上以最先进精度进行训练。

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault
or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that
CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate
RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks
from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network
microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture
reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when
scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight
integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication
enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Motivation: 高层建筑会导致GPS点偏离停车位实际位置，且低成本GPS设备本身存在定位误差，需要从大量停车位中无监督地校正少数错误的GPS点。

Result: 广泛实验证明该方法在解决实际问题方面的优越性，能够有效处理任何类型的GPS点误差。

Conclusion: 该方法简单而有效，为停车管理、停车政策和城市发展等应用提供了准确的GPS点数据。

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

<details>

Motivation: 算法决策日益普及但易受战略性操纵，现有研究表明分类器弃权可提高准确性，本文旨在探索弃权在战略性分类环境中的作用。

Method: 采用Stackelberg博弈模型，决策者首先宣布决策策略，战略性代理随后操纵特征以获得期望结果，关注二元分类器中代理操纵可观察特征的情况。

Result: 最优弃权确保决策者效用不劣于无弃权设置，弃权还能作为操纵威慑，使资格较差的代理操纵成本更高。

Conclusion: 弃权是减少算法决策系统中战略性行为负面影响的有价值工具，既能提高准确性又能威慑操纵。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

Result: 在200多个基准数据集上验证，相比最先进求解器实现100倍以上加速，能够解决竞争方法失败的实例。

Conclusion: 该方法为SOS编程的实际可扩展性提供了新的见解，有望改变其实际应用规模。

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: 传统方法要么丢弃不完整数据，要么进行插补预处理，导致信息丢失和相似性估计偏差。需要一种能直接处理不完整数据的相似性度量方法。

Method: 使用数据依赖分箱结合邻近分配将数据投影到高维稀疏表示中，适应局部密度变化。采用级联回退策略估计缺失特征分布。

Result: 在12个真实世界不完整数据集上进行聚类任务，相比现有方法表现出更优性能，同时保持线性时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 邻近核方法能够有效处理不完整数据，在保持计算效率的同时提供准确的相似性度量。

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了在局部差分隐私模型下，基于KL正则化的人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）的离线和在线设置。在离线设置中，提出了悲观算法并获得最优的次优性差距；在在线设置中，首次理论研究了带隐私保护的KL正则化RLHF问题，设计了乐观算法并获得对数遗憾界。


<details>

Motivation: 研究在保护人类偏好标签隐私（ε-局部差分隐私）的前提下，如何有效进行KL正则化的强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF），这是大语言模型对齐中广泛使用的目标函数。

Method: 离线设置：基于悲观原则设计算法；在线设置：基于乐观原则设计算法，并分析其遗憾界。两种方法都在ε-局部差分隐私模型下保护人类偏好标签。

Result: 离线设置：获得次优性差距为Õ(1/[(e^ε-1)^2 n])，并证明其最优性；在线设置：获得对数遗憾界O(d_F log(N_F·T)/(e^ε-1)^2)，其中T是总时间步数，N_F是奖励函数空间基数，d_F是RLHF的eluder维度变体。

Conclusion: 本文首次在隐私保护框架下系统分析了KL正则化RLHF问题，为离线设置提供了最优算法，为在线设置提供了首个理论分析，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动设备上大语言模型部署时，LoRA适配器增量交付带来的在线持续合并挑战，需要在存储限制下保持先前任务性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决设备上LoRA适配器的在线持续合并问题，在资源受限环境下保持良好性能。

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

Motivation: 解决云服务环境中复杂依赖关系和多样化异常模式的挑战，传统方法难以有效处理这些复杂场景。

Method: 将服务交互抽象为依赖图，通过嵌入函数提取时空和结构特征，使用图卷积机制聚合邻域信息，引入对比学习框架构建正负样本对，并设计时间一致性约束来保持表示稳定性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在精确率、召回率、F1分数和AUC等关键指标上显著优于现有方法，在稀疏标注、监控噪声和流量波动条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 验证了依赖建模与对比学习结合的有效性，为云服务异常检测提供了完整技术方案，在复杂环境中表现出强大的适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

Motivation: 虽然数据可用性和准确预测需求都在增长，但利益相关者之间的协作常受数据所有权和竞争利益限制。现有合作博弈框架存在局限性，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: 采用预测市场框架，使用稳健回归模型学习最优预测组合并处理缺失提交，引入考虑样本内外表现的收益分配机制，满足多项经济特性。

Result: 通过模拟和真实数据案例研究，证明了所提出市场设计的有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该预测市场设计能够有效促进利益相关者之间的协作，同时处理数据所有权和竞争利益问题，具有良好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

Motivation: 现有GNN架构在表达能力上受限，而更强大的架构通常计算成本高昂。需要开发既具强表达能力又保持高效性的GNN架构。

Method: 基于Chiba和Nishizeki的经典三角形计数算法，提出EB-1WL测试和EB-GNN架构，在消息传递过程中显式利用三角形结构。

Result: EB-1WL比1-WL表达能力显著更强，EB-GNN在保持接近线性复杂度的情况下，性能大幅优于简单MPNN，与任务专用GNN竞争且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: EB-GNN是一个高效通用的GNN架构，在强表达能力和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡，为实际图学习任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding
GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle
counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during
message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly
more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient
general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and
remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more
computationally efficient.

*Benjamin Kempinski,Tal Kachman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的方法来近似计算网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值，相比传统精确计算和蒙特卡洛采样方法，实现了数量级的加速和零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值计算在多智能体系统中至关重要，但精确计算在超过约20个代理时变得不可行，而蒙特卡洛方法样本复杂度高且无法跨网络配置迁移知识。

Method: 将问题构建为图级预测任务，使用图神经网络（GAT、GINE、EdgeConv）直接从网络拓扑和控制结构中学习代理影响力的通用模式。

Result: 在包含200,000个图的大规模合成数据集上，训练后的GNN模型实现了高保真度的Banzhaf值近似，相比精确和基于采样的方法有数量级的速度提升，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了GNN作为复杂网络系统可扩展合作博弈论分析的实用工具，能够准确预测具有不同结构特性的新网络的Banzhaf值，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型的发展，其零样本预测能力需要可靠评估，但现有评估方法存在数据完整性、信息泄露和基准混淆等问题，可能导致性能估计虚高。

Method: 通过调查现有TSFM评估实践，识别出数据集代表性、时空评估缺失、信息泄露风险和外部冲击影响等关键问题。

Result: 研究发现现有评估存在广泛的数据划分混淆，可能导致性能估计虚高，以及将全局知识错误转移到局部时间序列的问题。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区开发稳健的评估方法，包括使用真正样本外未来数据进行评估，以保障TSFM评估的完整性，避免重蹈LLM和经典时间序列基准测试的覆辙。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

TL;DR: 提出一个假设宽松的框架来评估生存分析中条件平均治疗效应(CATE)估计在面临删失偏差时的稳健性，使用部分识别方法推导CATE的信息边界，并开发了一个新的元学习器来估计这些边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床研究中高达一半的患者因副作用或其他原因提前退出，当退出是信息性的（即依赖于生存时间）时，会引入删失偏差，导致治疗效应估计也产生偏差。

Method: 使用部分识别方法推导CATE的信息边界，开发了一个新的元学习器，该元学习器可以使用任意机器学习模型估计边界，并具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率等有利的理论性质。

Result: 通过数值实验和癌症药物试验应用证明了元学习器的实际价值，能够识别在信息性删失下治疗仍然有效的患者亚组。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个实用工具，用于在存在删失的情况下评估估计治疗效应的稳健性，从而促进在医学和流行病学中可靠地使用生存数据进行证据生成。

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

Method: 基于参数共享结构(如Deep Sets和图神经网络)设计轴向神经网络(XNN)，将现有PDE基础模型转换为XNN架构，支持跨维度泛化。

Result: XNN在三种训练场景下(从头训练、多PDE预训练、单PDE微调)表现与原模型相当，且在未见维度上展现出更优的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多维预训练对基础模型至关重要，XNN架构为处理变维度物理数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

Conclusion: 该方法在恶劣能见度条件下显著提升了场景理解能力，在监控和自主系统应用中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized
encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and
a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR
benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real
RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion
framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural
fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal
baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of
U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight
substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and
autonomous systems.

TL;DR: AdaLog是一个轻量级自适应系统，通过消除特征级冗余数据和优化异构行为存储，显著减少移动应用中用户行为日志的存储空间，同时保持模型推理精度和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在移动应用中的普及，记录用户行为数据带来了巨大的存储成本，导致系统响应性降低和更多应用卸载。现有工业实践存在特征冗余和存储稀疏的问题。

Method: 1) 将特征级冗余数据消除建模为超图中的最大权重匹配问题，提出分层算法；2) 使用虚拟哈希属性设计将异构行为分布到少量日志文件中；3) 设计增量更新机制以适应动态用户行为模式。

Result: 在真实用户数据上的评估显示，AdaLog将行为日志大小减少了19%到44%，系统开销极小（仅2秒延迟和15MB内存使用）。

Conclusion: AdaLog为更广泛采用设备端机器学习提供了更高效的数据基础，解决了移动应用中用户行为日志存储的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device
ML.

Conclusion: 通过正交变换可以有效地使嵌入模型互操作，同时保持各自嵌入空间的几何结构，为实际应用提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用单纯形嵌入来加速强化学习训练，通过几何归纳偏置产生稀疏离散特征，在不损失运行速度的情况下提高样本效率和最终性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模环境并行化方法虽然能加速训练，但仍需要大量环境交互才能达到理想性能。结构化表示可以改善深度强化学习的泛化能力和样本效率。

Method: 提出单纯形嵌入方法，这是一种轻量级表示层，将嵌入约束在单纯形结构中，产生稀疏离散特征来稳定critic自举和增强策略梯度。

Result: 在FastTD3、FastSAC和PPO算法上应用单纯形嵌入，在多种连续和离散控制环境中一致提高了样本效率和最终性能，且运行速度没有损失。

Conclusion: 单纯形嵌入通过几何归纳偏置有效改善了强化学习算法的性能，是一种有前景的表示学习方法。

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种改进的物理信息神经网络框架，应用于肿瘤学领域，能够从稀疏的实验数据中学习肿瘤微环境中的时间变化相互作用，特别是联合治疗的动态效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在肿瘤学中，实验数据通常稀疏且仅包含少数时间点的肿瘤体积数据，传统方法难以准确建模。通过嵌入从动态系统先验信息中推导的归纳偏置，可以更好地处理这种数据稀疏问题。

Method: 扩展物理信息神经网络，将观察到的生物约束作为正则化项嵌入损失函数。该方法能够引导自身找到合理解，并在仅有少量训练样本时具有良好的泛化能力。

Result: 该方法成功学习了间歇性联合治疗在常微分方程模型中的动态过程，得到了ODE的解以及部分ODE模型参数的时间变化形式。在MSE、MAE和MAPE等指标上表现出强收敛性。

Conclusion: 改进的PINN框架能够有效处理肿瘤学中的稀疏数据问题，成功建模联合治疗的动态相互作用，为肿瘤治疗动力学研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We
demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Mamdani系统可解释性和TSK模型精度的新型模糊回归方法，通过混合规则结构和双重优势类型，在保持可解释性的同时提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归方法难以处理现实世界数据中的不确定性和模糊性，而深度学习缺乏可解释性且在小数据集上容易过拟合。模糊系统能够处理不确定性和不精确性，但Mamdani和TSK系统在可解释性和准确性之间存在权衡。

Method: 开发了一种混合模糊回归方法，结合了Mamdani系统的可解释性和TSK模型的精度。该方法引入了具有模糊和清晰组件的混合规则结构，以及双重优势类型。

Result: 在6个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法在4个数据集中获得了最佳模糊方法得分，在2个数据集中优于不透明模型，在1个数据集中获得最佳总体得分，RMSE改进范围从0.4%到19%。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法为预测建模提供了一个平衡且多功能的工具，解决了模糊系统中可解释性和准确性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统性地分析了RL在LLMs中的扩展规律，提出了可预测的扩展框架，并开发了最佳实践方法ScaleRL，使RL训练具有类似预训练的可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL在训练大语言模型中越来越重要，但缺乏像预训练那样的可预测扩展方法，无法评估算法改进对RL计算扩展的影响。

Method: 进行了超过40万GPU小时的大规模系统研究，拟合RL训练的S型计算-性能曲线，分析各种设计选择对渐近性能和计算效率的影响。

Result: 发现：(1)不同方法渐近性能不同；(2)损失聚合、归一化等细节主要影响计算效率而非渐近性能；(3)稳定可扩展的方法遵循可预测的扩展轨迹。基于此提出了ScaleRL方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为分析RL扩展提供了科学框架，并通过ScaleRL方法使RL训练接近预训练的可预测性水平。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language
models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解标准训练程序如何产生良好校准模型的理论基础，因为概率预测的校准对可靠机器学习至关重要但缺乏理论理解。

Method: 基于优化误差、正则化强度和Rademacher复杂度建立平滑校准误差的有限样本泛化界，并在再生核希尔伯特空间中实例化理论。

Result: 实验验证了理论保证，表明L2正则化ERM可以提供良好校准模型，无需提升或后处理重新校准。

Conclusion: 标准L2正则化经验风险最小化本身就具有内在的校准控制能力，为模型校准提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source
code to reproduce all experiments is available at

Motivation: 提高RL系统对抗攻击的鲁棒性，研究各种对抗攻击策略。传统确定性攻击可被受害者智能体逆转，因此需要开发不可逆的攻击方法。

Method: 采用率失真信息论方法，随机改变智能体对转移核或其他属性的观察，限制智能体获取地面真实信息。

Result: 推导了受害者智能体奖励遗憾的信息论下界，展示了率失真攻击对最先进模型基和无模型算法的影响。

Conclusion: 该信息论方法可扩展到其他类型的对抗攻击，如状态观察攻击，为RL系统安全提供了新的攻击视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.

Motivation: 平均收益最优性在MDP中过于渐近，需要结合即时损失度量来考虑偏差最优性层次结构，直至Blackwell最优性。

Method: 为每个最优性阶次构建了学习算法，并提供了可追踪的停止规则，确保在可能时在有限时间内触发停止。

Result: 确定了具有唯一Bellman最优策略的MDP类别，这类MDP的识别算法可以在有限时间内停止，且与最优性阶次无关。

Conclusion: 提出的学习算法具有渐近误差消失特性，停止规则在可能时确保有限时间停止，为偏差最优性策略识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further
incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias
optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题建模技术在医学文本上表现不佳，特别是在医疗领域某些主题文档数量较少的情况下。

Method: 使用原型网络构建主题模型，通过计算输入数据点与一组原型表示之间的距离来进行预测，特别适用于低数据或小样本学习场景。

Result: 与文献中使用的两种主题建模基线相比，ProtoTopic在主题连贯性和多样性方面表现出改进，能够生成医学相关主题。

Conclusion: ProtoTopic在数据有限的情况下能够有效生成医学相关主题，证明了原型网络在主题建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展传统在线凸优化(OCO)框架，处理多个目标函数序列的跟踪问题，其中算法需要在每个时间步选择动作，然后才能看到K个损失函数，旨在平衡跟踪不同序列的需求。

Method: 针对i.i.d.输入设置，提出结合Hedge算法和在线梯度下降(OGD)的简单算法，通过简单的证明分析其性能。

Result: 该算法在i.i.d.模型下的期望min-max遗憾为O(√(T log K))，其中T是时间范围，K是损失函数序列数量。

Conclusion: 提出的混合算法在多目标在线凸优化问题中实现了次线性的min-max遗憾，为处理多个竞争目标提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM评估中需要采用扰动感知报告和鲁棒性诊断，即使是细微的编辑也可能改变比较判断。

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

Motivation: 在先进节点中，功耗、性能和面积（PPA）优化变得复杂且困难。机器学习和设计技术协同优化面临训练数据缺乏和设计流程周期长的限制。

Method: 提出ArtNet人工网表生成器，复制关键拓扑特征，生成更匹配目标参数的逼真人工数据集，支持更广泛的设计空间探索。

Result: 在CNN基DRV预测中，ArtNet数据增强使F1分数比仅使用原始数据集提高0.16；在DTCO中，ArtNet生成的mini-brains与目标全规模块设计的PPA匹配度达97.94%。

Conclusion: ArtNet通过生成逼真的人工数据集，有效提升了机器学习模型的泛化能力和设计技术协同优化的效率，为PPA优化提供了有力支持。

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

Motivation: SEEG信号分析在脑机接口和神经科学研究中至关重要，但由于输入通道数量大且相关性异质，传统通道选择方法难以扩展或提供有意义的可解释性。

Method: EEGChaT引入通道聚合令牌(CATs)来聚合跨通道信息，并利用改进的注意力展开技术计算可解释的定量通道重要性分数。

Conclusion: EEGChaT是高维SEEG分析中有效且可泛化的通道选择解决方案，既能提升性能又能提供神经信号相关性的洞察。

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric
domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to
irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

TL;DR: 提出基于任务算术和神经正切核的创新方法，用于快速从模型中移除客户端影响，解决现有知识移除方法需要多轮通信导致模型不可用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私法规和安全要求，需要从联邦学习模型中强制移除特定客户端的贡献。现有方法需要多轮通信，导致模型在移除过程中不可用，影响系统服务。

Method: 使用任务算术和神经正切核技术，实现快速移除客户端对模型的影响。

Result: 开发了一种能够快速移除客户端影响的创新解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法满足了隐私保护要求下的高效知识移除需求，避免了模型在移除过程中的不可用问题。

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文为经典非线性降维方法构建神经解码器框架，实现双向映射并探索生成能力，但发现NLDR嵌入的离散稀疏特性不适合生成模型的连续插值需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典非线性降维技术如t-SNE、Isomap和LLE缺乏将低维嵌入映射回原始高维空间的能力，这限制了它们在生成应用中的使用。

Method: 构建神经解码器架构框架，实现双向映射，并扩展实现基于扩散的生成过程在学习的流形空间中进行。

Result: 解码器能成功重建数据，但质量不如端到端优化的自编码器；流形约束扩散产生低质量样本，表明经典NLDR嵌入的离散稀疏特性不适合生成模型。

Conclusion: 为可视化设计的经典NLDR方法难以改造生成能力，突显了在可视化工具上添加生成功能的固有挑战。

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了基于门电路的量子储层计算(MTS-QRC)用于多元时间序列预测，该方法针对当前量子硬件约束进行优化，在噪声环境中表现出色，甚至在某些情况下优于无噪声模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子储层计算大多针对单变量信号，且忽视了近期量子硬件的实际约束，需要开发适用于多元时间序列且能在NISQ硬件上运行的实用方法。

Method: 使用注入和记忆量子比特配对，采用Trotterized最近邻横向场Ising演化，针对当前设备连接性和深度进行优化。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和ENSO数据集上分别获得0.0087和0.0036的均方误差，性能与经典储层计算相当，在某些情况下优于学习型RNN。在IBM Heron R2上保持准确性，且在ENSO上甚至优于无噪声模拟器。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了基于门电路的量子储层计算在NISQ硬件上进行多元时间序列预测的实用性，并表明硬件噪声可能通过集中特征方向方差来作为线性读出的隐式正则化器。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

Conclusion: RCS方法通过分布校准策略有效缓解了类别不平衡问题，提高了分类器的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Motivation: 对角预条件器作为二阶优化器的近似方法，在深度学习训练中显示出加速潜力。Adam和Gauss-Newton是两种主要方法，需要系统比较它们在预条件基选择和梯度噪声影响下的表现。

Method: 在二次目标和逻辑回归问题下分析四种象限情况，比较Adam、GN⁻¹和GN⁻¹/²在不同基选择和批量设置下的性能。

Result: 理论分析表明：无论基选择如何，在完整批量设置下存在Adam优于GN⁻¹和GN⁻¹/²的情况；在随机设置下，对于高斯数据假设的线性回归，Adam与GN⁻¹/²表现相似。实证研究支持这些理论结果。

Conclusion: Adam和Gauss-Newton对角预条件方法在不同条件下各有优劣，预条件基选择和梯度噪声是影响性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

Conclusion: 提出的InfoRM、IBL框架和MOP指标共同推进了RLHF技术的发展，有效解决了奖励过优化问题。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

Result: 大幅减少层间剪枝误差，在GPT架构上优于强基线方法，且保持内存效率

Conclusion: 结合FW算法的收敛保证，该方法能为原始组合问题提供近似解

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide
theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence
guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the
original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to
integrality.

Motivation: 千米尺度天气数据对实际应用至关重要，但传统天气模拟计算成本高。深度学习模型提供了更快的替代方案，但其可靠性仍受质疑，因为现有评估多使用标准机器学习指标而非基于大气物理学的洞察。

Method: 对最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试，引入基于物理学的诊断方法来评估性能，特别关注地理泛化和物理一致性。提出使用功率谱密度损失函数来改进模型。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在千米尺度天气降尺度中面临地理泛化和物理一致性的挑战。提出的功率谱密度损失函数经验性地改善了地理泛化能力，但仍需进一步研究来提高物理一致性。

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for
reproducing the experimental results can be found at

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

Conclusion: TGPS通过张量分解和高效训练策略，成功解决了传统PDE求解器的可扩展性和效率问题，为大规模PDE求解提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as
cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic
monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored
compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods
often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose
fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies.
Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that
leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class
tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This
design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled
cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic
social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks.
It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and
structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining
topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph
learning.

### [214] [MiGumi: Making Tightly Coupled Integral Joints Millable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13168)
*Aditya Ganeshan,Kurt Fleischer,Wenzel Jakob,Ariel Shamir,Daniel Ritchie,Takeo Igarashi,Maria Larsson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG)的语言来表示可铣削几何形状，并通过共同优化零件几何形状来恢复传统木工接头的紧密配合，使其适用于CNC铣削工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统整体木工接头虽然坚固耐用且优雅，但由于手动制作成本高、难度大，在现代工作流程中很少使用。CNC铣削提供了可扩展的替代方案，但直接铣削传统接头往往无法产生功能性结果，因为铣削会导致几何偏差（如圆角内角），从而改变零件的目标几何形状。

Method: 1. 设计了MXG语言来表示可铣削几何形状，将每个铣削操作建模为具有工具方向和钻头半径的减法挤出体积；2. 通过表面接近度和铣刀路径约束来形式化紧密耦合，并推导出两个可微分的损失函数来优化接头几何形状。

Result: 在30个传统接头设计上评估了该方法，证明其能生产CNC兼容、紧密配合的接头，近似原始几何形状。

Conclusion: 通过重新解释传统接头以适应CNC工作流程，延续了这一传统工艺的演变，并确保其在未来制造实践中的相关性。

Abstract: Traditional integral wood joints, despite their strength, durability, and
elegance, remain rare in modern workflows due to the cost and difficulty of
manual fabrication. CNC milling offers a scalable alternative, but directly
milling traditional joints often fails to produce functional results because
milling induces geometric deviations, such as rounded inner corners, that alter
the target geometries of the parts. Since joints rely on tightly fitting
surfaces, such deviations introduce gaps or overlaps that undermine fit or
block assembly. We propose to overcome this problem by (1) designing a language
that represent millable geometry, and (2) co-optimizing part geometries to
restore coupling. We introduce Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG), a language
for representing geometry as the outcome of milling operations performed with
flat-end drill bits. MXG represents each operation as a subtractive extrusion
volume defined by a tool direction and drill radius. This parameterization
enables the modeling of artifact-free geometry under an idealized zero-radius
drill bit, matching traditional joint designs. Increasing the radius then
reveals milling-induced deviations, which compromise the integrity of the
joint. To restore coupling, we formalize tight coupling in terms of both
surface proximity and proximity constraints on the mill-bit paths associated
with mating surfaces. We then derive two tractable, differentiable losses that
enable efficient optimization of joint geometry. We evaluate our method on 30
traditional joint designs, demonstrating that it produces CNC-compatible,
tightly fitting joints that approximates the original geometry. By
reinterpreting traditional joints for CNC workflows, we continue the evolution
of this heritage craft and help ensure its relevance in future making
practices.

Conclusion: HRM²Avatar在视觉真实性和实时交互性方面优于最先进的单目方法，实现了高质量虚拟人的实时渲染。

Abstract: We present HRM$^2$Avatar, a framework for creating high-fidelity avatars from
monocular phone scans, which can be rendered and animated in real time on
mobile devices. Monocular capture with smartphones provides a low-cost
alternative to studio-grade multi-camera rigs, making avatar digitization
accessible to non-expert users. Reconstructing high-fidelity avatars from
single-view video sequences poses challenges due to limited visual and
geometric data. To address these limitations, at the data level, our method
leverages two types of data captured with smartphones: static pose sequences
for texture reconstruction and dynamic motion sequences for learning
pose-dependent deformations and lighting changes. At the representation level,
we employ a lightweight yet expressive representation to reconstruct
high-fidelity digital humans from sparse monocular data. We extract garment
meshes from monocular data to model clothing deformations effectively, and
attach illumination-aware Gaussians to the mesh surface, enabling high-fidelity
rendering and capturing pose-dependent lighting. This representation
efficiently learns high-resolution and dynamic information from monocular data,
enabling the creation of detailed avatars. At the rendering level, real-time
performance is critical for animating high-fidelity avatars in AR/VR, social
gaming, and on-device creation. Our GPU-driven rendering pipeline delivers 120
FPS on mobile devices and 90 FPS on standalone VR devices at 2K resolution,
over $2.7\times$ faster than representative mobile-engine baselines.
Experiments show that HRM$^2$Avatar delivers superior visual realism and
real-time interactivity, outperforming state-of-the-art monocular methods.
