### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，用于提升高光谱单图像超分辨率任务中的空间细节和光谱保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在高光谱超分辨率任务中难以同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围内的光谱保真度。

Method: 引入SSUF模块结合光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取，并设计空间-光谱梯度损失函数来指导基于ResNet的CNN进行重建。

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，所提出的混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数能有效提升高光谱超分辨率任务的空间和光谱重建质量。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，通过任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示幻觉源于数据分布和继承偏见的可预测模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛采用使得解决幻觉问题变得迫切，但目前对幻觉的理解仍不完整和碎片化，需要建立统一的理解框架来开发更有效的解决方案。

Method: 首先提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，然后使用任务-模态交织方法将这些幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 研究发现幻觉往往源于数据分布的可预测模式和继承的偏见，为开发更稳健的解决方案提供了基础。

Conclusion: 通过深化对幻觉的理解，本调查为在现实世界生成式AI系统中开发更稳健和有效的幻觉解决方案奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RobustVLA方法，针对VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性问题，通过输出鲁棒性优化和输入鲁棒性增强，在17种扰动下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽视了动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动，导致在真实世界部署时鲁棒性不足。

Method: 1) 输出鲁棒性：通过离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况动作噪声；2) 输入鲁棒性：强制输入变化时保持动作一致性；3) 多臂老虎机框架自动识别最有害噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，RobustVLA相比基线在17种扰动下分别获得12.6%和10.4%的绝对提升，推理速度比现有视觉鲁棒VLA快50.6倍，在真实FR5机器人上获得65.6%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: RobustVLA有效解决了VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性问题，特别是在真实机器人场景中表现出色，为VLA模型的实际部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CADC框架，通过能力归因数据筛选，仅用5%数据就能超越全数据训练效果，实现可控的指令调优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽视潜在学习能力，导致数据预算减少时性能下降

Method: 无监督发现内在能力，通过梯度学习轨迹和影响估计进行数据归因，采用平衡选择和分阶段排序的课程学习

Result: 仅用5%原始数据就在多模态基准测试中超越全数据训练效果

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建块，CADC为指令数据筛选提供了原则性范式

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力基准，包含2000多张图像和18000多个问答对，用于评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在任务设计上缺乏难度进展，且缺少跨语言任务，同时使用的真实世界图像通常只包含单一文化，使得基准相对容易。

Method: 构建了包含三个难度递增任务的基准：从基础视觉识别到高级文化冲突理解，再到文化内容生成，使用漫画图像来增加文化多样性。

Result: 评估了11个开源MLLMs，发现MLLMs与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距，表明C³B对当前MLLMs构成重大挑战。

Conclusion: C³B基准为MLLMs的文化意识能力提供了重要评估工具，鼓励未来研究推进MLLMs的文化意识能力发展。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了6个开源文本到图像模型中的性别偏见，发现所有模型都表现出系统性的职业刻板印象，如护士总是女性、外科医生主要是男性，但不同模型对提示词的敏感度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意环境中广泛应用，但其输出经常嵌入和放大社会偏见，特别是职业性别刻板印象，需要系统评估和解决。

Method: 使用6个先进开源模型，为5种医院相关职业和5种肖像修饰词组合生成100张图像，分析性别分布和模型对提示词的敏感度。

Result: 所有模型都表现出职业性别刻板印象，但程度不同：Qwen-Image和SDXL男性主导，FLUX.1-dev偏向女性，其他模型也有不同程度偏见。提示词修饰语显著影响性别平衡。

Conclusion: TTI模型中的性别偏见是系统性的且模型特定的，提示词措辞对人口统计结果有重要影响，需要偏见感知设计、平衡默认值和用户指导来防止职业刻板印象强化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一个基于强化学习的提示词反演框架，能够从少量示例图像中恢复其模板，揭示了提示词交易中的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型催生了提示词交易市场，但提示词本身可能被窃取，这带来了未被充分研究的安全风险。

Method: 将模板窃取视为顺序决策问题，采用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数，有效探索提示词空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，将攻击成本降低至现有基线的13%以下，能有效泛化到不同图像风格。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示词交易中紧迫的安全威胁，为新兴MLLMs市场制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EDCT方法，通过生成反事实图像来验证视觉语言模型解释的忠实性，发现模型解释与预测因果因素之间存在显著不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型生成的解释听起来合理但可能不反映真实的预测驱动因素，这种可信度与忠实性的不匹配存在技术和治理风险。

Method: EDCT方法：获取模型答案和解释→解析为可测试视觉概念→通过生成修复生成针对性反事实编辑→使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上测试，EDCT揭示了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了符合监管要求的审计证据。

Conclusion: EDCT能够有效识别模型解释的忠实性问题，为模型可信度评估提供了自动化验证工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe框架通过分层解耦方法解决MLLMs在高分辨率图像理解中的背景干扰问题，无需训练即可显著提升性能并减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法认为MLLMs在高分辨率图像上表现不佳是由于感知限制和小物体识别困难，但本文发现主要问题是复杂背景干扰而非物体大小。

Method: 提出分层解耦框架(HiDe)：1) 使用Token-wise Attention Decoupling(TAD)解耦问题token并识别关键信息token；2) 使用Layout-Preserving Decoupling(LPD)从背景中解耦目标区域并重建紧凑表示。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到新SOTA，将Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别提升至92.1%和91.6%，超越RL方法，内存使用减少75%。

Conclusion: HiDe框架有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率图像理解中的背景干扰问题，无需训练即可实现显著性能提升和内存优化。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSDENet网络，通过结合空间域和频域信息来增强遥感图像分割的细节，特别针对灰度变化导致的语义边缘模糊问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中由于灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，充分利用空间信息。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解高低频分量来优化边界分割，实现双域协同。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个广泛使用的数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的集成，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡区的分割精度，证明了双域方法的有效性。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

### [11] [Less is More: Lean yet Powerful Vision-Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00060)
*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言，将轨迹规划任务表述为下一个路径点预测，通过单阶段端到端框架直接从前置摄像头输入预测轨迹，在nuScenes数据集上实现SOTA性能，提升超过30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义自动驾驶为广义语言任务，利用VLM的生成能力实现端到端轨迹预测，避免传统多阶段方法的复杂性。

Method: 提出Max-V1单阶段端到端框架，将轨迹规划视为序列化的下一个路径点预测问题，采用基于统计建模的原则性监督策略进行模仿学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，相比基线方法整体提升超过30%，在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化能力和跨车辆鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更强大的自动驾驶代理奠定了基础，展示了端到端方法在复杂驾驶策略学习方面的潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的CNN压缩设计空间探索方法和框架，通过基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略和一次性微调过程，显著提升了低秩分解技术的压缩效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩分解技术面临秩选择困难、设计空间庞大、微调时间长、兼容性有限等问题，需要一种更高效的压缩方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 引入基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略，采用一次性微调过程，支持多种低秩分解技术，并在TensorFlow 2.x中实现端到端框架。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著的压缩效果，精度损失最小，优于多种先进技术。

Conclusion: 该框架通过组合多种低秩分解技术和智能秩选择策略，为CNN压缩提供了高效且兼容性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial
intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve
industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more
objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work
developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models
(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无偏平滑神经元(USN)指标的神经网络剪枝方法，通过移除低USN值的神经元来减少过参数化，同时使用Wasserstein距离损失优化剪枝过程，在亮度对比度扰动下的鲁棒关键点检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于传输模型的超光谱异常检测方法在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 生成模型能大规模生成逼真图像，引发了对检测合成图像和溯源来源的迫切需求。现有水印方法对现实失真脆弱、易被自适应移除，且密钥更新成本高。

Method: 将编码问题建模为生成模型参数的密钥相关扰动，提出MOLM框架，通过二进制密钥激活残差块和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，能有效抵抗失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和对提取器的黑盒对抗攻击。

Conclusion: MOLM框架实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性等理想特性，无需密钥特定的重新训练，为生成模型水印提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

Motivation: 现有开放世界检测方法存在已知与未知类别间的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知类别召回率下降和已知类别准确率退化。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（使用子模条件增益函数挖掘未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标解耦已知与未知表示）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别提升已知类别准确率2.83%和2.05%，未知召回率比领先基线提高近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式方法有效解决了开放世界检测中的语义混淆和遗忘问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Conclusion: 通过引入离散小波变换来增强VAE的潜在空间表示，ExpDWT-VAE方法在卫星图像处理中显著提升了潜在扩散模型的性能，为遥感应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想化观测历史，无法处理第一人称视角固有的感知伪影（如遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致模型鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制，通过特征调制将提炼的历史特征条件化到预测解码器。

Result: BiFlow实现最先进性能，平均减少minADE和minFDE 10-15%，表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该基准和模型为开发真正能够抵抗现实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Result: 校准后VLM性能显著提升：肺炎检测F1分数从低于监督模型提升到0.8841（超过CNN的0.8803）；结核病检测F1从0.4812提升到0.7684，接近监督模型的0.7834。

Conclusion: 适当的校准对于发挥零样本VLMs的诊断潜力至关重要，使其能够匹配甚至超越专门的任务特定监督模型。

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

TL;DR: 提出SCNet网络，通过频率控制优化自监督去噪，解决现有方法高频细节保留不足和噪声学习的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督去噪方法存在两个问题：高频结构细节保留不足，以及在拟合高频时学习到噪声

Method: 1. 频率带选择策略加速训练；2. 基于Lipschitz常数的参数优化限制高频噪声学习；3. SSR模块通过频域分离和低秩重建分离噪声与高频细节

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性

Conclusion: SCNet能有效解决自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和噪声学习问题

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA框架能有效提升视觉语言目标检测器在域偏移下的性能，通过空间一致性优化和智能提示选择实现了稳定的性能改进。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在视觉符号组合推理方面存在显著局限，需要建立严格的测试基准来评估和推动视觉与符号组合推理能力的发展。

Method: 构建包含文本引导和纯视觉设置的火柴棍算式修正任务，系统覆盖数字规模、移动复杂度、解的多重性和运算符变化等维度。

Result: 评估14个视觉语言模型发现：闭源模型仅能处理简单情况，开源模型在视觉模式下失败，而人类准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: MathSticks为推进视觉和符号组合推理能力提供了严格的测试平台，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/Yuheng2000/MathSticks.

*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NAGL框架，利用正常和异常样本作为参考，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨域异常检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了现实场景中可用的异常样本包含的宝贵信息

Method: 提出正常-异常引导的通用异常检测方法，包含残差挖掘(RM)提取异常模式和异常特征学习(AFL)自适应学习异常特征

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的GAD方法

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的工作，实现了更准确高效的跨域异常检测

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAF是一种高效的图像特征提取技术，通过融合相对特征和绝对特征来增强基于图像的方法选择，解决稀疏线性系统求解中的方法选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的选择方法存在特征提取问题，可能将不同矩阵编码为相同图像表示，导致相同选择和次优方法。

Method: 提出RAF特征提取技术，同时提取并融合图像表示作为相对特征和对应数值作为绝对特征，实现全面的矩阵表示。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上的评估显示，稀疏线性系统求解时间减少0.08s-0.29s，比传统图像选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过防止特征歧义提高了选择准确性，释放了基于图像选择方法的潜力。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成先验的手部姿态优化方法，利用功能感知的文本描述来指导扩散模型，在严重遮挡情况下重建更准确和功能连贯的3D手部姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手部被自身或物体严重遮挡时的3D姿态重建问题，受人类利用上下文知识（如功能感知）解决歧义的启发。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型学习基于功能感知描述的手部姿态分布，这些描述由大型视觉语言模型推断得出，从而指导遮挡区域的姿态优化。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法在严重遮挡情况下显著优于最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的扩散优化方法。

Conclusion: 功能感知引导的优化能够显著改善手部姿态估计，特别是在严重遮挡场景下，证明了上下文知识在手部姿态重建中的重要性。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出EPIC框架，通过渐进式一致性蒸馏解决多模态大模型中视觉token压缩带来的训练困难问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉token在多模态大模型中消耗大量计算资源，现有压缩方法忽视了压缩带来的特征空间扰动导致的训练难度增加

Method: 将token压缩引入的特征空间扰动分解为token维度和层维度，分别引入token一致性蒸馏和层一致性蒸馏，利用教师模型指导进行渐进学习

Result: 大量实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进式一致性蒸馏有效解决了视觉token压缩带来的训练困难，提升了多模态大模型的效率

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

### [33] [CardioBench: Do Echocardiography Foundation Models Generalize Beyond the Lab?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00520)
*Darya Taratynova,Ahmed Aly,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench是一个用于评估超声心动图基础模型的标准化基准，整合了8个公开数据集，涵盖4个回归和5个分类任务，在不同协议下评估多种模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型应用有限，缺乏标准化评估基准，现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，限制了可比性。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准化套件，在一致的零样本、探测和对齐协议下评估心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器。

Result: 发现不同模型家族具有互补优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下具有鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器能捕捉生理意义轴。

Conclusion: CardioBench建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供实用指导，通用编码器表现良好但在细粒度区分上仍有困难。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

*Taeyun Woo,Jinah Park,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从粗到细的级联扩散框架，结合概率建模与级联优化，用于3D手部姿态重建，在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定性模型在处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节姿态时存在模糊性问题，现有级联方法无法捕捉姿态不确定性，而概率方法仅限于单阶段估计且缺乏优化能力。

Method: 两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段使用联合扩散模型采样多样的3D关节假设，第二阶段使用网格潜在扩散模型基于关节样本重建3D手部网格，在学习的潜在空间中训练以学习分布感知的关节-网格关系。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时有效建模了姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了概率建模与级联优化的优势，解决了3D手部姿态重建中的模糊性和不确定性挑战。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

TL;DR: 提出了Forestpest-YOLO检测框架，专门针对林业遥感图像中的农业害虫检测问题，通过集成SPD-Conv、CSPOK和VarifocalLoss三项创新，在小目标和遮挡目标检测方面取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 林业遥感图像中的农业害虫检测面临目标微小、严重遮挡、与复杂背景视觉相似等挑战，传统目标检测模型因细粒度特征丢失和数据极度不平衡而表现不佳。

Method: 基于YOLOv8架构，集成了三项创新：1）SPD-Conv无损下采样模块保留小目标的高分辨率细节；2）CSPOK跨阶段特征融合块增强多尺度特征表示并抑制背景噪声；3）VarifocalLoss训练目标优化，使模型关注高质量和难分类样本。

Result: 在自建的ForestPest数据集上的大量实验表明，Forestpest-YOLO实现了最先进的性能，在小目标和遮挡害虫检测方面显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO框架有效解决了林业遥感图像中害虫检测的挑战，为生态保护提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

*Henrik Pichler,Janis Keuper,Matthew Copping*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文展示了在微生物学图像分析中，视觉基础模型可以在极少标注数据下达到与传统方法相当的性能，显著减少数据标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量人工标注数据，过程耗时耗力。本文旨在证明使用视觉基础模型可以大幅减少数据标注需求。

Method: 构建了5000张培养皿图像数据集，模拟传统、少样本和极少量样本场景。对比了三种视觉基础模型与传统基线模型在特定任务指标上的表现。

Result: MaskDINO仅用150张图像微调就能接近充分训练的YoloV9性能，仅用25张图像仍能保持竞争力，在约70%样本上保持可靠。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能够以传统方法所需数据的一小部分达到相同效果，为自动化微生物系统开发提供了更快迭代和更高性能上限的可能。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

TL;DR: 提出自适应共享专家(ASE)方法，在基于LoRA的混合专家框架中引入共享专家，通过路由器计算的门控权重与稀疏专家联合归一化，改善从单任务到多任务学习的过渡，增强专家专业化和协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE-MTL方法依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务学习到多任务学习的过渡中存在冗余适应和低效知识共享的问题。

Method: 在基于LoRA的MoE框架中引入自适应共享专家，共享专家与稀疏专家通过路由器计算的门控权重联合归一化；同时通过增加LoRA专家数量并成比例降低其秩来引入细粒度专家，在可比参数预算下实现更有效的知识共享。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试中的广泛实验表明，ASE在各种配置下持续提升性能，并验证了细粒度设计对MTL的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE-MTL中从单任务到多任务学习的过渡问题，提升了专家专业化和协作能力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

TL;DR: ArbInterp是一个创新的视频帧插值框架，支持在任何时间戳生成任意长度的中间帧，解决了现有方法只能合成固定数量帧的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式视频帧插值方法只能合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏调整生成帧率或总序列时长的灵活性。

Method: 提出了Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE)来支持任意时间戳插值，以及将长序列生成分解为分段帧合成的策略，采用外观-运动解耦条件机制确保跨片段的无缝时空过渡。

Result: 在2x到32x的多尺度帧插值基准测试中，ArbInterp在所有场景下都优于先前方法，具有更高的保真度和更无缝的时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp通过创新的时间戳感知位置编码和分段生成策略，成功实现了任意时间戳和任意长度的视频帧插值，为视频生成应用提供了更大的灵活性。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息集成到原始NeRF流程中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果都不理想。

Method: 提出多级特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示，动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成到内容模式中，通过多级级联解码器生成最终风格化视图。

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF通过重新设计NeRF流程和创新的动态风格注入，实现了高质量的3D风格迁移，支持全视角风格迁移。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Conclusion: ADPT框架为高保真数据集构建提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，为结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务提供有力支持

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

Motivation: 在视觉语言导航中，前景区域提供语义线索，背景区域包含空间连接信息，但这两者在视觉观察中的重要性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用语义增强的地标识别来分离前景和背景作为候选增强特征，然后通过共识驱动的在线增强策略，让智能体根据不同的指令和导航位置来整合两阶段投票结果。

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上的实验表明，这种在线前景-背景特征增强方法提升了基线的泛化能力，并达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 前景和背景特征的交替使用能够有效提升视觉语言导航的泛化性能，COFA策略在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

### [43] [Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00618)
*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR提出了一种同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知的视觉识别方法，通过将定位作为识别的组成部分来解耦对象中心和上下文建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习会导致模型过度依赖背景信息，产生虚假相关性的捷径学习，限制了模型在真实世界部署中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来解决这个问题，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，解耦对象中心和上下文建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。该方法不需要微调即可提升监督模型和VLM在域内和域外背景数据集上的性能。

Result: RCOR在ImageNet-1k等复杂场景中实现了定位先于识别的能力，提升了监督模型和VLM在域内和域外背景数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: RCOR是首个同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知而不牺牲任何一方的视觉识别方法，证明了在复杂场景中定位先于识别的可行性。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

Motivation: 对抗训练在一步生成中很关键，但GAN训练难以收敛且存在模式崩溃问题。作者定量分析发现条件判别器中的冗余捷径阻碍了有意义的特征提取。

Method: 提出无条件判别器(UCD)，移除判别器的条件输入，强制其提取更全面鲁棒的特征，从而为生成器提供更好的监督信号。该方法与原始GAN理论兼容，可作为插件使用。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上取得了1.47 FID的优异结果，超越了StyleGAN-XL和多个最先进的一步扩散模型，表现出显著性能提升和高效率。

Conclusion: 无条件判别器能有效促进GAN训练中的纳什均衡，显著提升生成质量，且具有理论保证和实际可行性。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了几何先验与网络学习过程，为深度伪造检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: ReFlux为评估整流流变换器中概念擦除策略的鲁棒性建立了可靠的基准，填补了现有攻击评估方法的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

Conclusion: SpecMCD方法在不同云覆盖条件下具有优越性和潜力，能够有效提升云检测精度。

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

Result: AYT能显著加速CM训练，甚至超越LPIPS指标，并且能在极小批量大小下训练而不影响样本质量。

Conclusion: AYT方法通过解决CM训练中的振荡切线问题，实现了训练效率的显著提升和样本质量的改进。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架为生成模型提供了新的几何解释，MPPM模型在性能上超越了现有扩散模型，证明了统一几何和概率视角的有效性。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件-图像知识蒸馏的框架，利用CLIP的语义理解能力实现事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，通过混合脉冲神经网络和卷积神经网络解决事件数据分割中的信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在目标检测中具有高速响应、低延迟和抗运动模糊等优势，但缺乏纹理和颜色信息，使得开放词汇检测面临挑战。现有事件检测方法通常只能在预定义类别上训练，难以泛化到新物体。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过基于空间注意力的蒸馏方法指导事件学生模型学习CLIP的丰富视觉表示。设计了混合SNN-CNN框架，SNN自适应确定最佳事件分割时刻，CNN处理提取的事件特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法能够直接从原始事件输入中学习有意义的视觉特征，同时继承CLIP的广泛视觉知识，避免了固定分组事件分割方法造成的关键时间信息丢失问题。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功弥合了图像和事件流之间的模态差距，实现了事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，为事件相机在复杂场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

TL;DR: 该论文提出ProtoMask模型，使用图像分割基础模型来改进原型案例推理方法的可解释性，通过将显著性图计算限制在预定义的语义图像块中来提高可视化结果的真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于原型案例推理的XAI方法通常依赖额外的后处理显著性技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术的可靠性和质量受到质疑。作者旨在通过图像分割基础模型来改进嵌入空间到输入空间的映射真实性。

Method: 使用图像分割基础模型生成分割掩码，利用每个掩码的边界框裁剪图像，每个掩码作为ProtoMask新模型架构的独立输入，将显著性图计算限制在语义图像块内。

Result: 在三个细粒度分类数据集上的实验表明，该模型具有竞争性的性能表现和独特的可解释性特征。

Conclusion: ProtoMask模型通过结合图像分割技术，有效提高了原型案例推理方法的可解释性和可视化结果的真实性，在保持竞争性能的同时提供了更好的解释能力。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个基于推理的概念瓶颈模型框架，通过图变换器和专家混合模块增强概念关系建模，在多数据集上实现了更高的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)通常是单模态的，忽略了概念间的结构化关系，无法适应复杂的概念推理模式。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来显式建模概念关系，集成图变换器捕获多层次依赖，并用专家混合模块替代前馈层以动态分配推理任务。

Result: MoE-SGT在多个数据集上比其他概念瓶颈网络实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过建模概念间的结构化关系并利用动态专家选择机制，MoE-SGT显著提升了模型对复杂概念推理的适应能力。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的多模态大语言模型框架，利用模型内在不确定性作为指导信号来提升细粒度感知能力，在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位等任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务（如高分辨率图像中的小物体识别、长视频中的关键时刻定位）上表现不佳，现有方法通常需要复杂的任务特定微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 利用MLLM内在不确定性作为主动指导信号，通过响应不确定性对候选视觉输入进行评分，使模型能够自主关注最显著的数据。这是一个无需训练的统一机制。

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位三个复杂视觉任务中，现成的MLLM能够达到与专门微调方法相竞争的性能水平。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强多模态细粒度性能的强大通用策略，验证了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督深度学习的运动校正方法，用于心脏磁共振灌注成像，替代传统的迭代配准方法，显著提高了处理速度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于配准的运动校正方法速度慢且对采集变异性敏感，限制了定量灌注成像的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习管道，通过三步运动校正和鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关影响，对齐灌注序列和辅助图像。在201名患者的多厂商数据上训练和验证。

Result: 深度学习方法显著改善了时间-强度曲线的时序平滑度，心肌对齐效果与基线相当但优于未配准状态，灌注图显示运动减少，处理时间减少了15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道能够实现快速、鲁棒的运动校正，提高了动态和辅助图像的准确性，经过多厂商数据训练后能够泛化到不同序列，可能促进定量灌注成像的临床推广。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

TL;DR: 该研究使用12个EEG通道（而非传统的32个通道）通过连续小波变换和视觉变换器模型实现了91.57%的情感分类准确率，证明了低成本EEG设备在情感预测中的可行性。

Motivation: 传统情感预测方法（如自我评估和面部表情分析）存在主观性和模糊性问题，而完整EEG测量复杂且资源密集。研究旨在探索使用简化EEG设备进行准确情感预测的可能性。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集的EEG通道子集，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，然后训练视觉变换器模型进行情感分类。

Result: 仅使用12个测量点（通道）实现了91.57%的准确率，预测4个象限（高/低唤醒度和效价），与使用32个通道的最先进结果96.9%相比表现优异。

Conclusion: 显著减少输入通道数量仍能获得高准确率，证明了低成本EEG设备在情感预测中的实用价值。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决极端盲图像恢复(EBIR)的新框架，通过将ELQ到HQ的恢复过程分解为两步：先将ELQ图像投影到中间LQ流形，再用现成的BIR模型恢复为HQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲图像恢复方法在面临极端退化(超出训练范围的多重严重退化)时表现不佳，直接学习ELQ到HQ的映射由于巨大的域差距会导致不自然的伪影和细节丢失。

Method: 提出两步分解框架：1)学习投影器将ELQ图像映射到中间LQ流形；2)使用冻结的现成BIR模型将中间图像恢复为HQ。基于信息瓶颈理论推导训练目标函数。

Result: 在严重退化场景下进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架支持推理时即时优化(LFO)和即插即用增强现有图像恢复模型，无需微调。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Motivation: 在陶瓷制造中，无损检测对于确保组件质量而不损害其完整性至关重要。光学相干断层扫描能够进行高分辨率内部成像，但需要自动化的缺陷检测方法。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per

Motivation: 现有图像-文本对齐评估方法缺乏全面基准，且缺少关键特性：与人类判断对齐、长序列处理、推理效率和适用于多目标评分。

Method: 基于大型视觉语言模型构建插件式架构，在冻结隐藏状态上训练轻量级岭回归层，生成细粒度多目标评分。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP为可靠视觉语言应用提供了强大的评估工具，新数据集EYE4ALL为开发更易访问的AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零查询黑盒对抗攻击方法ZQBA，利用深度神经网络的特征表示生成对抗样本，无需多次查询或训练扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击方法需要多次查询或训练扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这在现实场景中应用受限。

Method: 使用DNN获取的特征图添加到干净图像中，以破坏目标模型的分类性能，实现单次查询攻击。

Result: ZQBA能够将对抗样本迁移到不同模型和数据集（CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet），在单次查询下比现有方法更有效，同时保持扰动不可感知。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了DNN在现实应用中的脆弱性，提供了一种高效的黑盒攻击方案。

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法在概念瓶颈模型的第二阶段实现了不确定性感知和可解释性，通过概念原型距离机制同时提升了分类性能和不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在处理语言变体时缺乏语义一致性，即使逻辑等价的提示词也会产生语义不一致的图像，暴露了模型推理和泛化能力的不足。

Method: 利用蜕变测试生成语义相同但语法不同的提示词对，直接比较生成的图像对来识别语义不一致性，无需真实图像基准。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2I模型上评估，发现Flux.dev和DALLE-3分别有59%和71%的错位率，揭示了现有模型在逻辑一致性方面的系统性失败。

Conclusion: MetaLogic提供了一种可扩展、无需基准的评估方法，能有效发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题，可用于模型调试和改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and
applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and
building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment. Code is available at:

*Fan Yang,Zhiyang Chen,Yousong Zhu,Xin Li,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TrajVLM-Gen两阶段框架，通过预测符合物理规律的运动轨迹来改善视频生成的物理一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型产生的运动存在物理不一致问题，违反了真实世界动力学规律

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用视觉语言模型预测粗粒度运动轨迹；2) 通过基于注意力的机制进行细粒度运动精炼

Result: 在UCF-101和MSR-VTT数据集上表现优于现有方法，分别达到545和539的FVD分数

Conclusion: TrajVLM-Gen通过物理感知的轨迹引导机制，显著提升了视频生成的物理一致性

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

### [70] [What You See is What You Ask: Evaluating Audio Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00808)
*Divy Kala,Eshika Khandelwal,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ADQA基准，用于在几分钟长的连贯视频片段上评估音频描述(AD)，通过视觉欣赏和叙事理解问题测试AD质量，发现当前自动AD生成方法远不及人工编写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动AD生成研究主要关注几秒钟的剪辑片段，且仅与单一参考AD比较，但AD编写具有主观性。通过分析同一电影的两个独立AD轨道，量化了描述时机、内容和重点的主观性差异。

Method: 提出ADQA基准，在几分钟长的连贯视频片段上评估AD，包含视觉欣赏(VA)问题测试视觉事实理解，以及叙事理解(NU)问题测试情节理解。

Result: 通过ADQA基准测试发现，当前AD生成方法在帮助BLV用户理解故事和欣赏视觉细节方面，远远落后于人工编写的AD。

Conclusion: 基于剪辑片段的研究不足，需要在更长的连贯视频片段上评估AD。提出了公共排行榜用于基准测试，并为未来工作提供了若干建议。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PhraseStereo数据集，这是首个将短语-区域分割扩展到立体图像对的数据集，通过GenStereo从单视图数据生成右视图图像，为多模态学习提供深度线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的短语定位研究主要局限于单视图图像，忽略了立体视觉中丰富的几何线索，需要将短语定位扩展到立体视觉领域。

Method: 基于PhraseCut数据集，利用GenStereo生成准确的右视图图像，构建包含对齐分割掩码和短语标注的立体图像对数据集。

Result: 创建了PhraseStereo数据集，为语言、视觉和3D感知交叉领域的研究奠定了基础，支持模型在语义和几何上的联合推理。

Conclusion: PhraseStereo数据集将推动开发能够同时处理语义和几何信息的多模态模型，该数据集将在论文接受后公开发布。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

### [72] [NSARM: Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling for Robust Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00820)
*Xiangtao Kong,Rongyuan Wu,Shuaizheng Liu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSARM是一个基于视觉自回归模型的实时图像超分辨率框架，通过两阶段训练实现高效高质量的超分辨率重建，在保持快速推理的同时显著提升了输入图像质量变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Real-ISR方法存在效率与质量之间的权衡：基于扩散模型的方法质量高但速度慢，直接输入的方法速度快但质量低，且都容易产生过度增强的伪影和幻觉，对输入图像质量变化的鲁棒性较差。

Method: 基于视觉自回归模型的逐尺度预测策略，采用两阶段训练：首先训练转换网络将低质量图像映射到初步尺度，然后进行端到端的全模型微调，增强模型在Real-ISR任务中的鲁棒性而不损害生成能力。

Result: 广泛的定量和定性评估表明，NSARM作为纯AR模型，在保持快速推理速度的同时，实现了优于现有Real-ISR方法的视觉效果，并且对输入图像质量表现出更高的鲁棒性和更强的泛化性能。

Conclusion: NSARM框架成功解决了Real-ISR中效率与质量的权衡问题，通过综合微调策略显著提升了模型鲁棒性，为实时高质量图像超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新颖的层次对比学习方法（HMLC），分别基于高斯混合模型（G-HMLC）和注意力机制（A-HMLC），在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次类别间的内在关系，从而丢失重要的监督信号。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型和注意力机制来捕捉层次特定特征，显式建模类间关系和更高层次的不平衡类别分布。

Result: 在线性评估中，该方法在准确率上比现有层次对比学习方法高出2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算机视觉及其他领域具有应用潜力，其有效性得到了定量和定性结果的支持。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

*Kevin Zhang,Kuangzhi Ge,Xiaowei Chi,Renrui Zhang,Shaojun Shi,Zhen Dong,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了将视频生成世界模型的先验知识迁移到视觉语言模型中的潜力，提出了World-Language Models (WorldLMs)框架，其中最佳变体Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA)在空间推理任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式世界模型在视频数据上的训练日益强大，它们能否替代传统的视觉编码器范式来进行通用多模态理解？本文旨在系统性地探索世界模型先验在视觉语言模型中的能力。

Method: 将视频扩散模型重新用作生成编码器，执行单步去噪操作，并将得到的潜在表示作为视觉嵌入。通过广泛的模型设计探索，提出了Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA)方法。

Result: WorldLMs能够捕获对下游理解有用的潜在表示，与传统编码器有明显区别。DyVA显著增强了空间推理能力，使单图像模型能够执行多帧推理，在视觉推理任务上超越了开源和专有基线。

Conclusion: WorldLMs继承了视频预训练中的运动一致性内部化特性，为利用世界模型先验的新型视觉语言模型家族铺平了道路，是通向通用视觉学习者的有前景路径。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

*Hyun-kyu Ko,Youbin Kim,Jihyeon Park,Dongheok Park,Gyeongjin Kang,Wonjun Cho,Hyung Yi,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GSMamba，一种结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型和移位窗口自注意力的混合架构，用于视频超分辨率，通过Gather-Scatter机制解决遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN在视频超分辨率中存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer虽然能建模全局上下文但计算复杂度高且对长序列扩展性有限。Mamba提供了线性时间复杂度的选择性状态空间模型，但单独使用难以捕捉细粒度空间依赖。

Method: 提出混合架构：使用移位窗口自注意力进行空间上下文聚合，结合Mamba选择性扫描进行高效时序传播。引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制，在Mamba传播前将特征向中心锚帧扭曲，传播后再散射回去，减少遮挡伪影。

Result: 该方法有效解决了传统方法的局限性，在保持强长程建模能力的同时实现了线性时间复杂度。

Conclusion: GSMamba通过结合选择性状态空间模型和注意力机制，为视频超分辨率提供了高效且有效的解决方案，特别适合处理长序列视频数据。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AI-CNet3D的新型混合深度学习模型，通过将交叉注意力机制集成到3D CNN中，从OCT体积中提取关键特征，提高青光眼分类性能，同时减少参数数量100倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统将3D OCT体积压缩为2D报告的做法导致关键结构细节丢失，需要更好的方法来保留3D信息进行青光眼诊断。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制的3D CNN模型，沿两个轴分割体积并应用交叉注意力，引入CAREs可视化交叉注意力输出，并与Grad-CAMs对齐进行多任务微调。

Result: 在两个大型数据集上验证，模型在所有关键指标上优于最先进的注意力和卷积模型，同时计算效率高。

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D模型在保持高诊断性能的同时，显著减少了参数数量，提供了更好的可解释性和解剖学一致性。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过任务型调查探讨了医学影像迁移学习中源数据集选择的问题，发现选择受任务依赖性、社区实践、数据集属性和相似性感知影响，挑战了"越相似越好"的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像迁移学习中，源数据集的选择通常依赖研究者直觉而非系统原则，这会影响算法的泛化性和患者预后。研究旨在从人机交互视角理解实践者如何选择源数据集。

Method: 采用任务型调查方法，对机器学习实践者进行研究，关注他们选择源数据集时的决策过程和影响因素。

Result: 发现选择是任务依赖性的，受社区实践、数据集属性、计算嵌入以及感知的视觉或语义相似性影响。相似性评分与预期性能并不总是一致。参与者常使用模糊术语。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰的定义和人机交互工具来明确这些启发式方法，为迁移学习中更系统的源选择提供实用见解。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D面部扫描的手动标注耗时且依赖专家经验，现有深度学习方法多关注伪标志点或需要复杂输入表示，限制了临床适用性。

Method: 结合粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤、初始标志点近似，以及增强注意力机制的基于补丁的点状CNN。

Result: 在214个健康成人标注扫描上，平均定位误差3.686毫米，解剖距离误差2.822毫米；在FaceScape数据集700个对象上，点误差0.41毫米，距离误差0.38毫米。

Conclusion: PAL-Net在准确性和计算成本间取得良好平衡，为高通量3D人体测量分析提供了轻量级可扩展解决方案，有潜力支持临床工作流程并减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Conclusion: 基于新发现的向量平移特征对齐框架在跨分辨率行人重识别任务中表现出有效性和优越性，为相关研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

TL;DR: 提出了InfVSR方法，将视频超分辨率重新定义为自回归单步扩散范式，实现了流式推理，解决了长视频处理中的效率和可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个挑战：(1) 全序列多步去噪计算成本高导致效率低下；(2) 时间分解导致伪影和不连续，可扩展性差。

Method: 1. 将预训练DiT调整为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉引导保持局部和全局一致性；2. 将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，使用补丁级像素监督和跨块分布匹配。

Result: 实现了无边界长度视频的高效可扩展超分辨率，在新建的长视频基准上达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，比MGLD-VSR等方法快达58倍。

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的前沿，提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，同时保持了高质量的语义一致性。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

Motivation: 现代文本到图像生成主要依赖基于标记的架构，但文本与视觉标记的有效融合仍然是一个挑战。需要开发能够平衡条件强度和骨干通用性的融合方法。

Method: 提出JEPA-T框架：将图像和标题编码为离散标记，通过联合嵌入预测Transformer处理；在特征预测器后加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪；在流匹配损失前注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐；同一网络在推理时执行类条件和自由文本图像生成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的评估显示，JEPA-T实现了强大的数据效率和开放词汇泛化能力，始终优于非融合和后期融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于标记的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与骨干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

TL;DR: FastForward是一种单次前向传播的视觉定位方法，能够在极短时间内完成地图构建和查询图像定位，无需传统方法所需的长时间地图准备过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机姿态的映射图像开始，在最坏情况下仍需要数小时的地图构建时间，最佳情况也需要数分钟。本研究旨在探索能否在更短时间内实现具有竞争力的定位精度。

Method: 将多个映射图像表示为3D空间中锚定的特征集合，利用这些映射特征预测查询图像与场景之间的对应关系，从而估计查询图像的相机姿态。该方法与图像检索相结合。

Result: 与需要最少地图准备时间的其他方法相比，FastForward实现了最先进的定位精度，并且在未见过的领域（包括具有挑战性的大规模室外环境）表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FastForward证明了在单次前向传播中同时完成地图构建和视觉定位的可行性，显著减少了传统方法所需的地图准备时间，同时保持了高精度和良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种即插即用的精炼模块，通过后预训练步骤增强自回归模型中视觉序列的空间对应关系建模，改善视觉语言建模质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在视觉语言数据建模中存在空间视觉信号与顺序依赖预测之间的冲突，导致次优结果。

Method: 设计了一个精炼模块作为后预训练步骤，联合精炼自回归模型生成的所有token，利用全局上下文和token间关系来缓解顺序生成中的错误累积问题。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的精炼模块有效改善了自回归模型在视觉语言建模中的性能，特别是在处理空间对应关系方面。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SoftCFG方法，通过不确定性引导的推理机制解决自回归模型中分类器自由引导的指导衰减和过度指导问题，在ImageNet 256上达到自回归模型中最优的FID分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中面临分类器自由引导的两个关键问题：指导衰减（条件-无条件差距随解码进展快速消失）和过度指导（强条件扭曲视觉连贯性）。

Method: 提出SoftCFG方法，通过让每个生成token贡献确定性加权的指导，在序列中分布自适应扰动；引入Step Normalization来限制SoftCFG的累积扰动，稳定长序列生成。

Result: SoftCFG显著提高了图像质量，在ImageNet 256上实现了自回归模型中最优的FID分数。

Conclusion: SoftCFG是一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，可无缝集成到现有自回归流程中，有效解决了CFG在AR模型中的应用问题。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM是一个新颖的解释框架，通过结合CAM的空间定位能力和视觉语言模型的语义对齐，为深度视觉模型提供文本化的解释，同时指出模型关注的位置和视觉属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAM及其变体虽然能突出显示驱动预测的空间区域，但缺乏对这些激活背后语义属性的洞察，限制了在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 结合CAM的空间定位和视觉语言模型的语义对齐，使用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获得通道级语义表示，并通过CAM权重聚合生成文本描述。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能产生忠实且可解释的推理，提高人类理解能力，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM通过将CAM与自然语言相结合，提供了更丰富的语义解释，增强了深度视觉模型的可解释性和可信度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POVQA是一种数据高效的方法，通过将每秒视频压缩为单个时间池化图像，并使用轻量级监督对齐大型视觉语言模型，显著提升了视频问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在视频问答中虽然能处理1500+帧的长上下文，但仅对应50秒视频且信息损失严重。需要一种数据高效的方法来压缩视频信息并提升模型性能。

Method: 构建1fps输入源（使用混合模糊、加权平均、指数和斜坡池化等变体），在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B进行监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO），包含推理和最终答案的两轮目标。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升到0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升到0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升到0.528，推理质量也显著提高。跨池化函数评估显示增益具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: POVQA通过时间池化和轻量级监督有效压缩视频信息，显著提升了视频问答性能，且在不同池化方案下都表现出强鲁棒性，在TVQA的零样本测试中也观察到类似结果。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

TL;DR: ImageDoctor是一个统一的多方面文本到图像模型评估框架，通过四个维度评估图像质量并提供像素级缺陷热图，可作为密集奖励用于模型偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一标量量化生成图像质量，无法提供全面且可解释的反馈。需要更全面的评估框架来支持文本到图像模型的偏好对齐。

Method: 引入"观察-思考-预测"范式：先定位潜在缺陷，生成推理，最后给出定量评分。基于视觉语言模型，结合监督微调和强化学习训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上与人类偏好高度一致，作为奖励模型进行偏好调优时，比基于标量的奖励模型提升10%的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageDoctor作为评估指标有效，且作为奖励模型能显著提升文本到图像模型的生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的高光谱分类模型对对抗攻击高度脆弱，而现有防御方法通常依赖定制化设计，可扩展性有限且无法有效防御强攻击。

Method: 将对抗训练引入高光谱领域，并提出AT-RA方法，通过数据增强技术增加光谱信息多样性并确保空间平滑性，以保留和校正高光谱图像中的光谱语义信息。

Result: 实验结果显示AT-RA将对抗鲁棒性提升了21.34%（对抗AutoAttack）和18.78%（对抗PGD-50），同时将良性准确率提高了2.68%。

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据中对抗噪声和非平滑对抗样本破坏光谱语义信息的问题，显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Motivation: 当前人脸匿名化方法难以在安全性、图像质量和可逆性之间取得良好平衡，扩散模型缺乏密钥机制确保只有授权方才能逆转过程。

Method: 将密钥与扩散模型的潜在人脸表示结合，使用面部掩码约束生成以保持身份无关特征，采用确定性前向和后向扩散过程确保只有正确密钥才能恢复原始人脸。

Result: 该方法生成的人脸匿名化图像与原始人脸视觉相似度更低，相比其他方法效果更好。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功实现了安全、高质量且可逆的人脸匿名化，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

TL;DR: 提出了Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD)框架，直接在one-hot空间保持扩散核心特性，通过协调机制重新定义伪离散扩散方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪离散扩散方法依赖连续潜在空间扩散或掩码策略，ADD旨在直接在one-hot空间保持扩散特性，建立判别式与生成式学习的桥梁。

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，在扩散模型输出与原始one-hot标签之间建立联系。

Result: 在分类任务上优于基线方法，在图像描述任务上展现出优秀的文本生成能力，各组件均带来可测量的性能提升。

Conclusion: ADD框架成功在one-hot空间实现了真正的离散扩散，建立了判别式与生成式学习的协同设计，在多项任务上表现优异。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法在语义上局限于预定义关系集，且在大环境中序列化容易超出LLM上下文窗口，限制了机器人在复杂人机环境中的推理、规划和导航能力。

Method: 构建层次化3D场景图，节点通过优化几何和视觉覆盖的关键帧增强多模态信息，利用VLM提取场景信息，采用分层检索增强生成(RAG)管道从图中提取相关上下文。

Result: 在四个不同基准测试（包括3D对象分割和复杂查询检索）中，KeySG在大多数指标上优于先前方法，展示了其优越的语义丰富性和效率。

Conclusion: KeySG框架通过层次化图表示和关键帧增强，有效解决了3D场景图的语义局限性和可扩展性问题，为机器人在复杂环境中的推理和规划提供了更强大的支持。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在自动驾驶系统中应用日益广泛，但幻觉问题限制了其在安全关键管道中的可靠性，需要开发能够校准模型输出、放大可靠模型一致性的融合方法。

Method: 使用博弈论融合方法学习每个模型、每个标签在特定上下文条件下的可靠性，将模型报告转换为带一致性保护的似然比，结合上下文先验和基于Shapley的团队信用更新的公共声誉状态，生成可校准的后验概率。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了基于代码的视频生成方法在可扩展性、可解释性和可控性方面的潜力，为教育视频制作提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable

generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个结合全景视频生成与演化3D记忆的世界模型，通过利用演化3D重建作为视频生成的空间指导，显著提升了视觉真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类在先前体验过的3D环境中进行心理探索和回放能力的启发，旨在实现空间一致的长时程探索。

Method: 首先基于单张全景图像生成未来视频帧，然后使用前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建，最后通过几何重投影从演化3D记忆中合成未来帧。

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的基准测试中，演化3D记忆显著提升了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性。

Conclusion: EvoWorld代表了向长时程空间一致世界建模的重要进展，演化3D记忆相比现有方法大幅改善了视觉真实性和空间一致性。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

TL;DR: IMAGEdit是一个无需训练的视频多主体编辑框架，能够同时编辑任意数量的视频主体外观，同时保持非目标区域不变，无需微调或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频编辑中多主体编辑的挑战，包括提示侧多模态条件不足和视频中掩码边界纠缠问题，扩展视频编辑的适用性。

Method: 通过提示引导的多模态对齐模块和基于先验的掩码重定向模块，提供强大的多模态条件和精确的掩码序列，然后使用预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型合成编辑后的视频。

Result: 在新建的多主体基准MSVBench上的大量实验验证，IMAGEdit始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: IMAGEdit具有强大的泛化能力，兼容任何掩码驱动视频生成模型，显著提升了视频多主体编辑的整体性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are
publicly available at https://github.com/XWH-A/IMAGEdit.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于双角色长时程交互中间帧生成的方法，通过跨空间中间帧建模和对抗学习来维持交互质量和运动质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中间帧生成方法主要针对单个角色，扩展到密集交互角色时面临时空对应精确性、自然过渡和长时程稳定性的挑战

Method: 提出跨空间中间帧方法，在不同条件表示空间中建模角色交互；使用对抗学习识别周期性交互模式；学习精炼漂移的潜在空间以防止姿态误差累积

Result: 能够生成逼真、可控、长时程的双角色交互中间帧运动，支持动态拳击和舞蹈动作，通过定量评估和用户研究验证

Conclusion: 该方法在维持交互质量和运动质量方面表现出色，能够有效解决双角色长时程交互中间帧生成的挑战

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is the problem to synthesize movement between keyposes.
Traditional research focused primarily on single characters. Extending them to
densely interacting characters is highly challenging, as it demands precise
spatial-temporal correspondence between the characters to maintain the
interaction, while creating natural transitions towards predefined keyposes. In
this research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening
that enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To
effectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution
called Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each
character across different conditioning representation spaces. We further
observe that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters
heavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and
diminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present
two solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby
keeping synthesis in the stable region of the solution space.We first sustain
interaction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through
adversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to
refine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We
demonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and
long-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and
dancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative
evaluations and user studies.

*Mark Boss,Andreas Engelhardt,Simon Donné,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出Reservoir SWD(ReSWD)方法，通过加权储层采样在优化过程中自适应保留信息丰富的投影方向，降低Sliced Wasserstein距离的方差，提供更稳定的梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维分布中Wasserstein距离计算成本过高，而Sliced Wasserstein距离的蒙特卡洛估计器方差大，导致梯度噪声大、收敛慢。

Method: 将加权储层采样集成到SWD中，在优化步骤中自适应保留信息丰富的投影方向，同时保持无偏性。

Result: 在合成基准测试和实际任务（如颜色校正和扩散引导）中，ReSWD始终优于标准SWD和其他方差减少基线方法。

Conclusion: ReSWD通过降低SWD的方差，提供了更稳定的梯度，同时保持无偏性，在各种应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the
widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional
distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable
alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance,
resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD
(ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively
retain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in
stable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks
and real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that
ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction
baselines. Project page: https://reservoirswd.github.io/

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种音频驱动的实时系统，用于以最小延迟为真实感3D面部头像制作动画，核心是通过编码器模型将音频信号实时转换为潜在面部表情序列，并利用扩散模型的生成能力实现自然通信所需的各种面部表情。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为虚拟现实中的社交互动设计一个能够实时生成真实感3D面部动画的系统，解决现有方法延迟高、无法满足实时交互需求的问题。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，核心创新包括：在线transformer消除对未来输入的依赖、蒸馏管道将迭代去噪加速为单步处理、处理连续音频信号的帧级处理方法。

Result: 实现了实时性能（GPU时间<15ms），面部动画准确性显著优于现有离线方法，推理速度提升100到1000倍，支持多语言演讲等多种场景。

Conclusion: 该系统成功实现了低延迟、高质量的实时面部动画生成，为虚拟现实社交互动提供了有效的解决方案，并展示了在多模态应用中的扩展潜力。

Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D
facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in
virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that
transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time,
which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the
generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of
facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving
real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes
latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates
dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates
iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design
challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals
frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility
of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic
modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted
eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed.
We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various
scenarios such as multilingual speeches.

Conclusion: ToolBrain降低了研究人员和从业者将LLM代理适配到特定领域的门槛，提供了高效的工具使用训练框架。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

Motivation: 大型推理语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但存在计算效率低下的问题，现有方法难以平衡推理质量与推理成本

Method: 提出自适应推理抑制方法，采用多检查点确定性估计机制和渐进抑制阈值，无需训练即可动态抑制冗余推理步骤

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ARS实现了53%的token减少、46.1%的延迟降低和57.9%的能耗降低，同时保持或提高了准确性

Conclusion: ARS方法在多个模型架构上均表现出色，能够有效解决推理模型的过度思考问题，实现推理效率的显著提升

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant

Motivation: 当前AI政策制定缺乏科学共识形成机制，而NeurIPS作为AI领域的领先会议，具备推动这一进程的独特优势。

Method: 建议NeurIPS借鉴IPCC在气候政策共识形成方面的经验，开展试点项目，主动催化AI政策领域的科学共识。

Result: 识别了当前AI政策共识形成的空白，论证了NeurIPS是最佳选择，并提出了具体的实施建议。

Conclusion: NeurIPS应该在AI政策领域发挥领导作用，通过推动科学共识来提升AI政策的质量。

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的兴起，法律判决预测系统开始利用罪犯图像和文本报告，但可能带来意外后果和恶意使用。需要评估VLMs在保释决策中的效能和风险。

Method: 1) 审计VLMs在保释预测任务中的表现；2) 设计干预算法：通过RAG管道引入法律先例；3) 使用创新方案微调VLMs。

Result: 发现VLMs在多个交叉群体中表现不佳，会错误地高置信度拒绝应获保释者。干预措施显著改善了保释预测性能。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在VLMs部署到真实世界法律判决预测前设计更智能的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用具身AI和大视觉语言模型来增强自主无人机对突发事件的适应性和决策能力，替代传统手工编码的安全规则方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全工程师手工编码大量恢复规则，但无法预测现实世界中的各种意外情况，导致规则不完整。需要更智能的适应性决策系统。

Method: 利用具身AI和大视觉语言模型，在Unreal Engine模拟的城市场景中，让无人机动态解释环境并实时生成适当的紧急着陆动作。

Result: 结果表明，具身AI能够实现一类新的自适应恢复和决策流程，这些流程以前无法通过手工设计实现。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了自主航空系统的弹性和安全性，为无人机在突发事件中的实时决策提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

TL;DR: Thinkquel是一个经过微调的模型，用于生成可靠、可移植且执行验证的数据库查询。它集成了新颖的合成数据管道TS-SQL和专门设计的Token-Sequence GRPO强化学习目标，以弥合token级训练信号和序列级执行奖励之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言请求转换为可靠、生产就绪的数据转换仍然具有挑战性：正确性依赖于精确的模式链接和仓库特定的SQL方言，而训练期间最强的监督（执行成功和结果匹配）仅在序列级别提供。同时，组装大型、执行验证的语料库成本高昂，且token级目标与这些全局信号不对齐，导致优化不稳定和可移植性有限。

Method: Thinkquel集成了一个新颖的合成数据管道TS-SQL，利用dbt作为可移植的中间表示，并采用span感知的强化学习目标Token-Sequence GRPO（TS-GRPO），专门设计用于在微调LLMs时弥合token级训练信号和序列级执行奖励之间的差距。

Result: 在500个示例的TS-SQL测试集上，Thinkquel（32B）通过两阶段SFT课程达到93.2%的执行成功率和61.8%的精确结果匹配，相比基础模型提高了67.2%（执行）和44.4%（匹配）。在Spider（14B）实验中，TS-GRPO相对于GRPO和GSPO提高了训练稳定性并加速了执行匹配奖励的收敛。

Conclusion: Thinkquel通过其TS-SQL合成数据管道和TS-GRPO强化学习目标，成功解决了自然语言到SQL转换中的关键挑战，显著提高了执行成功率和结果匹配精度，同时改善了训练稳定性和收敛速度。

linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦微调方法，将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成两个子任务，分别训练专用LoRA适配器，并通过DualTune推理框架实现高效的本机代理编排。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地大语言模型在工具调用场景中表现不佳，需要隐私保护且成本效益高的解决方案，因此需要提升本地模型的工具调用能力。

Method: 采用解耦微调方法，使用LoRA微调为工具选择和工具特定参数生成创建专用适配器，通过分离损失掩码处理两个子任务。

Result: 在MCP-Bench基准测试中，使用解耦微调训练的Qwen-2.5-7B模型将工具调用准确率提高了46%，在大多数情况下优于其他相似规模甚至两倍大小的模型。

Conclusion: 解耦微调和DualTune框架有效提升了本地模型的工具调用性能，为隐私保护和成本效益的代理编排提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MAGIC-MASK框架，将基于扰动的可解释性方法扩展到多智能体强化学习，通过智能体间协作共享掩码状态信息和经验，提高关键状态发现的效率和解释保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习智能体决策过程的可解释性挑战，特别是在安全关键和多智能体环境中，现有方法存在计算成本高、探索覆盖不足和缺乏多智能体适应性的限制。

Method: 集成近端策略优化、自适应ε-贪婪探索和轻量级智能体间协作，通过轨迹扰动、奖励保真度分析和KL散度正则化的统一数学形式化，实现显著性引导的掩码和基于奖励的见解共享。

Result: 在单智能体和多智能体基准测试中验证，包括多智能体高速公路驾驶环境和Google Research Football，在保真度、学习效率和策略鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC-MASK框架成功将可解释性从单智能体系统推广到多智能体系统，提供基于概率建模和多智能体马尔可夫决策过程的局部化、可解释解释，同时提供可转移的解释。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL指南对不同知识领域推理能力的影响，特别是跨域认知能力的变化。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS:20b模型的6个变体（1个基准模型和5种ICL配置），在840个测试中评估通用知识、逻辑谜题和数学奥赛问题的表现。

Result: ICL模型在通用知识任务上达到91%-99%准确率，但在复杂推理问题上性能下降，谜题准确率降至10-43%（基准模型为43%）。数学奥赛问题无显著差异。

Conclusion: ICL指南在效率和推理灵活性之间产生系统性权衡，对LLM部署和AI安全具有重要影响。

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具市场，但工具选择可能存在系统性偏见，这会降低用户体验并扭曲市场竞争，需要评估和解决这种不公平现象。

Method: 构建包含功能等效工具的多样化基准，测试7个模型，通过控制实验分析工具特征、元数据和预训练暴露的影响，并提出基于过滤和均匀采样的缓解方法。

Result: 模型存在不公平性，要么固定选择单一提供商，要么偏好上下文列出的早期工具。语义对齐是最强预测因子，扰动描述会显著改变选择，预训练暴露会放大偏见。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏见是工具增强LLM公平部署的关键障碍，提出的轻量级缓解方法能有效减少偏见同时保持良好任务覆盖。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

TL;DR: CAIA基准测试揭示了AI在对抗性高风险环境中的严重盲点：即使最先进的模型也无法在错误不可逆的对抗环境中有效运作，特别是在加密货币市场等存在主动欺骗的场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在受控环境中评估任务完成度，但现实世界部署需要AI具备对抗主动欺骗的韧性。加密货币市场在2024年因漏洞损失300亿美元，是理想的测试环境。

Method: 使用加密货币市场作为测试平台，评估17个模型在178个时间锚定任务上的表现，要求代理区分真相与操纵、导航碎片化信息环境，并在对抗压力下做出不可逆的财务决策。

Result: 无工具时前沿模型准确率仅28%；工具增强后提升至67.4%，但仍低于80%的人类基线。模型系统性地偏好不可靠的网络搜索而非权威数据，陷入SEO优化的虚假信息和社交媒体操纵。

Conclusion: 当前模型尽管推理分数令人印象深刻，但在需要智能对抗主动反对的环境中仍基本未准备好。对抗性鲁棒性是可信AI自主性的必要条件，CAIA基准为此提供了持续更新的评估框架。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

Motivation: Transformer在逻辑推理方面存在困难，可能是因为缺乏对潜在空间和循环推理等创造性用途的探索，需要深入研究新兴的分层推理模型

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme和Maze-Hard任务上取得了比之前报告显著更好的性能

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了令人惊讶的观察和进一步研究的有趣方向

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Conclusion: 该语义驱动的AI智能体通信框架在动态环境中具有强大的多智能体协作能力，展示了在AI智能体通信网络中的应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

Motivation: 现有智能体基准测试面临新开发的智能体快速达到性能天花板的问题，难以满足评估智能体能力的需求，需要一种可持续演进的评估系统。

Method: TRACE框架包含三个阶段：进化提案挖掘（通过初步探索和发散思维提供任务进化提案）、问题形成与自由探索（将提案概念化为可行问题候选，记录执行轨迹）、多级验证（确保进化任务具有可验证和可复现的轨迹）。

Result: 在GAIA基准上的实验表明，TRACE框架能够持续提升任务复杂度，同时通过可验证的执行轨迹提高正确性的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从静态、手动策划的基准测试向动态、自进化评估系统的范式转变，为智能体开发提供了可持续且具有挑战性的评估环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI回答患者健康问题的黄金标准——人类专家评审——劳动密集且缓慢，限制了可扩展性。自动化指标虽然前景广阔，但与人类判断的契合度不一且通常依赖于上下文。

Method: 在100个患者案例中，收集了28个AI系统的响应（共2800个），并从三个维度进行评估：是否回答问题、是否适当使用临床记录证据、是否使用一般医学知识。使用临床医生撰写的参考答案作为指标锚点。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评分高度匹配，表明精心设计的自动化评估能够有效扩展AI系统的比较评估。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，并支持患者与临床医生之间的沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS)方法，通过语义丰富的状态表示和动作掩码方案，在足球等入侵性团队运动中构建可解释的玩家级智能体模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的分析方法直观但有限，现代机器学习模型虽然能进行模式匹配但缺乏明确的智能体表示。需要构建既能战术可解释又能在异构数据源中稳健的玩家级智能体模型。

Method: EDMS方法通过增强原始位置和速度数据，添加关系变量（如空间得分、传球和得分），并结合动作掩码方案，为持球和无球球员提供不同的决策集。

Result: 与基线相比，EDMS结合动作掩码持续降低了动作预测损失和时序差分误差。定性案例研究和Q值可视化显示EDMS能突出高风险高回报的战术模式。

Conclusion: EDMS方法能够将学习到的价值函数和动作策略映射到人类可解释的战术概念，并与比赛规则对齐，实现了跨数据源的兼容性和可重现实验。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

Motivation: 传统观点认为过程奖励模型(PRM)优于结果奖励模型(ORM)，但这种观点主要基于数学相关领域的证据。本文旨在在多样化领域中统一评估四种奖励模型变体。

Method: 在14个不同领域中对四种奖励模型变体进行统一评估：判别式ORM和PRM(DisORM, DisPRM)以及生成式ORM和PRM(GenORM, GenPRM)。

Result: 发现DisORM与DisPRM表现相当，GenPRM不具竞争力，而GenORM是最稳健的模型，在所有测试领域中都取得了显著且一致的增益。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了细粒度监督总是更好的普遍假设，支持在多领域部署中使用生成式结果验证方法。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}

TL;DR: 提出了VIRTUE视觉交互式文本图像通用嵌入器，通过整合分割模型和视觉语言模型，使嵌入模型能够处理用户指定的感兴趣区域（如点、边界框、掩码），从而提升实体级信息学习和局部化用户意图理解能力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力，无法处理用户指定的感兴趣区域，而生成模型已探索了这种能力。为嵌入模型添加视觉交互不仅能解锁新的应用场景，还能让模型学习图像中的实体级信息来补充全局表示。

Method: 结合分割模型和视觉语言模型，分割模型处理视觉提示以精确定位图像中的特定区域，使嵌入器能更精确地处理复杂和模糊场景。

Result: 在36个通用MMEB任务上性能提升3.1%-8.5%，在5个视觉交互SCaR任务上提升15.2%-20.3%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIRTUE成功将分割模型和视觉语言模型的能力扩展到表示学习领域，为嵌入模型引入了视觉交互能力，显著提升了在复杂场景下的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究通过访谈IT服务公司从业者，为RAG系统开发了15个数据质量维度，涵盖四个处理阶段，发现需要扩展传统DQ框架、在早期阶段加强质量管理，并采用动态的质量管理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据质量框架主要针对静态数据集，无法充分应对RAG系统的动态多阶段特性，需要开发专门针对这类AI系统的数据质量维度。

Method: 对16家领先IT服务公司的从业者进行半结构化访谈，通过定性内容分析归纳出RAG系统的数据质量维度。

Result: 识别出15个不同的数据质量维度，分布在RAG系统的四个处理阶段：数据提取、数据转换、提示与搜索、生成。发现新维度主要集中在早期阶段，且DQ问题会在RAG管道中转化和传播。

Conclusion: 需要扩展传统DQ框架以覆盖RAG环境，采用前置式质量管理策略，并实施动态、分步骤感知的质量管理方法。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

*Shojiro Yamabe,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了扩散语言模型(DLMs)在迭代去噪过程中的关键安全漏洞，攻击者可通过注入肯定性令牌绕过安全防护，并提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法来缓解此漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过并行迭代去噪生成令牌，虽然能降低延迟并支持双向条件，但其推理机制面临的安全风险尚未被充分理解。研究发现DLMs存在关键漏洞，攻击者可通过中间步骤注入肯定性令牌来绕过安全防护。

Method: 提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法，训练模型从包含肯定性令牌的污染中间状态生成安全响应。该方法专门针对DLMs的迭代去噪特性设计。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法能显著缓解该漏洞，对任务性能影响最小，同时提高了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对扩散语言模型进行特定安全研究的必要性，为DLMs的安全防护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

*Minki Kang,Wei-Ning Chen,Dongge Han,Huseyin A. Inan,Lukas Wutschitz,Yanzhi Chen,Robert Sim,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent Context Optimization (ACON)框架，通过优化压缩指南来压缩环境观察和交互历史，减少26-54%的内存使用，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在动态环境中需要积累长历史记录，导致上下文长度增长，增加了成本并降低了长视野任务的效率。

Method: ACON框架在自然语言空间中优化压缩指南：当完整上下文成功但压缩上下文失败时，LLM分析失败原因并更新压缩指南，然后将优化的LLM压缩器蒸馏到更小的模型中。

Result: 在AppWorld、OfficeBench和Multi-objective QA上的实验显示，ACON减少26-54%的内存使用（峰值token），同时基本保持任务性能，蒸馏到更小压缩器时保持95%以上准确率，并将较小LM作为长视野代理的性能提升达46%。

Conclusion: ACON提供了一种有效的上下文压缩方法，能够在减少内存使用的同时保持代理性能，并通过蒸馏技术实现高效部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA是一个自动化科学发现系统，通过文献挖掘识别研究趋势、探索假设设计空间，并基于实验反馈学习奖励模型，生成可行性强、有文献依据的可测试假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动化科学发现工具难以生成既可测试又基于文献的假设，且无法根据先前实验结果进行自适应调整的问题。

Method: 采用受人类研究人员启发的构思流程：文献挖掘识别新兴趋势、探索假设设计空间、通过定位研究空白和论证设计选择来收敛到精确可测试假设，并基于先前实验结果学习奖励模型。

Result: HARPA生成的研究提案在可行性(+0.78)和文献依据(+0.85)上显著优于基线，与ASD代理CodeScientist配合时成功率更高(20 vs 11/40)，失败更少(16 vs 21/40)，奖励模型比未训练基线提升约28%。

Conclusion: HARPA代表了AI驱动科学发现领域的重要进展，能够生成可行且基于文献的可测试假设，并通过学习实验反馈持续改进假设质量。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

*Wei Liu,Haomei Xu,Bingqing Liu,Zhiying Deng,Haozhao Wang,Jun Wang,Ruixuan Li,Yee Whye Teh,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了当前模型编辑方法的脆弱性，指出其成功很大程度上基于利用隐藏捷径而非真实语义，在否定查询下会崩溃，挑战了模型编辑文献的基础可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型不可避免地编码过时或不正确的知识，更新、删除和遗忘这些知识对于对齐、安全等问题很重要。模型编辑通过精确编辑少量参数来更新特定事实同时保留其他知识，但现有方法存在根本性问题。

Method: 系统开发了一套新的评估方法，特别设计了否定查询等负面案例来测试模型编辑的鲁棒性，揭示了隐藏捷径问题。

Result: 研究发现最先进的模型编辑方法在简单的否定查询下就会崩溃，编辑很可能基于捷径而非完整语义，当前文献的成功是虚幻的。

Conclusion: 模型编辑很可能基于捷径而非真实语义，这直接挑战了当前模型编辑文献的基础可行性，需要在进一步推进前重新考虑其基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CDDM方法，通过协作渐进蒸馏技术将高容量教师扩散模型的知识转移到轻量级学生模型，实现实时轻量化的轨迹预测，在保持高精度的同时大幅压缩模型规模和加速采样过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在概率轨迹预测中表现出色，但模型规模大、采样过程慢，阻碍了在自动驾驶和智能交通系统中的实际部署。需要开发实时轻量化的轨迹预测方法。

Method: 基于协作渐进蒸馏(CPD)，逐步将教师扩散模型的知识转移到学生模型，同时减少采样步数和模型规模。引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失，结合教师和真实数据的指导，防止过拟合。

Result: 在ETH-UCY行人基准和nuScenes车辆基准上达到最先进的预测精度。蒸馏后的CDDM在行人轨迹上保留96.2%的ADE和95.5%的FDE性能，仅需231K参数和2-4采样步数，实现161倍压缩、31倍加速和9ms延迟。

Conclusion: CDDM通过将高性能生成模型与实际部署约束相结合，为自动驾驶和智能交通系统实现了资源高效的概率预测。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Expected Attention方法，通过预测未来查询对KV对的关注度来估计重要性，实现无需训练的KV缓存压缩，并发布KVPress库包含20多种技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的内存消耗是大型语言模型推理效率的主要瓶颈，现有基于注意力分数的压缩方法面临未来token注意力分数不可用、现代实现不生成完整注意力矩阵等限制。

Method: 利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭式形式计算每个KV对的期望注意力分数，基于这些分数进行排序和剪枝，最小化对残差流的影响。

Result: 该方法在预填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，在两个场景下均优于现有最优基线，实现有效压缩且无性能下降。

Conclusion: Expected Attention提供了一种无需训练、基于期望注意力预测的KV缓存压缩方法，显著提升推理效率，同时发布的KVPress库为研究者提供了全面的实现和基准测试平台。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch
implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction
loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and
image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By
ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种迭代RZ缩减方法，通过逐步限制搜索区域来减小相关性区域的大小，从而提高策略重用效率和剪枝效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相关性区域(RZ)技术虽然能显著减少搜索空间，但不同解会产生不同大小的RZ，较小的RZ更有利于重用和剪枝效率。

Method: 设计三种约束生成策略，结合RZ模式表，迭代求解同一位置并逐步限制参与区域，引导求解器找到更小的RZ。

Result: 在7x7 Killall-Go实验中，平均RZ大小减少到原来的85.95%。

Conclusion: 缩减后的RZ可作为可重用知识永久存储，适用于更大棋盘或不同开局情况下的求解任务。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

Motivation: 传统强化学习算法（如PPO）在视觉语言模型对齐中存在静态训练计划和刚性裁剪机制的问题，限制了复杂推理任务的性能提升。

Method: 提出ACPO框架：1）动态课程策略，从稳定的近策略探索阶段逐步过渡到高效的离策略利用阶段；2）优势感知自适应裁剪机制，用动态的样本级边界替代固定裁剪超参数。

Result: 在MathVista、LogicVista和MMMU-Pro等基准测试中，ACPO显著优于DAPO和PAPO等基线方法，实现了最先进性能、加速收敛和优越的训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ACPO通过自适应学习策略有效解决了视觉语言模型对齐中的优化挑战，为复杂多模态推理任务提供了更高效和稳定的训练方法。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Result: EvolProver在FormalMATH-Lite上达到53.8% pass@32，在MiniF2F-Test、Ineq-Comp-Seed和Ineq-Comp-Transformed上分别达到69.8%、52.2%和34.0% pass@32，均创下非推理模型的新纪录。

Conclusion: 数据增强流水线在多个基准测试中有效提升了定理证明模型的性能，证明了该方法在增强模型鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: DDIM反演技术使恶意用户能轻松合成虚假内容，现有防御方法因目标与去噪轨迹不匹配而效果有限。

Method: 提出DIA攻击方法，直接攻击DDIM反演轨迹路径，破坏图像编辑过程。

Result: DIA在多种编辑方法中均能有效破坏，性能超越AdvDM和Photoguard等现有防御方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为行业和研究社区提供了实用的AI恶意使用防御方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

careful integration, AI can be a valuable asset in education, provided it is
used to complement rather than replace fundamental learning processes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学信息提取面临数据异质性挑战，现有代理方法在该领域表现有限，需要专门的评估资源。

Method: 构建了10个手工整理并经领域专家验证的数据集，进行广泛基准测试，比较ChatGPT Agent等代理系统和GPT-5等基线模型，并提出了单代理方法控制文档预处理。

Result: 实证发现化学信息提取存在持续挑战，特别是在处理领域特定术语、复杂表格和图示表示以及上下文相关歧义方面。

Conclusion: ChemX基准为推进化学自动化信息提取提供了关键资源，挑战现有方法的泛化能力，并为有效评估策略提供宝贵见解。

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

TL;DR: 比较加权知识库与c-representations两种处理不一致知识库的方法，分析它们在语义层面的等价性和可表达性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在知识库不一致的情况下，需要形式化方法来处理冲突。加权知识库和c-representations都提供了数值化的解决方案，但来自不同研究领域，需要比较它们的语义等价性

Method: 在语义层面比较两种方法：加权知识库通过权重和成本函数，c-representations通过惩罚函数和排序。分析在特定条件下两种方法能否生成相同的解释排序

Result: 证明在特定条件下，加权知识库和一组可废止条件可以生成相同的解释排序，实现语义结构的相对成本等价。同时比较了两种形式主义中的蕴涵关系

Conclusion: 两种方法在语义层面存在等价性，这一发现有助于促进成本语义学和c-representations的进一步研究

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督评估分类器的逻辑框架，通过分析分类器之间的一致性和分歧来推断其性能，无需真实标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当专家（分类器）意见分歧时，我们可以推断他们不可能都完全正确；但当他们完全一致时，无法排除任何可能的评估结果。这种一致性与分歧之间的不对称性激发了无监督评估方法的研究。

Method: 将分类器的对齐决策统计摘要作为输入，构建整数空间中的线性规划问题。使用逻辑约束（如正确响应数不能超过观察响应数）作为不等式，并应用适用于所有有限测试的线性等式公理。

Result: 该方法能够仅基于逻辑一致性进行无监督评估，构建了无需知识的警报系统，可以检测LLM作为评判者是否违反用户指定的最低评分阈值。

Conclusion: 通过形式化分类器无监督评估的逻辑，证明了仅使用逻辑一致性就能实现实际有效的无监督评估，为检测LLM评判者的性能违规提供了实用工具。

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源特别是可再生能源的集成增加，电力系统保护面临重大挑战。基于固定阈值的传统保护方案在动态条件下无法可靠识别和定位短路故障。机器学习提供了有前景的替代方案，但缺乏系统性的模型和设置基准比较。

Method: 使用电压和电流波形数据，将其分割为10毫秒到50毫秒的滑动窗口，在实时约束下评估经典机器学习模型。性能从准确性、窗口大小鲁棒性和运行时效率三个方面进行评估。

Result: 最佳故障分类模型达到F1分数0.992±0.001，最佳故障定位模型达到R2分数0.806±0.008，平均处理时间为0.563毫秒。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在电力系统故障分类和定位方面表现出色，能够在实时约束下提供高精度和效率的保护方案。

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场中Pump and Dump操纵事件稀缺导致的类别不平衡问题严重影响了检测准确性，需要解决这一技术挑战。

Method: 应用SMOTE技术进行数据平衡，并评估多种集成学习模型（包括XGBoost和LightGBM）来区分操纵交易行为与正常市场活动。

Result: SMOTE显著提升了所有模型的P&D事件检测能力，XGBoost和LightGBM分别达到94.87%和93.59%的高召回率，且计算性能快速，适合近实时监控。

Conclusion: 数据平衡技术与集成方法的结合显著改善了操纵活动的早期检测能力，有助于建立更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型数量的激增，如何有效管理和利用这些庞大资源成为一个重要挑战，需要学习能够促进下游任务的紧凑模型能力表示。

Method: 采用项目反应理论框架，将模型正确回答查询的概率建模为三个因素的函数：模型的多技能能力向量、查询的区分度向量和难度标量，并使用混合专家网络联合学习这些参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法在模型路由和基准准确性预测方面达到了最先进的性能，学习到的参数能够编码有意义且可解释的模型能力和查询特征信息。

Conclusion: 基于IRT的方法能够有效学习LLM能力的紧凑表示，在模型管理和性能预测任务中表现出色，且学习到的参数具有良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的评估表明，AIDE能有效发现揭示数据模式的转换和模型。

Conclusion: AIDE为自动化知识发现提供了可扩展的基础框架，未来可集成更多模式提取策略和领域知识。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FusionAdapter是一个用于多模态知识图谱中少样本关系学习的框架，通过适配器模块和融合策略有效整合多模态信息，在少样本场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKG方法主要将不同模态对齐到共享空间，忽视了特定模态的独特贡献，特别是在低资源设置下性能受限。

Method: 提出FusionAdapter框架，包含：(1)适配器模块使每个模态能高效适应未见关系；(2)融合策略整合多模态实体表示同时保留模态特定特征。

Result: 在两个基准MMKG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionAdapter在少样本关系学习任务上优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效适应和融合来自不同模态的信息，FusionAdapter能以最小监督改善对新关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DAIL（Discovered Adversarial Imitation Learning），这是第一个通过元学习发现的对抗模仿学习算法。该方法使用LLM引导的进化框架自动发现数据驱动的奖励分配函数，显著提升了训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗模仿学习（AIL）方法虽然有效，但通常被认为不稳定。现有研究主要关注密度比估计的改进，而奖励分配函数在影响训练动态和最终策略性能方面的作用被严重忽视。奖励分配函数通常基于人类设计的散度最小化目标，缺乏数据驱动的方法。

Method: 采用LLM引导的进化框架，在奖励分配函数空间中进行高效探索，自动发现基于模仿策略性能的数据驱动奖励分配函数。该方法不依赖人类设计，而是通过元学习自动优化奖励分配机制。

Result: DAIL在未见过的环境和策略优化算法上表现出良好的泛化能力，超越了当前最先进的人类设计基线方法。实验表明DAIL能够实现更稳定的训练过程。

Conclusion: DAIL是第一个通过元学习发现的对抗模仿学习算法，证明了数据驱动的奖励分配函数能够显著提升AIL的稳定性和性能。该研究为理解奖励分配函数在AIL稳定性中的作用提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is
publicly available: https://github.com/shshnkreddy/DAIL.

Result: 在随机生成的CVRP实例上，相比现有神经分离方法显著减少了对偶间隙，并成功发现了有效的FCIs

Conclusion: 测试时搜索与随机性结合的方法能有效提升切割平面方法的性能，特别是在识别复杂不等式方面

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

Conclusion: AFFR为罕见病的公平可信联邦诊断提供了一条实用路径，能够在不影响收敛的前提下显著提升系统性能。

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between

TL;DR: SMDS方法自动发现语言模型中的特征流形，揭示概念在潜在空间中的几何结构及其在推理中的作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏泛化性，只能发现特定特征的几何结构，需要一种模型无关的方法来自动发现特征流形

Method: 提出监督多维缩放(SMDS)，一种模型无关的方法，应用于时间推理案例研究

Result: 发现不同特征形成圆、线、簇等几何结构，这些结构稳定、反映概念属性、支持推理并随上下文动态重塑

Conclusion: 特征流形在语言模型中发挥功能作用，支持基于实体的推理模型，语言模型编码和转换结构化表示

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

*Zach Studdiford,Timothy T. Rogers,Kushin Mukherjee,Siddharth Suresh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了70多个不同架构的LLM在概念表示上与人类的对齐程度，发现指令微调和注意力头维度是影响对齐的关键因素，而多模态预训练和参数大小影响有限。现有基准测试无法充分捕捉人类-AI对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的快速发展带来了多样化的计算要素，但尚不清楚哪些要素对构建具有人类类似表示能力的模型最关键。现有基准测试不适合衡量人类与模型之间的表示对齐度。

Method: 使用认知科学中成熟的三元组相似性任务，基于THINGS数据库的概念，评估70多个不同计算要素的模型，比较人类和模型的概念表示。

Result: 经过指令微调的模型和具有更大注意力头维度的模型与人类表示最对齐；多模态预训练和参数大小对对齐度影响有限；现有基准测试（如MMLU）只能部分捕捉表示对齐度。

Conclusion: 指令微调和注意力头维度是推进LLM成为人类概念表示模型的关键计算要素，当前基准测试存在重大不足，需要开发更好的对齐度评估方法。

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

*Akchunya Chanchal,David A. Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的前向传播范式Activation-Deactivation (AD)，通过关闭模型中与遮挡部分对应的组件来消除遮挡输入特征对模型决策的影响，解决了传统黑盒解释方法因遮挡导致分布外图像的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒解释方法依赖遮挡部分输入来生成解释，但这会产生分布外图像，影响解释质量。同时，选择合适的遮挡值需要领域知识，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 提出了ConvAD机制，可以轻松添加到任何训练好的卷积神经网络中，实现AD范式。该方法无需额外训练或微调，通过关闭模型中与遮挡区域对应的组件来生成更鲁棒的解释。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的实验表明，AD解释相比传统遮挡方法在鲁棒性方面有显著提升（最高达62.5%），且无需领域知识就能提取更鲁棒的解释。

Conclusion: ConvAD机制提供了一种更可靠的解释方法，通过AD范式避免了传统遮挡方法带来的分布外问题，提高了解释的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于Curry-Howard对应的理论框架，将CoT推理轨迹转化为形式化证明结构，以验证推理的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT提示增强了LLM的推理能力，但生成推理过程的忠实性仍是模型可解释性的开放问题，需要超越启发式解释的正式验证方法。

Method: 利用Curry-Howard对应关系，将非正式的自然语言CoT步骤映射到形式化的类型化证明结构，通过成功转换为良类型证明来验证计算忠实性。

Result: 开发了从CoT轨迹提取并映射到形式证明的方法，将可信的叙述性解释转化为可形式验证的程序。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更可靠和可信的AI系统提供了路径，实现了从启发式可解释性向形式验证的转变。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: SIRL利用LLM内部的安全直觉作为奖励信号，通过强化学习训练模型信任自身的安全判断，无需外部验证器或人工标注，就能有效防御各种越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏通用标准和安全验证器，难以获得有效的训练信号来确保LLM安全。研究发现对齐模型已具备内部安全信念，在拒绝有害请求时表现出高置信度，这提供了未开发的信号。

Method: 提出Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL)，将模型内部的安全置信度转化为自生成奖励信号，通过强化低熵拒绝行为来训练模型信任自身安全直觉。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上测试，SIRL对20+种越狱方法保持89%+的防御成功率，仅使用15,000个无标注提示就超越了资源密集的监督方法，同时在数学、编程和对话基准上保持性能。

Conclusion: 有效对齐可以从模型内部产生，为无需大量人工监督的自主、鲁棒AI安全机制开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

TL;DR: 提出了一个两层的人本生产规划框架，结合约束规划(CP)和马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)来优化工业制造中的运营效率和劳动力公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业制造中同时优化运营效率和劳动力公平性，将机器能力、处理时间、交期等运营约束与工人偏好、经验、韧性和医疗限制等人因因素整合到生产规划中。

Method: 第一层使用约束规划(CP)进行订单-产线分配，生成高利用率的排程；第二层使用MDP进行工人-产线分配，整合人因因素。比较了贪婪分配、MCTS和RL三种求解策略。

Result: CP排程方法产生紧凑可行的生产计划，延迟率低；MDP工人分配显著提高了公平性和偏好匹配度。领域专家认为两个组件都有效，并提出了改进建议。

Conclusion: 结合CP和学习型决策为人本生产规划提供了稳健方法，能够同时优化吞吐量和劳动力福祉，为公平高效的制造排程提供了实用基础。

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Motivation: 开发一个安全、可审计、低延迟的临床咨询系统，通过领域专家模型提高诊断准确性和计算效率，避免常见事件主导结果。

Method: 使用结构化临床事件标记化，轻量级路由器读取前几个标记并分发到专科模型（心血管、肺、胃肠、肌肉骨骼、精神性），每个专家继承PRISM的小型transformer骨干和标记模板。

Result: 在真实世界急诊科队列中，专家模型在各领域表现出平滑收敛和低开发困惑度，路由器在安全优先策略下实现高路由质量和大幅计算节省。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模安全、可审计、低延迟的临床咨询提供了实用路径，并通过外部/时间复制、非对称生命威胁阈值和多标签仲裁等验证步骤满足前瞻性临床部署标准。

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于供应链风险分析，通过将供应链网络视为知识图谱，结合网络中心性指标进行图遍历检索，并利用上下文模板使定量数据对LLM可理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在处理复杂、多模态金融风险数据时的局限性，标准RAG方法过度简化关系，而专业模型成本高且静态。

Method: 利用网络与知识图谱的二元性，将供应链网络建模为KG，基于网络中心性指标进行图遍历检索；采用智能体架构协调图检索、数值因子表和新闻流数据；使用上下文模板将原始数据转换为自然语言描述。

Result: 该方法能够实时生成简洁、可解释且上下文丰富的风险叙述，无需昂贵的微调或专用图数据库。

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法有效提升了LLM在金融风险分析中的能力，特别是针对供应链风险评估场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在证明通过精心设计的训练方法而非单纯扩大模型规模，可以在有限计算资源下实现前沿水平的多模态推理能力，使更多组织能够使用先进AI技术。

Method: 采用渐进式三阶段方法：1）深度扩展提升推理能力；2）分阶段持续预训练，先建立基础文本和视觉理解，再通过合成数据增强视觉推理；3）高质量文本监督微调，包含显式推理轨迹。

Result: 在Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index上获得52分，与DeepSeek-R1-0528相当但计算资源需求更少；在10个图像基准测试中平均性能仅比Gemini-2.5-Flash和Claude Sonnet-3.7低5分。

Conclusion: 精心设计的中期训练可以显著缩小能力差距而无需大规模扩展，使前沿多模态推理对基础设施有限的组织变得可及，模型已开源发布。

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching
DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all

TL;DR: Bridge方法通过重新设计批量LLM隐藏状态为整体张量而非独立切片，在并行生成多个响应时让它们相互依赖，仅需少量新参数就能显著提升响应质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并行LLM推理中，多个响应独立生成，浪费了计算资源和响应间的潜在有用信息，这与序列生成中利用历史计算的效率形成对比。

Method: 将批量LLM隐藏状态重新构想为整体张量而非独立切片，使并行响应生成相互依赖，仅添加少量新参数（2.8%-5.1%）。

Result: Bridge将可验证奖励强化学习的相对平均准确率提升高达50%，并提高了正确响应的一致性。一次训练即可扩展到任何生成宽度，性能始终优于独立生成。

Conclusion: Bridge解锁了一种更通用的并行扩展模式，有效利用序列间信息，且与任何后生成聚合技术兼容。

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

Conclusion: 为RAG开发者提供了构建更稳健测试套件的关键工具，从而提高系统可靠性，并可扩展到识别未对齐文档等应用场景。

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

Motivation: 当前最先进的机器学习原子间势能模型通过等变神经网络架构强制旋转平移对称性，这种硬编码的归纳偏置通常会导致灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性降低。

Method: 引入TransIP：基于Transformer的原子间势能，通过优化嵌入空间表示来指导通用非等变Transformer模型学习SO(3)等变性，无需显式架构约束。

Result: 在OMol25数据集上，TransIP在机器学习力场方面达到与最先进等变基线相当的性能，相比数据增强基线，在不同数据集规模下性能提升40%到60%。

Conclusion: 学习等变性可以成为等变或基于数据增强的MLIP模型的有力且高效替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口对于处理长距离依赖任务至关重要，但RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合会导致精度下降，需要系统分析和解决方案。

Method: 提出Q-ROAR方法：将RoPE维度分组为少量频带，对Key和Query权重进行轻量级的逐频带缩放搜索，使用插值压力和尾膨胀比作为诊断指标，无需微调或架构更改。

Result: Q-ROAR将长上下文工作负载的困惑度降低了14%以上，同时保持了短上下文性能、推理吞吐量和现有LLM系统栈的兼容性。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR有效解决了RoPE位置插值与量化结合时的精度问题，为量化LLM的长上下文支持提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on

performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

### [165] [Linear Regression in p-adic metric spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00043)
*Gregory D. Baker,Scott McCallum,Dirk Pattinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了在p-adic度量空间中进行机器学习的理论框架，证明了p-adic回归与欧几里得回归的关键差异，并通过自然语言处理应用展示了p-adic度量在处理层次数据中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器学习问题常涉及层次化数据，但传统欧几里得度量无法捕捉层次关系的离散分支特性，需要更适合的数学框架。

Method: 建立了p-adic度量空间的理论基础，证明了n维平面最小化p-adic距离时必须通过至少n+1个数据点，这与欧几里得回归形成鲜明对比。

Result: 主要理论结果：最小化p-adic距离的n维平面必须通过至少n+1个数据点；n次多项式最小化p-adic残差必须通过至少n+1个点；多项式逼近会产生具有不同有理根的差值多项式。

Conclusion: p-adic度量可能是正确处理机器学习中层次数据结构的基础，在层次数据中，选择实际观测点作为代表比插值更有意义。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align是一个联邦学习框架，利用预训练大语言模型作为通用特征提取器，解决表格数据异构性问题，在保持隐私的同时实现高性能和通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感领域很有吸引力，但表格数据的异构性（不同客户端间的模式差异和不兼容特征空间）阻碍了直接聚合。

Method: 将表格记录序列化为文本，使用DistilBERT、ALBERT、RoBERTa和ClinicalBERT等LLM提取语义对齐的嵌入表示，在标准FedAvg协议下支持轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在冠状动脉疾病预测任务中，所有客户端设置和LLM骨干网络下都优于最先进基线，F1分数提升高达+0.25，通信成本降低65%，在极端模式差异下表现稳健。

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align为异构环境中的联邦学习提供了一个鲁棒、隐私保护且通信高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

Motivation: 许多真实世界序数数据在某些解释变量值下会出现非单峰的条件概率分布，而现有的单峰似然模型对此存在偏差，需要开发更灵活的模型来缓解这种偏差。

Method: 开发近似单峰似然模型，能够表示单峰条件概率分布以及接近单峰的分布，提供比严格单峰模型更大的灵活性。

Conclusion: 近似单峰似然模型能够更好地适应真实序数数据的分布特性，在保持单峰结构优势的同时缓解了严格单峰模型的偏差问题。

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

TL;DR: 提出NeurTransformer方法，通过将transformer模型转换为脉冲神经网络(SNN)，解决传统transformer模型在计算时间和空间上的二次复杂度问题，实现更高的能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer模型在训练和部署时面临计算挑战，时间空间复杂度与输入序列长度呈二次关系。现有SNN训练方法效率低，转换方法延迟高，需要更高效的SNN transformer设计方法。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：1) 用脉冲自注意力(SSA)替换自注意力机制；2) 将训练好的transformer前馈块转换为等效SNN；3) 使用SNN代理学习算法微调SSA块。

Result: 在GPT-2小模型上测试，转换后的模型余弦相似度损失5-12%，困惑度降低9.7%。SSA块相比ASA块能效显著提升，在数字硬件上实现自注意力机制时能耗降低64.71%-85.28%。

Conclusion: NeurTransformer方法成功实现了transformer到SNN的高效转换，在保持性能的同时显著提升了能效，为大规模transformer模型的部署提供了可行的SNN解决方案。

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

Motivation: 人类通过比较多样化观察来学习概念，这种认知机制对机器恢复数据背后的真实概念同样重要。尽管概念学习在实证上取得了成功，但缺乏通用理论支持。

Method: 开发一个多类观察下概念可识别性的理论框架，通过类间充分多样性来识别隐藏概念，无需特定假设。即使条件不全局满足，也能基于局部比较提供替代保证。

Result: 理论验证表明，在类间多样性足够的情况下，隐藏概念可以被识别，且类与概念之间的隐藏结构也能非参数地识别。

Conclusion: 比较机制为概念学习提供了理论基础和正确性保证，扩展了理论在更灵活场景下的适用性，并在合成和真实世界设置中得到验证。

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了强化学习中奖励选择问题（RLLF）的正式化框架，研究在有限反馈下如何选择最有价值的样本进行奖励标注，以最大化策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际问题中，获取大量奖励标签通常不可行，特别是在依赖人类反馈时。当强化学习必须在有限反馈下进行时，需要确定哪些样本应该被标注奖励才能最大化策略性能。

Method: 研究两种奖励选择策略：(i) 依赖无奖励信息的启发式方法（如状态访问和部分价值函数），(ii) 使用辅助评估反馈预训练的策略。

Result: 发现关键的奖励子集是那些能够引导智能体沿着最优轨迹前进，并在偏离后支持恢复到接近最优行为的奖励。有效的选择方法能够用显著少于完全监督的奖励标签获得接近最优的策略。

Conclusion: 奖励选择是在反馈受限环境中扩展强化学习的有力范式，能够显著减少所需的奖励标注数量。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

Motivation: AI决策系统在关键领域的广泛应用引发了对算法公平性的担忧。由于通常只能访问算法输出而无法了解其内部机制，研究社区提出了反事实公平性度量，但如何从可用数据评估这些度量仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用部分识别方法，从观测数据中推导反事实公平性度量的信息性边界，并引入贝叶斯方法以高置信度约束未知的反事实公平性度量。

Result: 在COMPAS数据集上的实验显示，将种族改为非裔美国人会对COMPAS分数产生正向（虚假）效应，而从年轻到年老的转变则会产生负向（直接因果）效应。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理反事实公平性度量的不可识别性问题，为评估算法公平性提供了实用的工具。

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Method: 逆向工程分析成功学习乘法的模型，使用logit归因和线性探针，引入预测"运行和"的辅助损失。

Result: 发现模型通过注意力构建有向无环图来缓存和检索成对部分乘积，使用Minkowski和和傅里叶基表示数字，标准微调模型缺乏这些机制。

Conclusion: 通过逆向工程揭示了Transformer学习长程依赖的陷阱，正确的归纳偏置可以解决这一问题。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA通过动态剪枝和灵活秩分配，显著提升了LoRA的表达能力，为参数高效微调提供了更优解决方案

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法缺乏明确的奖励或评论家模型，限制了其在token序列上进行细粒度信用分配的能力，需要改进RL微调中的信用分配机制。

Method: 通过token级对数概率重新表述资格迹来近似λ-return学习，并引入无评论家的时序差分误差近似，提出了几种λ-return加权变体。

Result: 在1.5B到7B参数的模型上，相比GRPO在RL训练期间性能提升30-40%，在多个数学推理基准测试上平均性能提升超过3分，7B模型提升4.5分。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

TL;DR: 提出了RouterArena平台，用于全面比较LLM路由器的性能，包含构建的数据集、难度分级、评估指标和自动化框架，并建立了首个路由器排行榜。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生态系统模型多样，没有单一最优模型，路由器选择变得重要但困难，需要标准化比较平台。

Method: 构建RouterArena平台，包含广泛知识领域的数据集、难度分级、多种评估指标和自动化更新框架。

Result: 建立了首个LLM路由器排行榜，提供了详细的指标比较。

Conclusion: RouterArena是首个开放的LLM路由器比较平台，将很快向公众开放，有助于解决路由器选择难题。

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

*Zhanda Zhu,Qidong Su,Yaoyao Ding,Kevin Song,Shang Wang,Gennady Pekhimenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAFusion是一个高效的LoRA微调系统，通过图分割融合内存受限操作和自适应批处理算法，解决了现有LoRA系统的内存访问冗余和多任务并发微调效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA微调系统存在两个关键低效问题：一是由于大型激活张量的冗余内存访问导致运行时开销大；二是无法在相同GPU上并发微调多个共享基础模型的独立LoRA适配器，错失了减少流水线气泡、改善通信重叠和GPU负载平衡等性能提升机会。

Method: 在核心层面提出图分割方法融合内存受限操作，消除不必要的内存访问；在调度层面引入自适应批处理算法，将LoRA适配器分组并解决装箱问题以生成平衡的、依赖感知的微批次。

Result: 相比Megatron-LM实现了最高1.96倍（平均1.47倍）的端到端加速，相比最先进的多LoRA微调系统mLoRA实现了最高1.46倍（平均1.29倍）的改进。融合核心实现了最高1.39倍（平均1.27倍）的性能提升。

Conclusion: LoRAFusion通过核心级和调度级的优化，显著提升了LoRA微调效率，可作为即插即用的替代方案在现有LoRA系统中使用。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at
https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Directed-MAML算法，通过任务导向的一阶近似来估计二阶梯度效应，解决MAML在元强化学习中计算开销大和收敛困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAML在元强化学习中面临两个主要挑战：二阶梯度计算导致的计算和内存开销大，以及嵌套优化结构使收敛到全局最优更困难。

Method: 在二阶梯度步骤前应用额外的任务导向一阶近似来估计二阶梯度效应，从而加速收敛并降低计算成本。

Result: 在CartPole-v1、LunarLander-v2和两车交叉路口场景中，Directed-MAML在计算效率和收敛速度上优于MAML基线方法。

Conclusion: 任务导向近似可有效集成到其他元学习算法中，如FOMAML和Meta-SGD，提高计算效率和收敛速度。

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thoughtbubbles是一种transformer变体，通过在潜在空间中学习分叉或删除残差流来执行并行自适应计算，使需要大量计算的token能在网络中间形成"气泡"进行额外思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于显式思维链token的推理时计算扩展方法存在局限性：无法在预训练阶段应用，且仅限于串行生成的自然语言表达。

Method: 提出Thoughtbubbles方法，让transformer在潜在空间中学习分叉或删除残差流，实现并行自适应计算。关键特性是仅使用语言建模损失在预训练阶段学习这种行为。

Result: 在OpenWebText和peS2o困惑度评估中，Thoughtbubbles优于标准解码器语言模型和非自适应并行计算方法。在HellaSwag和LAMBADA等零样本评估中也表现更好，参数规模从1.5亿到7.72亿均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法的隐式特性使得自适应计算可以从预训练阶段开始学习，为统一训练和测试时推理模型行为铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

TL;DR: KV缓存压缩虽然能提高吞吐量，但在多指令提示等实际场景中可能导致某些指令被完全忽略，特别是系统提示泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究KV缓存压缩在实际部署中的潜在问题，特别是在多指令提示场景下可能导致的指令忽略现象。

Method: 识别KV缓存压缩的陷阱，分析压缩方法、指令顺序和KV驱逐偏差对提示泄漏的影响，提出改进的KV缓存驱逐策略。

Result: 发现某些指令在压缩下性能急剧下降，系统提示泄漏问题严重，压缩方法、指令顺序和KV驱逐偏差都会影响泄漏程度。

Conclusion: KV缓存压缩存在实际部署风险，需要改进驱逐策略来减少多指令任务中的性能影响。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

Motivation: 科学机器学习虽然能够从高维时空流数据中提取物理洞察，但在潜空间中实现可解释性仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 基于神经算子构建确定性自编码框架，通过编码神经算子进行空间粗化压缩，解码神经算子进行空间细化重建，并在潜空间中集成可微PDE求解器。

Result: 在2D圆柱绕流、2D对称狭窄动脉流和3D患者特异性冠状动脉流等基准问题上验证了DIANO在维度和几何约简潜空间中求解PDE的能力。

Conclusion: DIANO能够在促进维度和几何约简的潜空间中求解PDE，同时保持潜空间的可解释性。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效计算小批量中每个样本梯度统计信息的方法，通过自动微分图手术实现，几乎不增加计算和内存开销。研究揭示了在优化算法中正确放置非线性操作的重要性，并挑战了关于Adam预处理器设计的传统认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习训练算法将小批量样本视为单一对象，只计算平均梯度，而忽略了每个样本的梯度统计信息。作者认为计算这些统计信息在自动微分框架中并非资源密集，且能带来新的算法设计可能性。

Method: 通过自动微分图手术实现梯度统计计算，在某些情况下几乎不增加计算和内存开销。对于transformer等模型，使用JAX的向量化变换进行实现。研究了signSGD中sign操作的最佳位置和Adam预处理器中均值与方差的作用。

Result: 发现signSGD中sign操作的位置对性能至关重要，可通过信噪比预测最佳位置。在Adam预处理器中，优化效果最好时预处理器应由梯度分布的均值而非方差主导，这与传统认知相反。

Conclusion: 每个样本的梯度信息为算法设计提供了新的分析和可能性，挑战了优化算法中非线性操作设计的传统观点。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了监督微调(SFT)泛化能力差而强化学习(RL)泛化能力强的传统观点，通过系统实验证明：通过引入提示多样性和思维链监督，SFT可以实现与RL相当的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视SFT与RL泛化能力的对比，反驳SFT只能记忆训练数据而无法泛化的普遍观点，探索如何通过数据策略提升SFT的泛化能力。

Method: 在两个决策基准(Sokoban和General Points)上系统评估，引入提示多样性训练和思维链监督作为算法支架，结合两者实现最优泛化。

Result: 提示多样性打破了固定模板的捷径依赖，思维链监督显著提升到更困难任务的迁移能力，两者结合在指令变体和难度变体设置下都实现了鲁棒泛化，匹配或超越RL基线。

Conclusion: SFT并非天生劣于RL，通过适当策划的训练数据，简单的SFT可以实现与RL相当的强泛化能力，支持数据中心的视角。

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing
the results in the paper can be found at:

Motivation: 显微镜技术产生大量复杂图像数据，需要发现更简单、可解释的表示形式来揭示底层物理结构。VAE是构建此类低维表示的有力工具，但其性能依赖于多个设计选择，通常需要通过试错和经验分析来优化。

Method: 使用基于奖励的策略评估潜在空间表示，以压电力显微镜数据为模型系统，研究多种策略和奖励函数。通过GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间来构建奖励函数。

Result: 分析表明，使用GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间能够构建有效的奖励函数，可以估计模型效率并指导寻找最优的简约表示。

Conclusion: 基于奖励的策略为VAE工作流程的自动化和无偏优化提供了基础，GMM和BGMM是构建有效奖励函数的强有力工具。

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Motivation: 受编码计算范式启发，将其应用于机器学习，设计高效正则化机制以鼓励更平滑的表征和更可泛化的解决方案。

Method: 设计coded-smoothing模块，可无缝集成到监督和无监督训练流程中，处理数据的线性组合而非原始输入，实现正则化。

Result: 在监督和无监督任务上的广泛实验表明，coded-smoothing能持续提升泛化能力，并在基于梯度的对抗攻击下达到最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: coded-smoothing是一种有效的正则化方法，可提升模型泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性，且计算开销最小。

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 现有研究发现循环网络擅长状态跟踪但难以处理回忆任务，而Transformer擅长回忆但无法将状态跟踪能力扩展到更长序列。受这两种架构互补优势的启发，研究是否能在混合模型中同时保留这两种能力。

Method: 构建集成循环和注意力组件的混合模型，并提出延迟注意力层训练的训练策略来缓解Transformer组件对捷径解决方案的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，延迟注意力层训练的方法使混合模型在比训练时长三倍的混合序列上达到接近完美的准确率（>90%）。

Conclusion: Transformer组件对捷径解决方案的依赖是阻碍长度泛化的关键障碍，延迟注意力层训练是一种简单有效的策略，能显著提升混合模型的长度泛化性能。

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于能量的变分潜在先验（EVaLP）方法，通过将先验建模为能量模型来解决VAE中的"先验空洞"问题，同时使用变分方法绕过昂贵的MCMC采样，实现高效生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决变分自编码器（VAE）中存在的"先验空洞"问题，即先验分布中高概率区域在后验分布中概率较低，导致生成样本质量差的问题。

Method: 将先验建模为能量模型（EBM），使用变分方法处理归一化常数，通过采样器网络近似变分形式，采用交替优化训练先验，生成时采样器简化为隐式变分先验。

Result: 与多个SOTA基线相比，EVaLP在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和采样效率方面均有提升。

Conclusion: EVaLP方法成功解决了VAE的先验空洞问题，在保持生成效率的同时提高了样本质量。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: SLogic是一个新颖的知识图谱补全框架，通过为逻辑规则分配查询相关的动态置信度分数，利用查询头实体周围的子图上下文来评估规则重要性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逻辑规则方法将规则视为通用的，为每个规则分配固定置信度分数，忽略了查询特定上下文。但实际上规则的重要性会因查询而异，这是一个重要限制。

Method: 提出SLogic框架，核心是一个评分函数，利用查询头实体周围的子图来动态评估每个规则的重要性，为逻辑规则分配查询相关的分数。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，通过利用局部子图上下文，SLogic在知识图谱补全任务上持续优于最先进的基线方法，包括基于嵌入和基于规则的方法。

Conclusion: SLogic通过引入查询相关的规则评分机制，有效解决了传统逻辑规则方法忽略查询上下文的问题，显著提升了知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including

*Shutong Wu,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Freedave是一种针对扩散大语言模型的无损并行解码算法，通过候选生成和验证的流水线设计，在不引入额外模型前向计算的情况下，将推理吞吐量提升至2.8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然具有双向注意力机制的优势，但在推理效率上不如自回归模型，且现有并行解码算法会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Freedave算法，采用并行解码的候选生成和验证流水线，保证生成序列与静态采样相同。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，DLLMs的吞吐量提升至2.8倍，且无性能损失。

Conclusion: Freedave成功解决了DLLMs推理效率低的问题，实现了无损的并行解码加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ACT-ViT为LLM生成的文本幻觉检测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，支持跨模型应用和零样本泛化。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在非平稳环境中存在可塑性丧失问题，即模型未来学习能力下降，这限制了其在持续学习场景中的应用。

Method: 基于动力系统理论，通过识别参数空间中的稳定流形来形式化定义可塑性丧失，分析激活饱和导致的冻结单元和表示冗余导致的克隆单元流形两种主要机制。

Result: 研究发现低秩表示和简单性偏差等促进静态泛化的特性会直接导致持续学习中的可塑性丧失，并通过数值模拟验证了理论分析。

Conclusion: 揭示了静态泛化与持续学习可塑性之间的基本张力，探讨了架构选择或针对性扰动作为潜在缓解策略。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了联邦推理鲁棒性分析的空白，为构建安全的联邦推理系统提供了理论基础和实践方案。

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

TL;DR: DiSC-AMC是一种高效的自动调制分类方法，通过离散化统计特征、修剪示例列表和优化提示模板，在减少计算资源的同时保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LLM在自动调制分类中提示上下文过长和模型规模过大的问题，实现实际部署中的高效推理。

Method: 将高阶统计量和累积量离散化为符号标记，通过轻量级神经预过滤器修剪示例列表，使用从先前LLM响应中提取的理性过滤误导特征，并通过校准提示模板强制执行仅标签预测。

Result: 在10种调制类型的合成AMC噪声测试中，使用约50亿参数的Gemini-2.5-Flash模型达到45.5%准确率，相比70亿参数的DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen基线（5.2%准确率）显著提升，同时将推理成本降低2倍以上。

Conclusion: 精心设计的离散化和上下文选择可以在保持基于提示的AMC优势的同时，显著降低推理成本，实现实际闭环使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

TL;DR: DecepChain是一种新型后门攻击范式，通过引导LLM生成看似良性的推理过程但最终得出错误结论，利用模型自身的幻觉并强化错误推理，具有高度隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM依赖思维链进行推理判断，但这种信任基础存在脆弱性。攻击者可能诱导模型生成看似合理但实际错误的推理过程，且不留明显痕迹，这种隐蔽风险尚未被充分探索。

Method: 利用LLM自身幻觉，通过微调模型在自然错误推理上，然后使用GRPO策略优化结合翻转奖励和流畅性正则化，强化错误推理但保持推理过程看起来良性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上，DecepChain实现了高攻击成功率，同时在良性场景下性能下降最小。人类评估显示难以区分被操纵的推理过程与良性推理。

Conclusion: 这种隐蔽的失败模式可能悄悄破坏LLM答案并削弱人类对LLM推理的信任，迫切需要未来研究解决这一警示性风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Abstract: The exponential growth of internet generated data has fueled advancements in
artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) for
extracting actionable insights in marketing,telecom, and health sectors. This
chapter explores ML applications across three domains namely healthcare,
marketing, and telecommunications, with a primary focus on developing a
framework for optimal ML algorithm selection. In healthcare, the framework
addresses critical challenges such as cardiovascular disease prediction
accounting for 28.1% of global deaths and fetal health classification into
healthy or unhealthy states, utilizing three datasets. ML algorithms are
categorized into eager, lazy, and hybrid learners, selected based on dataset
attributes, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) scores. For validation, eight datasets from the
three sectors are employed in the experiments. The key contribution is a
recommendation framework that identifies the best ML model according to input
attributes, balancing performance evaluation and model complexity to enhance
efficiency and accuracy in diverse real-world applications. This approach
bridges gaps in automated model selection, offering practical implications for
interdisciplinary ML deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 残差连接虽然稳定了Transformer的训练，但破坏了表示的层次结构。本研究旨在探索是否可以在不改变标准架构的情况下，无需残差连接就能稳定训练Transformer。

Method: 通过分析无残差连接Transformer块的雅可比矩阵，揭示了残差连接改善条件数的机制，并设计了一种原则性的初始化策略来恢复其稳定化效益。

Result: 在监督和自监督的视觉Transformer上验证了该方法，无残差连接的ViT克服了优化障碍，学习了更丰富的层次表示，在密集预测基准上超越了包含残差连接的强基线。

Conclusion: 残差连接不是训练ViT的基本要求，这为视觉模型中的层次表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策预训练变换器(DPTs)在超出预训练数据分布时泛化能力不足，需要解决离线预训练中的泛化限制问题。

Method: 引入上下文好奇心正则化器，在PPT框架中通过辅助奖励预测器，使用预测误差作为内在好奇心信号来鼓励训练期间更广泛的探索。

Result: 在高斯多臂老虎机概念验证实验中，PPT显示出改进的鲁棒性：当测试环境奖励方差较高且预训练数据多样性有限时，PPT缓解了DPT中观察到的性能下降。

Conclusion: 虽然离线数据质量仍然是基础，但初步结果表明好奇心驱动的预训练为增强上下文强化学习智能体的分布外泛化能力提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMDPs比标准MDPs更复杂，因为不存在适用于所有初始状态分布的通用最优策略，每当初始分布变化时都需要重新求解CMDP。

Method: 使用CMDPs的对偶分析和线性规划中的扰动分析来推导最优值随初始分布变化的界限。

Result: 推导出了CMDPs最优值随不同初始分布变化的界限，并展示了如何用这些界限分析策略遗憾。

Conclusion: 该研究为处理CMDPs中初始分布变化提供了理论工具，能够分析因初始分布未知变化导致的策略性能下降。

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质结构标记化方法依赖于难以优化和扩展的定制组件，需要开发更简单有效的标记化方法。

Method: 使用扩散自编码器结合流匹配损失，用全局坐标替代基于框架的表示，用标准注意力替代SE(3)-不变注意力操作。

Result: 该方法训练更稳定，在重建指标上优于现有标记器，模型规模更小且训练成本更低。自回归模型在生成性能上优于基于标记的类似模型。

Conclusion: Kanzi简化了蛋白质结构标记化，实现了参数高效且性能优越的模型，为多模态蛋白质建模提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成框架主要在连续空间中运行且多为单目标指导，而离散方法缺乏多目标帕累托最优性保证，需要开发能同时优化多个冲突目标的离散序列设计方法。

Method: 基于Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi)，结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，偏置采样朝向帕累托最优状态同时保持分布不变性。

Result: 在肽和SMILES序列设计中同时优化多达五个治疗特性（亲和力、溶解度、溶血性、半衰期和非污染性），优于进化和扩散基线方法。

Conclusion: AReUReDi为多特性生物分子生成建立了强大的序列基础框架。

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

Result: 简化后的注意力机制在持续学习场景中显著改善塑性保持和遗忘问题，性能优于基线方法

Conclusion: 完整注意力对于在持续学习中捕获元学习益处可能不是必需的，基于查询的模型有助于保持塑性

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

steep learning curve of such endeavors, a problem exacerbated by a fragmented
literature where key results are scattered across numerous papers. In
particular, we synthesize this disparate body of findings into a curated set of
recipes that demonstrate how to implement everything from basic arithmetic in
feed-forward layers to complex data routing via self-attention. Our mise en
place of formulations is for both newcomers seeking an accessible entry point
and experts in need of a systematic reference. This unified presentation of
transformer constructions provides a foundation for future work spanning
theoretical research in computational complexity to empirical investigations in
architecture design and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将LLM符号程序生成与数值参数优化分离的混合方法，通过引入额外的参数优化层来提高控制策略搜索的效率和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在生成符号控制策略时无法分离功能结构和数值参数，导致搜索过程缓慢低效

Method: 将LLM生成程序中的数值参数提取出来进行数值优化，LLM迭代程序功能结构，同时使用单独的优化循环寻找候选程序的局部最优参数集

Result: 在控制任务上实现了更高的回报和改进的样本效率，相比纯LLM引导的搜索表现更好

Conclusion: 符号程序合成与数值优化相结合可以产生可解释且高性能的策略，弥合了语言模型引导设计与经典控制调优之间的差距

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

Result: 在大多数图分类基准数据集上达到高准确率，优于主流图学习方法如GNNs，并能提供高质量的解释。

Conclusion: GDLNN在保持高准确性的同时提供了可解释性，且包含解释成本在内的总体成本较低。

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

TL;DR: 验证了一种贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法，在虚拟环境中进行工作记忆任务测试，同时控制空间负载和特征绑定负载两个变量，与传统单变量自适应方法相比效果相当但能揭示更多个体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知实验通常只控制单一变量并用标量总结性能，需要发展多变量自适应实验设计方法来更全面地评估认知能力。

Method: 使用高斯过程概率分类器的贝叶斯方法，在虚拟环境中进行5×5工作记忆重建任务，同时控制空间负载L（占用瓦片数）和特征绑定负载K（不同颜色数），通过后验不确定性指导刺激获取。

Result: 与传统自适应阶梯方法在K=3时具有可比性（组内相关系数0.755），自适应模式能更快收敛（约30个样本即可准确拟合完整模型），并揭示空间负载与特征绑定之间的个体差异。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯双轴自适应方法在保持与传统方法相当性能的同时，能更高效地获取多维认知特征，揭示个体差异，为认知评估提供更全面的工具。

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

<details>

Motivation: 混合模型架构结合不同计算原语已显示出超越Transformer的潜力，但现有研究手动探索设计空间，由于设计空间大和训练成本高，发现适合预训练的混合模型具有挑战性

Method: 开发Composer框架，在小规模探索模型架构，通过提出的缩放策略将表现最佳的架构外推到更大规模

Result: 发现的新混合LLM架构在350M-3B参数规模上验证损失持续降低，下游任务准确率提升达2.8-8.3%（平均1.1-3.1%），同时提升训练和推理效率

Conclusion: Composer框架能够有效发现高性能混合模型架构，在多个规模上超越现有基线，为模型架构设计提供了系统化方法

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法为概率张量网络学习提供了一种高效且数值稳定的解决方案，显著提升了可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 需要从噪声、不规则采样的轨迹中学习物理一致的连续时间动力学，同时获得哈密顿量的不确定性量化。

Method: 在哈密顿量表面H上放置GP先验，将可变步长多步积分器约束编码为有限线性泛函，实现向量场和哈密顿量表面的闭式条件化，无需隐状态。

Result: 在质量-弹簧、Van der Pol和Duffing基准测试中展示了改进的向量场恢复和良好校准的哈密顿量不确定性。

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP能够通过设计强制执行能量平衡和被动性，同时提供向量场和哈密顿量的可靠估计。

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

*Ayush Jain,Andrea Montanari,Eren Sasoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据选择方法，通过反转训练集和验证集的角色，在验证集上微调前后对训练池进行推理，选择预测变化最大的样本，从而更有效地选择对目标分布有益的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法将目标样本作为验证集，通过单样本增减来估计效果，但这种方法效率较低。当目标分布只有少量样本可用时，需要更简单快速的数据选择方法。

Method: 反转训练和验证的角色：在验证集上微调前后对训练池进行推理，选择预测变化最大的样本。核心洞察是：在小型验证集上微调后预测变化最大的训练样本，往往对减少目标分布上的测试损失最有益。

Result: 在指令调优和命名实体识别任务上的实验表明，在大多数情况下，该方法比现有最优方法实现了更低的测试对数损失。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过反转训练和验证的角色，提供了一种更简单快速的数据选择策略，能够有效识别对目标分布最有益的训练样本，并通过理论分析支持了这一发现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Method: 使用深度潜在变量模型(DLVM)整合多个执行功能任务和个体的观察数据，结合动态自适应学习引擎(DALE)进行最优自适应采样

Result: DLVM在数据量较少时显著优于IMLE，收敛更快；DALE在前80次试验中优于随机采样和固定测试组合

Abstract: Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive
function tasks and individuals, allowing parameter estimation even under sparse

under with smaller amounts of data, and converges faster to highly accurate

adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random

TL;DR: 提出Graph2Region(G2R)方法，将节点表示为封闭区域，通过区域重叠近似最大公共子图(MCS)，使用不相交部分作为图编辑距离(GED)的代理，同时计算两种相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络方法在计算图相似度时存在昂贵节点对比较或无法有效利用图结构信息的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将节点表示为嵌入空间中的封闭区域，捕捉图结构和规模信息，通过区域重叠计算MCS相似度，通过不相交部分计算GED相似度。

Result: 在MCS相似度学习上相对准确率提升60.0%，训练和推理效率高，能同时预测MCS和GED相似度。

Conclusion: G2R方法在计算图相似度方面表现出色，提供全面的图相似度评估，代码已开源。

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对单层Mamba模型的训练动态和上下文学习泛化能力进行了理论分析，证明Mamba通过线性注意力层选择信息丰富的上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在计算效率上优于Transformer模型，并在多种语言任务中表现相当，但其理论理解因非线性门控机制而受限。本文旨在从理论上分析Mamba的上下文学习能力。

Method: 分析单层Mamba模型（包含线性注意力组件和非线性门控层）的训练动态，并与线性Transformer在相同设置下进行比较分析。

Result: Mamba利用线性注意力层选择信息丰富的上下文示例，通过非线性门控层抑制异常值影响。虽然Mamba可能需要更多训练迭代才能收敛，但在异常值比例超过线性Transformer容忍阈值时仍能保持准确预测。

Conclusion: Mamba模型在上下文学习中具有鲁棒性，能够有效处理包含异常值的提示，这一理论发现得到了实证实验的支持。

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NC-Iso是一种新颖的GNN架构，通过保持节点根子树中特征的相对位置来解决子图匹配中的尺度差异问题，并引入相似性主导比增强度量来提高匹配对的排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN方法在子图匹配中存在两个主要问题：1）编码过程中图对之间的尺度差异，因为只关注特征计数而忽略了节点根子树中特征的相对位置；2）铰链距离度量对匹配图对缺乏区分能力，影响排序应用。

Method: NC-Iso通过构建节点根子树中相邻层级之间的层次依赖关系来保持特征的相对位置，确保匹配图对在特征计数上保持一致的层次结构。同时引入相似性主导比增强度量来量化图对之间相似性相对于不相似性的主导程度。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实证结果表明，NC-Iso在保持时间效率的同时，具有有效性、泛化能力、可扩展性和可迁移性，为子图检索提供了更具区分性的神经子图匹配解决方案。

Conclusion: NC-Iso通过解决尺度差异问题和增强排序能力，提供了一种更有效的神经子图匹配方法，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

TL;DR: 提出了一个从字典学习推导稀疏自编码器(SAE)的理论框架，通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法，揭示了现有SAE变体的局限性，并提出新的AbsTopK SAE变体来解决双向概念表示问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏理论推导框架，且其稀疏正则化器强制非负性，阻碍了单个特征表示双向概念（如男性vs女性），导致语义轴分裂为冗余特征。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法，推导出常见SAE变体，并提出AbsTopK SAE——基于ℓ0稀疏约束，对最大幅度激活进行硬阈值处理，保留正负激活。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个探测与引导任务上的实验表明，AbsTopK提高了重建保真度、增强可解释性，使单个特征能够编码对比概念，性能匹配甚至超过需要标注数据的监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过保留双向激活，发现了更丰富的双向概念表示，解决了现有SAE的结构性限制，在无监督设置下达到了监督方法的性能水平。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

Motivation: 现有的零阶方法依赖手工设计的静态采样策略，无法适应模型特定结构。观察到实践中广泛采用的基础模型数量有限，为给定LLM学习一次优化器并在不同下游任务中重用是可行且高效的。

Method: 设计了一种学习型零阶优化器，支持每个LLM一次性训练，通过紧凑内存高效的设计自动学习扰动策略，将学习到学习（L2L）扩展到基础模型时代。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个数据集上的实验表明，ZO Fine-tuner在82.1%的任务-模型组合中优于先前的零阶基线方法。

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner展示了强大的性能和可扩展性，为高效LLM微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical

TL;DR: PromptLoop是一个基于强化学习的插件式框架，通过多模态大语言模型在扩散模型采样过程中迭代更新提示，实现有效的奖励优化和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于强化学习的扩散模型微调在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励攻击方面的不足，探索提示优化作为模块化替代方案。

Method: 训练多模态大语言模型使用强化学习，基于扩散模型的中间潜状态迭代更新提示，而不是修改扩散模型权重。

Result: 在多样化奖励函数和扩散骨干网络上，PromptLoop实现了有效的奖励优化、对未见模型的泛化、与现有对齐方法的正交组合，并减轻了过优化和奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: PromptLoop通过将潜在反馈融入逐步提示优化，在保持提示对齐灵活性的同时，实现了与Diffusion RL类似的结构类比，提供了有效的模块化对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

TL;DR: SADA是一种样本感知的动态数据增强方法，通过根据样本对模型优化的影响动态调整增强强度，解决了传统固定或随机增强方法在动态训练环境中与模型需求不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据增强方法使用固定或随机变换，但样本难度会随着模型泛化能力的变化而演变。不加区分地应用增强会导致增强数据与模型训练需求不匹配，从而降低训练效果。

Method: 通过将样本梯度投影到累积模型更新方向并计算局部训练窗口内的时间方差来估计每个样本的影响。低方差样本（稳定影响）增强更强以强调多样性，不稳定样本增强更温和以保持语义保真度和稳定学习。

Result: 在各种基准数据集和模型架构上的实验显示SADA带来一致改进，包括细粒度任务上+7.3%和长尾数据集上+4.3%的提升。

Conclusion: SADA是一种轻量级、即插即用的方法，无需辅助模型或策略调优，能有效提升训练效果并具有实用价值。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Motivation: 神经网络训练中存储层激活的内存需求带来了显著的可扩展性挑战，需要内存高效的梯度重构方法。

Method: 采用控制理论矩阵草图技术，使用三个互补的草图矩阵通过指数移动平均和自适应秩调整来草图层激活。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和物理信息神经网络上的实证评估展示了可控的精度-内存权衡，并在MNIST上实现了实时梯度范数跟踪。

Conclusion: 草图激活存储为内存高效的神经网络训练和分析提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

TL;DR: UrbanGraph是一个物理信息框架，通过异构动态时空图整合关键物理过程，用于城市微气候预测，在R²指标上提升10.8%，计算量减少17.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着快速城市化，预测城市微气候变得至关重要，因为它影响建筑能耗需求和公共健康风险。现有生成方法和同构图方法在捕捉物理一致性、空间依赖性和时间变异性方面存在不足。

Method: 引入UrbanGraph框架，集成异构和动态时空图，编码植被蒸散、遮阳和对流扩散等关键物理过程，同时建模不同城市实体间的复杂空间依赖关系及其时间演化。

Conclusion: 该数据集为时空微气候建模提供了首个高分辨率基准，该方法可扩展到更广泛的城市异构动态计算任务。

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous
and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes --
vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督张量异常检测方法能有效处理时空数据中的异常，同时考虑异常的稀疏性和时空平滑特性，并提供统计置信度。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TimeEmb框架，通过静态-动态分解方法解决时间序列中的非平稳性问题，将时间序列分解为时间不变和时间变化两个互补组件，提升预测性能并减少计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列的非平稳性（分布随时间变化）给可靠预测带来挑战。现有方法往往将时间变化和时间不变组件混在一起学习，导致面对分布变化时性能不佳。

Method: TimeEmb框架包含：1）时间不变组件，通过全局嵌入模块学习跨时间序列的持久表示；2）时间变化组件，采用频域滤波机制处理，灵感来自信号处理中的全频谱分析。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，TimeEmb优于现有最先进方法，且需要更少的计算资源。定性和定量分析验证了静态-动态解耦的有效性。

Conclusion: TimeEmb是一个轻量级框架，能有效解决时间序列非平稳性问题，通过静态-动态分解提升预测性能，并可简单集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at
https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需记忆缓冲区和任务边界的在线持续学习方法，通过结合提示学习和NCM分类器有效解决灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线持续学习方法要么使用记忆缓冲区存储样本（可能引发数据安全和隐私问题），要么依赖任务边界信息（在单次数据处理中难以识别），因此需要研究无需记忆缓冲区和任务边界的在线持续学习。

Method: 将提示学习与NCM分类器相结合，在不存储样本且不使用任务边界或身份信息的情况下处理灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的广泛实验结果证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了在线持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需记忆缓冲区或任务边界信息。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 经验神经正切核（eNTK）的特征分析可以揭示训练后神经网络使用的特征，在玩具模型和模块化加法任务中能恢复真实特征，并能诊断grokking相变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过eNTK分析来发现神经网络使用的特征，并检测模型训练过程中的相变现象。

Method: 在两个标准玩具模型（TMS和模块化加法）上分析eNTK的频谱特性，通过特征值分析识别特征空间。

Result: eNTK显示出尖锐的频谱悬崖，其顶部特征空间与真实特征对齐；在TMS中能恢复稀疏和密集机制下的真实特征；在模块化算术中能恢复傅里叶特征族；层间eNTK能将特征定位到特定层；eNTK特征谱演化能诊断grokking相变。

Conclusion: eNTK分析为特征发现和小模型中相变检测提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)来诊断持续学习中的捷径特征问题，发现CL方法在包含虚假捷径特征的任务中表现出适应性延迟和性能缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常利用捷径特征（输入与标签间的偶然相关性），这会削弱鲁棒性。在持续学习中，捷径特征的影响会持续并加剧，导致模型过度依赖历史特征而阻碍新技能学习。

Method: 引入ERI诊断指标，包含三个可解释维度：适应性延迟(AD)、性能缺陷(PD)和相对次优特征依赖(SFR_rel)。在CIFAR-100 CL基准测试中，在第二阶段故意添加虚假的洋红色补丁作为捷径特征。

Result: CL方法比从头训练基准更早达到准确率阈值（负AD），但在包含捷径特征的类别上最终准确率稍低（正PD）。屏蔽补丁后CL方法准确率提升而基准下降，产生负SFR_rel，表明补丁对CL模型是干扰而非帮助。

Conclusion: 在持续学习中，捷径特征主要作为干扰项而非有用捷径，CL方法表现出对历史特征的过度依赖，阻碍了新任务的学习能力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

TL;DR: DVD是一种基于潜在扩散模型的源自由域自适应框架，通过扩散网络将目标特征转换为源域风格的表示，实现无需源数据访问的决策边界迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型主要关注生成任务，其在判别性迁移方面的潜力尚未充分探索。源自由域自适应面临无法访问源数据的核心挑战。

Method: 在源域训练阶段，将每个源特征的标签信息编码到其潜在邻域中，通过高斯先验和扩散网络训练。在适应阶段，从目标特征的潜在邻域采样，使用冻结的扩散模块生成源域风格线索，通过InfoNCE损失对齐目标编码器。

Result: 在标准SFDA基准测试中，DVD优于最先进方法。相同的潜在扩散模块还能提升源分类器在域内数据的准确性，并在监督分类和域泛化实验中提升性能。

Conclusion: DVD将潜在扩散模型重新解释为实用、保护隐私的显式知识迁移桥梁，解决了源自由域自适应中先前方法未能解决的核心挑战。

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

Conclusion: CPFM方法有效解决了黑盒时间序列域适应问题，利用基础模型克服时空动态特性，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

Motivation: 研究LLM推理应该采用分离模块还是单模型统一架构，探索双架构潜在推理中如何改进潜在通信效果。

Method: 测试两个假设：增加通道容量和通过联合微调学习通信，在GPT-2和Qwen-3上使用匹配的潜在令牌预算进行比较，并设置统一软嵌入基线。

Result: H2（联合微调）表现最强，H1（增加通道容量）增益有限；统一基线几乎匹配H2且超越H1；扩展潜在令牌预算未能提高鲁棒性；潜在分析显示子空间重叠且专业化有限。

Conclusion: 双模型潜在推理在理论上仍有潜力，但需要设计能够明确塑造潜在空间以支持算法规划的目标和通信机制。

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习或直接反向传播的扩散对齐方法在最大化奖励时，常常面临奖励过优化和模式崩溃的问题，需要一种能同时保持多样性的优化方法。

Method: DAV框架将扩散对齐建模为变分期望最大化过程：E步使用测试时搜索生成多样化且奖励对齐的样本；M步使用E步发现的样本精炼扩散模型。

Result: 在连续和离散任务（文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计）中，DAV能够优化奖励同时保持多样性。

Conclusion: DAV框架通过变分期望最大化的迭代过程，有效解决了扩散对齐中的奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题，在多种任务中实现了奖励优化与多样性的平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究微分注意力在提高任务相关焦点同时，是否引入了对抗性攻击的脆弱性，揭示选择性注意力和鲁棒性之间的权衡。

Method: 通过理论分析识别负梯度对齐机制，并在ViT/DiffViT和预训练CLIP/DiffCLIP上进行系统实验，涵盖五个数据集，评估攻击成功率、梯度对立和局部敏感性。

Result: 微分注意力相比标准注意力具有更高的攻击成功率、频繁的梯度对立和更强的局部敏感性；深度实验显示在较小扰动下通过噪声消除提供保护，但在大攻击预算下保护减弱。

Conclusion: 微分注意力在干净输入上改善判别焦点，但增加了对抗性脆弱性，需要在未来注意力机制中同时考虑选择性和鲁棒性设计。

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

### [233] [Spectral Scaling Laws in Language Models: How Effectively Do Feed-Forward Networks Use Their Latent Space?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00537)
*Nandan Kumar Jha,Brandon Reagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型中前馈网络(FFN)的宽度选择问题，将其重新定义为频谱利用问题，发现软秩随FFN宽度呈幂律增长，而硬秩仅呈次线性增长，表明增加宽度主要添加低能量尾方向，而主导模式子空间早期饱和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律关注模型大小与损失的关系，但忽略了组件如何利用其潜在空间。作者希望研究FFN的宽度选择问题，量化不同模型中潜在方向的有效激活程度。

Method: 使用轻量级诊断套件：硬秩(参与比)、软秩(香农秩)、频谱集中度和复合频谱利用指数(SUI)，在LLaMA、GPT-2和nGPT系列模型上量化有意义的潜在方向激活情况。

Result: 发现不对称频谱缩放定律：软秩随FFN宽度几乎完美遵循幂律，而硬秩仅呈次线性增长且方差较大。在更大宽度下，方差进一步坍缩到狭窄子空间中，导致大部分潜在空间未被充分利用。

Conclusion: 将FFN宽度选择重新定义为尾容量与主导模式容量之间的权衡，为推理高效的大型语言模型设计提供具体指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种机器学习模型（线性回归、回归决策树、随机森林）在预测预期寿命方面的表现，发现随机森林模型具有最高的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测预期寿命对公共卫生和经济社会发展至关重要，但由于人口、环境和医疗因素的复杂相互作用，这仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用WHO和UN的真实数据集，评估线性回归、回归决策树和随机森林三种模型，通过R²、MAE和RMSE指标评估性能，并分析特征重要性。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳（R²=0.9423），显著优于其他模型。免疫接种率（白喉、麻疹）和人口属性（HIV/AIDS、成人死亡率）是关键预测因子。

Conclusion: 集成方法与可解释性的结合能有效应对公共卫生挑战。未来研究应探索更先进的插补策略、替代算法和更新数据以进一步提高预测精度。

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

TL;DR: 研究发现RL训练中LLM参数更新具有两个关键特性：秩1主导性和秩1线性动态，基于此提出了AlphaRL加速框架，可在保持96%以上性能的同时实现2.5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习推动了LLM推理能力的显著提升，但RL训练过程中的参数动态变化机制仍不清楚，需要深入理解以改进训练效率。

Method: 通过分析8个LLM和7种算法的实验，识别出RL诱导参数更新的两个基本属性：秩1主导性和秩1线性动态，并基于这些发现开发了AlphaRL加速框架。

Result: 实验验证了这两个属性的普适性，AlphaRL框架实现了2.5倍训练加速，同时保持了96%以上的推理性能，无需额外模块或超参数调优。

Conclusion: 这些发现为大规模RL训练提供了原则性、可解释且高效的训练范式，开启了LLM训练的新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析揭示了状态空间模型(SSMs)的学习动态，发现记忆精度与长度之间存在权衡，并提出改进的训练策略：使用最长的初始记忆结构，以及固定循环权重可以获得更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型显示出超越Transformer的潜力，但缺乏对其学习动态的理论解释，限制了对其高性能机制的理解和改进。

Method: 通过分析输入时间序列如何存储在状态中来评估SSMs的记忆容量，建立S4模型与简化对角循环权重模型的等价性，并基于理论分析提出改进训练策略。

Result: 理论分析揭示了记忆精度与长度的权衡关系，实验证明延长记忆很困难，初始化至关重要。固定循环权重比自适应权重能获得相当或更好的性能，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 研究为SSMs提供了新的理论基础，并可能提供一种新颖的优化策略，强调初始参数的重要性以及固定循环权重的优势。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

TL;DR: PANORAMA通过机器学习驱动的正交变换解决ANNS验证瓶颈，将90%以上信号能量压缩到前半维度，实现早期候选剪枝和部分距离计算，在保持召回率的同时获得2-30倍端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ANNS系统在最终精炼阶段花费高达99%的查询时间计算距离，存在严重的验证瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用数据自适应的学习正交变换，结合层级主内存布局、SIMD向量化部分距离计算和缓存感知访问模式，无需修改现有索引结构。

Result: 在多种数据集（CIFAR-10、GIST、OpenAI Ada 2和Large 3等）上实验表明，PANORAMA实现了2-30倍的端到端加速，且无召回损失。

Conclusion: PANORAMA通过机器学习方法有效解决了ANNS系统的验证瓶颈问题，显著提升了查询效率。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

TL;DR: 本文改进了私有在线学习问题，针对具有有限Littlestone维度的概念类，提出了新算法：在可实现设置下达到O_d(log T)的错误界（对抗自适应对手），在不可知设置下达到Õ_d(√T)的次线性遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作[Golowich and Livni, 2021]证明了具有有限Littlestone维度的概念类在可实现设置下是可私有在线学习的，但他们的算法对自适应对手只能达到Õ_d(√T)的错误界，存在优化空间。

Method: 提出新的私有在线学习算法，针对可实现设置和不可知设置分别设计，利用概念类的Littlestone维度特性来保证差分隐私。

Result: 在可实现设置下，新算法对自适应对手达到O_d(log T)的错误界；在不可知设置下，对一般Littlestone类达到Õ_d(√T)的次线性遗憾界。

Conclusion: 证明了具有有限Littlestone维度的概念类在可实现和不可知设置下都是可私有在线学习的，填补了先前工作中的性能差距。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

TL;DR: Eyes-on-Me是一种模块化的RAG数据投毒攻击方法，通过可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域分解对抗性文档，实现低成本的目标适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的数据投毒攻击扩展性差，需要为每个目标短语优化投毒文档，成本高昂。

Method: 将对抗性文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域，吸引器优化用于引导注意力到焦点区域，可在其中插入检索器语义诱饵或生成器恶意指令。

Result: 在18个端到端RAG设置中，攻击成功率从21.9%提升到57.8%（+35.9个百分点，比先前工作高2.6倍），单个优化的吸引器无需重新训练即可迁移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器。

Conclusion: 该方法建立了可扩展的RAG数据投毒范式，表明模块化、可重用组件对现代AI系统构成实际威胁，同时揭示了注意力集中与模型输出之间的强关联。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经天气模型(NWMs)会产生校准不良的概率预报，而标准的校准度量指标如ECE无法有效捕捉不同降水阈值下的校准误差。

Method: 引入了期望阈值校准误差(ETCE)度量指标，并扩展了计算机视觉中的后处理技术，采用选择性缩放和提前时间条件化来改善模型校准。

Result: 选择性缩放结合提前时间条件化能够在不降低预报质量的情况下有效减少模型的校准误差。

Conclusion: ETCE是评估降水预报校准性能的更好指标，所提出的后处理方法能够显著改善神经天气模型的概率校准质量。

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

Motivation: 现有方法仅利用因果图信息设计模糊集，忽略了结构方程信息。为了平衡保守性和准确性，需要包含更现实的概率分布。

Method: 引入结构因果最优传输及其模糊集，提出松弛版本用正则化项替代复杂因果约束，通过凸差规划实现高效求解。

Result: 方法能有效处理维度诅咒，实现维度无关的快速收缩，在结构信息缺失时仍保持有效性并提供有限样本保证。

Conclusion: 结合结构方程信息能显著增强模糊集的现实性，松弛算法提供高效求解，方法在理论和实际应用中都表现出优势。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

Motivation: 在推荐系统等实际应用中，多个学习智能体需要在保证安全约束的前提下平衡探索与利用，避免灾难性失败。

Method: 设计了MA-SCLUCB算法，采用交替的动作选择和共识构建阶段，智能体仅与直接邻居通信，确保每轮期望奖励不低于基线策略的(1-α)倍。

Result: 算法实现了$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$的遗憾界，其中协作带来$1/\sqrt{N}$的改进，通信开销仅对数增长。

Conclusion: 在合理连接的网络中，具有安全保证的分布式学习能够达到接近最优的性能。

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数数据的无限维特性使得表示学习具有挑战性，传统统计模型依赖预选基展开或核函数限制了数据驱动的灵活性，而深度学习通常将函数视为固定网格向量忽略了内在连续性。

Method: FAME框架结合双向神经控制微分方程与混合专家驱动的向量场来形成连续注意力，捕捉函数内连续性；使用多头交叉注意力融合函数间依赖关系的变化。

Result: 在合成和真实世界函数回归基准测试中，FAME实现了最先进的准确性，对任意采样的函数离散观测具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAME提供了一个完全数据驱动的函数对函数回归框架，能够有效处理函数数据的连续性和依赖关系，在精度和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

TL;DR: EF21-Muon是首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效、非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和双向压缩，在NanoGPT实验中实现了7倍通信节省且无精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如Muon、Scion、Gluon虽然通过层间线性最小化预言器(LMO)在非欧几里得范数球上优化，但缺乏分布式框架，通信瓶颈未解决，且现有分布式变体都是启发式的，没有收敛保证。

Method: 提出EF21-Muon，支持随机梯度、动量和双向压缩的错误反馈，首次将错误反馈扩展到非欧几里得设置，当关闭压缩并选择特定范数时可恢复Muon/Scion/Gluon。

Result: 理论分析涵盖非欧几里得光滑和更一般的(L^0, L^1)-光滑设置，匹配已知最佳欧几里得速率，在合适范数选择下实现更快收敛。NanoGPT实验显示相比未压缩的Muon/Scion/Gluon实现7倍通信节省且无精度损失。

Conclusion: EF21-Muon提供了这一强大优化器家族的首个高效分布式实现，解决了通信瓶颈问题，同时保持了理论收敛保证。

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Motivation: 物理信息机器学习在岩土工程中具有潜力，需要开发能够结合物理原理和实测数据的有效方法来分析隧道开挖对桩基的影响。

Method: 将桩基建模为欧拉-伯努利梁，周围土体建模为Pasternak地基，形成四阶常微分方程作为物理信息组件，实测数据作为数据驱动组件，通过最小二乘法训练极限学习机网络。

Result: 验证表明PIELM方法准确可靠，监测数据应布置在桩顶/桩端和隧道开挖区域附近等桩身变形梯度显著的位置。应用实例证明了该方法在土-桩相互作用分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在桩基实时监测和安全评估方面具有巨大潜力，有助于岩土工程智能预警系统的发展。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

Conclusion: 通过比较多种ML算法并采用One vs Rest方法，成功构建了优化的组合模型用于数字发展干预文档分类。研究强调了除数据量外，特征相似性在分类任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepFHT将深度神经网络与随机过程理论中的首次击中时间分布相结合，构建了一个基于物理意义的生存分析框架，在保持预测准确性的同时提供可解释的参数化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生存分析方法如Cox回归依赖比例风险假设，缺乏物理基础的可解释性。DeepFHT旨在结合随机过程理论和深度学习，提供既准确又可解释的生存分析模型。

Method: 将事件时间建模为潜在扩散过程首次到达吸收边界的时间，使用神经网络将输入变量映射到物理意义参数（初始条件、漂移、扩散），基于布朗运动等FHT过程获得闭式生存和风险函数。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，DeepFHT的预测准确性与最先进方法相当，同时保持了基于物理的可解释参数化，能够阐明输入特征与风险之间的关系。

Conclusion: DeepFHT成功地将随机过程理论与深度学习相结合，为复杂系统中的生存现象建模提供了原则性途径，在准确性和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

TL;DR: TD-JEPA是一种基于时间差分学习的无监督强化学习方法，通过预测潜在空间中的长期动态来学习通用表示，支持零奖励函数的测试时优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的潜在预测方法通常局限于单任务学习、单步预测或在线轨迹数据，而时间差分学习能够从离线、无奖励的转移中学习跨多个策略的长期潜在动态表示。

Method: TD-JEPA训练显式的状态和任务编码器、策略条件化的多步预测器以及直接在潜在空间中参数化的策略集合，利用TD学习构建潜在预测表示。

Result: 在ExoRL和OGBench的13个数据集上，TD-JEPA在运动、导航和操作任务上匹配或超越了最先进的基线方法，特别是在像素级零样本强化学习这一挑战性场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: TD-JEPA通过TD学习实现了无监督强化学习中的长期潜在动态预测，理论分析表明其能避免表示坍塌并学习低秩策略动态因子分解，实验证明其在零样本强化学习中具有优越性能。

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Motivation: 研究时间序列基础模型的有效性，探讨其在零样本预测和微调后的性能是否如语言和视觉基础模型那样具有优越性。

Method: 使用预测作为下游任务，评估时间序列基础模型的零样本能力和微调后的性能，并与专用小模型进行比较。

Result: 时间序列基础模型的零样本能力受预训练领域影响显著，微调后在未见真实数据上性能不总是优于专用小模型，且参数和内存开销更大。

Conclusion: 时间序列数据的多样性使得构建有效的基础模型更具挑战性，当前时间序列基础模型在预测任务中的优势有限。

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Conclusion: LEAP编码作为图表示学习流程的强大组件具有潜力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

Result: 实验表明，使用降级优化器（如零阶方法）能收敛到更难扰动的损失盆地，显著提高遗忘鲁棒性，混合优化器在保持遗忘效果的同时增强了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 优化器的选择对LLM遗忘鲁棒性至关重要，降级优化器策略能有效抵抗后训练扰动，混合优化器方法在MUSE和WMDP基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的交互范式——原位反馈，用户直接编辑LLM的先前响应，模型基于修改后的响应生成修订，相比传统多轮反馈在推理密集型任务中表现更好且token使用减少79.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反馈范式依赖发送新消息，LLM难以可靠整合这些反馈，导致改进不一致。需要更有效的机制来指导LLM在推理密集型任务中的表现。

Method: 引入原位反馈范式，用户直接编辑LLM的先前响应，模型基于这个修改后的响应生成修订版本，而不是依赖新的消息反馈。

Result: 在多样化推理密集型基准测试中，原位反馈比传统多轮反馈表现更好，同时使用token减少79.1%。控制环境分析显示原位反馈解决了多轮反馈的核心限制。

Conclusion: 原位反馈为引导LLM在推理密集型任务中提供了更自然有效的机制，能更精确地应用反馈到错误部分，避免引入新错误。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Motivation: 复杂系统产生的模式多样性可用于科学或艺术目的，但参数空间巨大且参数与模式间存在强非线性映射。艺术家和科学家在探索时通常有特定期望模式，这给探索过程带来新挑战。

Method: 提供设计选择和实现方案，通过系统无关的显式约束表达用户感兴趣区域，以样本高效的方式最大化约束多样性。

Result: 实现了交互式系统探索，能够在保持全局多样性的同时，在用户感兴趣区域内发现多样化的模式。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了复杂系统探索中的挑战，通过约束表达用户期望，实现了约束多样性的最大化探索。

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of
the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to

Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware
mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This
approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic

Conclusion: 该研究建立了社交媒体平台算法干预与多臂老虎机理论之间的重要联系，为解决在线意见动态管理问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

Conclusion: 该方法在增强利用能力的同时不牺牲多样性，通过动态平衡探索和奖励驱动指导，有效解决了GFlowNets在大型稀疏奖励空间中的采样挑战。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot
generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to
continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFG使用大而静态的权重虽然能提升感知质量，但会导致分布对齐变差。为了更好近似目标条件分布，需要学习动态的引导权重。

Method: 学习连续函数形式的引导权重ω_{c,(s,t)}，作为条件c、去噪起始时间t和目标时间s的函数。通过最小化真实条件分布与引导扩散过程样本间的分布不匹配来实现。

Result: 在低维玩具示例和高维图像设置中均有效，图像生成FID指标得到改善。在文本到图像应用中，使用CLIP分数作为奖励函数能改善图像-提示对齐。

Conclusion: 动态引导权重方法能有效平衡感知质量和分布对齐，在扩散模型中实现更好的条件分布近似。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

Conclusion: CAPO通过曲率感知的优化方法有效解决了策略梯度优化的稳定性问题，为可扩展的后训练提供了可靠基础

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，所提方法实现了更低的累积遗憾和更快的收敛速度，比使用通用OpenAI嵌入模型的基线方法具有更好的鲁棒性和性能-成本平衡。

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

Motivation: 开发可信赖的人工智能需要超越黑盒性能指标，理解模型的内部计算机制。机械可解释性旨在识别模型行为的算法机制，但其科学严谨性依赖于发现的可靠性。

Method: 将可解释性方法视为统计估计器，通过输入重采样、提示改写、超参数变化和因果分析中的注入噪声等受控扰动，对EAP-IG方法进行方差和鲁棒性评估。

Result: 在多种模型和任务上的结果表明，EAP-IG表现出高结构方差和对超参数的敏感性，质疑了其发现的稳定性。

Conclusion: 建议该领域常规报告稳定性指标，以促进更严谨和基于统计的可解释性科学。

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题或数据收集限制导致的微观样本中一个或多个属性信息缺失的挑战，为不完整数据的人口合成提供稳健解决方案。

Method: 使用掩码矩阵表示缺失值，提出WGAN训练算法，让模型能够从包含缺失信息的训练数据集中学习，并与完整数据训练的WGAN模型进行对比。

Conclusion: 该方法为不完整数据的人口合成提供了稳健解决方案，开辟了未来研究的新途径，并突显了深度生成模型在提升人口合成能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis
capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文深入分析了基于分类器的质量过滤方法，发现虽然它能提升下游任务性能，但并不能改善在高质量数据集上的语言建模能力，因为该方法会隐式过滤高质量数据集本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型在混合质量的网络爬取数据上预训练，数据过滤至关重要。基于分类器的质量过滤方法被广泛使用，但其有效性需要深入分析。

Method: 分析基于分类器的质量过滤方法，比较其与通过随机标记排列获得的合成数据训练模型的行为差异。

Result: CQF能提升下游任务性能，但不能改善在高质量数据集上的语言建模；与合成数据训练模型的行为趋势截然不同。

Conclusion: CQF并不捕捉有意义的数据质量概念，挑战了该方法捕获数据质量的普遍观点。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用条件表格生成对抗网络(CT-GAN)直接或与FBS-CO混合方法来生成目标人口的有效性，发现独立CT-GAN模型表现最佳，但混合方法相比传统FBS-CO有所改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统确定性人口合成方法在处理高维数据、可扩展性和零单元问题方面面临挑战，特别是在为目标场景生成人口时。

Method: 使用CT-GAN深度生成模型直接基于边际约束生成目标人口，或通过混合方法将CT-GAN与FBS-CO结合。

Result: 独立CT-GAN模型表现最佳，能生成符合单变量分布的逼真群体，但在保持多变量关系方面存在困难。混合模型相比FBS-CO有所改进。

Conclusion: CT-GAN是生成目标人口的有效方法，深度生成模型与传统合成技术的结合能提升性能。

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GreenLightningAI (GLAI) 是一种新的架构模块，通过分离结构知识和定量知识来替代传统MLP，在保持通用逼近能力的同时减少约40%的训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP在训练过程中结构知识和定量知识相互纠缠，这限制了训练效率。GLAI旨在分离这两种知识以实现更高效的训练过程。

Method: GLAI将MLP重新表述为路径组合，一旦激活模式稳定就固定结构，只优化定量组件（权重和偏置）。

Result: 在多种实验设置中，GLAI在保持相同参数量的情况下，准确率与MLP相当或更高，且收敛速度更快，平均训练时间减少约40%。

Conclusion: GLAI确立了一个新的设计原则，可以作为通用模块替代MLP，未来有望集成到Transformer等大规模架构中。

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Motivation: 研究不同损失函数对强化学习性能的影响，特别是传统使用的均方误差是否是最佳选择，以及是否存在更适合控制策略次优性差距的预测目标。

Method: 理论分析不同预测目标（平均绝对误差和均方误差）对策略次优性差距的影响，并实证比较不同损失函数（交叉熵损失和平方损失）在线性强化学习中的表现。

Result: 理论证明平均绝对误差在控制策略次优性差距方面优于均方误差，实证结果显示使用交叉熵损失的算法在线性强化学习中表现优于基于平方损失的算法。

Conclusion: 损失函数的选择对强化学习性能有重要影响，交叉熵损失与平均绝对误差的组合比传统的平方损失与均方误差组合能带来更好的性能表现。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: BoMGene方法在基因表达数据分析中具有明显优势，特别适用于多类基因表达数据分析

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene
expression data analysis

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于均值的强化学习方法（如GRPO）存在熵崩溃和推理增益有限的问题，原因是过度关注高概率输出序列而忽略罕见但信息丰富的推理路径。

Method: 提出RiskPO方法，使用混合Value-at-Risk目标整合奖励分布的多个区域，并设计捆绑方案将多个问题聚合，丰富反馈信号。

Result: 在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成基准测试中，RiskPO在Pass@1和Pass@k指标上均显著优于GRPO及其变体。

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为增强LLM推理能力提供了严谨有效的范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种校正算法来处理验证器不可靠性问题：后向校正通过去偏观测的二元奖励来恢复无偏策略梯度估计；前向校正通过重加权分数函数项使期望更新方向与干净梯度对齐，仅需假阴性率。


<details>

Motivation: 为了避免昂贵的人工标注，使用自动验证器的强化学习系统通常将奖励二值化为{0,1}，但这会引入假阴性（拒绝正确答案）和假阳性（接受错误答案）问题。

Method: 将验证器建模为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道，提出后向校正和前向校正两种算法，并在基于GRPO的RLVR流水线中实现为轻量级钩子。

Conclusion: 通过轻量级LLM验证器在线估计假阴性率的实用上诉机制，相比其他最先进方法取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在生成结构化思维链时缺乏对安全对齐的批判性推理能力，容易在有缺陷前提注入时产生偏见。

Method: 使用混合合成生成的反对齐思维链预填充和标准提示进行强化学习训练，无需额外训练成本或修改标准RLHF方法。

Result: 显著提高安全性和越狱鲁棒性，减少过度拒绝，保持核心推理能力，同时维持推理令牌预算。模型更频繁进行自我反思，在自适应攻击下保持稳健。

Conclusion: RECAP方法有效提升了模型的安全对齐能力，使其能够在面对有缺陷推理时保持安全响应，同时不损害推理性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

Motivation: 传统认为GRPO需要大组规模以确保稳定训练，但这带来了巨大的计算开销。本文旨在探索最小化组规模的可能性，以显著降低计算成本。

Method: 将GRPO重新框架为对比学习形式，揭示其与DPO的基本联系，并研究仅使用2个rollout的2-GRPO配置。

Result: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，但仅使用1/8的rollouts，训练时间减少超过70%。

Conclusion: 2-GRPO是可行的，能够显著降低计算成本而不牺牲性能，为LLM后训练提供了更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为S-SWIM的新算法，通过将随机特征方法从人工神经网络适配到脉冲神经网络，实现了无需近似脉冲函数梯度的端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络作为更节能的机器学习模型受到关注，但其脉冲机制的非可微性和稀疏性使得基于梯度传播的训练方法非常困难。

Method: 将随机特征方法从人工神经网络适配到脉冲响应模型脉冲神经网络，提出S-SWIM算法进行端到端训练，无需近似脉冲函数梯度。

Result: S-SWIM在时间序列预测中达到高准确率，可作为独立策略或梯度训练前的有效初始化策略，性能优于随机权重采样。

Conclusion: S-SWIM为脉冲神经网络训练提供了一种数据驱动、快速、高性能且可解释的解决方案，克服了传统梯度方法的训练困难。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在医疗筛查等成本敏感场景中，如何在保证分类准确率的同时减少昂贵诊断测试的使用，平衡测试成本与分类准确性。

Method: 开发了一种交替进行标签收集和分布估计的算法，通过计算逻辑得分的保守数据驱动阈值来决定何时需要进行测试，同时估计模型参数和特征分布。

Result: 理论证明算法以至少1-δ的概率不超过目标误分类率，且相比知道真实参数和特征分布的神谕基线，仅需O(√T)的额外测试量。

Conclusion: 首次为误差约束的逻辑测试提供了无遗憾保证，在医疗筛查等应用中能有效估计模型参数并保持安全性，无需过多额外测试。

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

TL;DR: 本文分析了在查询提示前插入无意义标记能提升LLM推理性能的现象，提出了激活重分布模块(ARM)来模拟这种效果，通过调整MLP层激活分布来增强模型表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现在查询提示前插入长序列无意义标记能持续提升LLM推理性能，这一现象令人困惑，需要探究其内在机制并开发更原则性的方法。

Method: 提出激活重分布模块(ARM)，这是一种轻量级推理时技术，直接修改激活而不改变输入序列。ARM自适应识别非线性函数后的近零激活并将其外移，以受控方式重现无意义标记的有益效果。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和模型架构上的广泛实验表明，ARM能持续提升LLM在推理任务上的性能，且仅需几行简单代码即可实现。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为无意义标记的意外益处提供了清晰的机制解释，还开发了一种简单有效的技术，利用激活重分布来进一步提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法未能充分考虑提示难度变化或依赖简单过滤机制，导致计算资源浪费，需要从梯度优化角度系统提升训练效率。

Method: 基于理论分析提出CurES方法：1）优化提示采样分布以控制梯度下降收敛率；2）使用贝叶斯后验估计分配rollout数量，确保梯度更新一致性和稳定性。

Result: 在1.5B和7B模型上分别比GRPO提升3.30和4.82分，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: CurES通过系统优化提示选择和rollout分配，有效提升LLM推理任务的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Gated X-TFC方法，通过软学习的域分解解决了PINNs和X-TFC在奇异摄动边界值问题中处理尖锐梯度的困难，无需复杂的界面惩罚项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs和相关方法在处理奇异摄动边界值问题的尖锐梯度时需要域分解，这会引入复杂的界面惩罚。X-TFC虽然避免了多目标优化，但在边界层问题上计算效率低且与分解不兼容。

Method: 使用可微分的逻辑门进行软学习的域分解，动态调整径向基函数核宽度，无需界面惩罚。还引入了算子条件元学习层，学习从PDE参数到最优门配置的概率映射。

Result: 在1D对流-扩散基准测试中，Gated X-TFC比标准X-TFC误差低一个数量级，使用80%更少的配点，训练时间减少66%。可扩展到多子域和高维问题。

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC为PINNs提供了一个简单且计算高效的替代方案，特别适用于具有挑战性的边界层问题。未来工作将关注非线性问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Method: 训练三类LLMs模型使其拥有特定知识但在直接询问时否认，设计了基于预填充攻击的黑盒方法和基于logit lens、稀疏自编码器的白盒方法进行秘密诱导测试。

Result: 大多数技术优于简单基线，预填充攻击在2/3场景中表现最佳，在剩余场景中白盒技术最有效。

Conclusion: 建立了秘密诱导的公共基准，证明了多种技术可以有效发现AI隐藏的知识，为模型审计提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for
presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will
appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

Motivation: 虽然神经坍缩在分类任务中被证明有益于泛化，但回归任务中类似坍缩现象的影响尚不明确。本文旨在探究回归任务中表示几何与泛化性能的关系。

Method: 通过内在维度分析，比较最后一层特征的内在维度(ID_H)与回归目标的内在维度(ID_Y)。在控制任务和合成数据集上评估不同维度关系对性能的影响。

Result: 坍缩模型表现出ID_H < ID_Y，导致过度压缩和泛化性能下降；非坍缩模型通常保持ID_H > ID_Y。性能与ID_H的关系取决于数据量和噪声水平。

Conclusion: 识别了过度压缩和压缩不足两种机制，为增强神经网络回归泛化性能提供了基于表示几何的实用策略。

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

Motivation: 传统时间序列模型无法处理文本信息，而LLM在处理数值时间序列时效率低下且缺乏时间数据预训练，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用补丁式编码器-解码器架构增强LLM，在200万+时间序列与文本混合样本上训练，涵盖预测、问答、解释、分类和报告生成等任务。

Conclusion: 建立了时间序列分析的新范式，弥合数值计算与自然语言理解之间的鸿沟，通过自然语言交互使复杂的时间推理更加普及。

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COUNTS是首个使用强化学习训练LLM在时间序列任务上进行思维链推理的框架，通过两阶段训练显著提升了LLM在复杂时间序列分析中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列模型无法执行复杂的多步推理过程（如反事实分析、逻辑推理等），而LLM在时间序列任务上表现不佳，需要专门框架来提升其推理能力。

Method: 使用残差向量量化VAE创建高保真离散token，集成到预训练LLM词汇表中；采用两阶段训练：监督微调掌握新表示，然后使用GRPO在可验证问题上训练，鼓励显式推理步骤。

Result: 实验表明，这种基于强化学习的中间思维链推理方法显著提升了LLM在各种时间序列分析任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂时间序列数据推理开辟了新可能性，证明了RL驱动的CoT推理在时间序列领域的有效性。

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在高维欧几里得空间中难以捕捉序列数据的复杂关系和层次结构，这限制了序列分类和相似性度量的准确性。

Method: 将生物序列特征表示变换到双曲面空间，通过双曲面特征向量的内积计算序列间的相似性，构建核矩阵进行分析。

Result: 实验评估表明该方法能有效捕捉重要的序列相关性并提高分类准确率。

Conclusion: 将序列特征映射到双曲面空间的方法能够更好地保留序列的固有结构信息，从而改善序列分析和分类性能。

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR)推理方法，通过并行生成草稿、蒸馏到有限工作空间、然后精炼的方式，在保持高准确率的同时降低延迟和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理训练鼓励LLMs生成长链思维，虽然提高了准确率但增加了上下文长度、计算成本和延迟。研究目标是找到更好的帕累托前沿组合，即更高的准确率与更低的上下文长度/延迟。

Method: 提出了PDR方法：1) 并行生成多样化草稿；2) 蒸馏到有限文本工作空间；3) 基于工作空间进行精炼。还研究了并行度为1的特殊情况Sequential Refinement (SR)。

Result: PDR方法在数学任务上表现优于长链思维推理，在相同顺序预算下超越单次推理基线，PDR带来最大增益（AIME 2024 +11%，AIME 2025 +9%）。

Conclusion: 模型编排的成功提出了进一步训练是否可以改变帕累托前沿的问题。通过强化学习训练的8B思维模型与PDR推理方法一致，在可验证答案的数学任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架和定义碎片化，缺乏对多轮强化学习中哪些设计选择真正有效的系统分析，需要统一的训练配方来指导LLM代理的训练。

Method: 将设计空间分解为环境、奖励和策略三个支柱，在TextWorld、ALFWorld和SWE-Gym等文本领域进行实证研究，分析任务复杂度、奖励稀疏度、策略梯度方法等关键因素。

Result: 发现简单环境可预测复杂任务的泛化能力；密集奖励加速训练但稳定性依赖RL算法选择；奖励稀疏度与策略梯度方法存在交互作用；找到了最优的SFT与RL训练比例。

Conclusion: 提出了一个跨三个支柱协同设计的训练配方，为多轮代理强化学习的研究和实践提供了系统指导。

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL)，一种轻量级强化学习算法，通过学习的价值模型选择中等难度提示来后训练语言模型，显著提高训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练LLM通过RL仍然对批处理和提示选择策略敏感，需要找到平衡生成效率和梯度质量的最佳训练方法。

Method: PCL使用并发更新的价值模型以在线方式识别当前策略的中等难度提示，通过关注产生高有效比的信息提示来优化训练。

Result: PCL在MATH和DeepScaleR上分别实现12.1倍和16.9倍的速度提升，达到最高性能或显著减少达到同等性能所需时间。

Conclusion: PCL为推理导向的RL提供了在性能上限和效率之间改进权衡的新方法。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

TL;DR: TabINR是一个基于隐式神经表示(INR)的表格数据填补框架，通过建模表格为神经函数来处理缺失值问题，在多个真实数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界表格数据经常存在缺失值，传统填补方法容易引入偏差或扭曲数据分布，需要能够提供高质量填补、适应不同数据集大小且推理快速的填补方法。

Method: 引入TabINR框架，使用自动解码器架构的隐式神经表示，通过可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理表格数据的离散结构，能够从部分观测中推断嵌入，实现实例自适应填补。

Result: 在12个不同真实数据集和多种缺失机制下评估，TabINR表现出稳定的强填补准确性，大多匹配或优于传统方法(KNN、MICE、MissForest)和深度学习方法(GAIN、ReMasker)，在高维数据集上优势最明显。

Conclusion: TabINR框架为表格数据填补提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别适合高维数据集，能够在不修改训练模型的情况下实现实例自适应填补。

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD在提供强隐私保证的同时，添加的噪声会破坏梯度矩阵的低秩结构，增加熵值并降低优化效率

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论对梯度进行去噪后处理，恢复低秩结构并提高与原始信号的对齐度

Result: 在RoBERTa模型GLUE任务上的DP-SGD微调中，相比现有方法提高了样本效率，显著减少了达到满意性能所需的训练时间

Conclusion: 矩阵恢复技术可以在不损害隐私保证的前提下，提升私有语言模型训练的实用性

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Method: 使用GAN启发的对抗性损失来拟合源点和目标点之间的神经参数化插值曲线，使得中间时间点的边际分布接近观测分布，然后通过流匹配算法对这些插值进行边际化。

Result: 在空间转录组学和细胞追踪数据集上优于现有基线方法，在单细胞轨迹预测任务上与基线方法表现相当。

Conclusion: ALI-CFM方法具有多功能性和可扩展性，能够生成平滑的插值轨迹，并在多种生物数据集上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

TL;DR: M2PO是一种异步强化学习方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新，在高度陈旧数据下实现稳定的离策略训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖同步训练，需要每次更新时生成新的轨迹数据，效率低下且难以扩展。异步RL系统虽然解耦了轨迹生成和训练，但在处理高度陈旧数据时性能会下降或崩溃。

Method: 提出M2PO（二阶矩信任策略优化），通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新。该方法在高陈旧度下显著减少被裁剪的token比例，精确屏蔽高方差token同时保持优化稳定性。

Result: 在6个模型（1.7B到32B）和8个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，M2PO即使在数据陈旧度达到至少256个模型更新的情况下也能实现稳定的离策略训练，并达到同步策略的性能水平。

Conclusion: M2PO证明了陈旧数据如果被适当利用，可以与同步策略数据一样具有信息性，为大规模语言模型推理的高效强化学习训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然归一化技术在深度学习中广泛应用，但其理论理解相对有限。本研究旨在揭示权重归一化在过参数化矩阵感知问题中的优势。

Method: 使用广义权重归一化结合黎曼优化方法处理过参数化矩阵感知问题，并进行理论分析。

Result: 证明了WN方法实现线性收敛，迭代复杂度和样本复杂度随过参数化程度增加而多项式改善，提供了指数级加速。

Conclusion: 这是首个刻画WN如何利用过参数化实现矩阵感知问题更快收敛的工作，为理解归一化技术的理论优势提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

*Gaoxiang Luo,Aryan Deshwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出COM-BOM算法，通过组合贝叶斯优化解决示例选择的多目标优化问题，同时优化预测准确性和校准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有示例搜索方法仅优化预测准确性，忽视了模型校准这一影响可信度和安全部署的关键因素。

Method: 将示例选择建模为多目标优化问题，使用样本高效的组合贝叶斯优化算法(COM-BOM)寻找准确性和校准误差之间的帕累托前沿。

Result: 在MMLU-Pro基准测试的多个任务中，COM-BOM在联合优化两个目标方面优于或匹配基线方法，且需要最少的LLM API调用。

Conclusion: COM-BOM能够有效平衡预测准确性和模型校准，为可信的上下文学习提供了更好的示例选择方法。

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源社区在工具代理系统开发中面临高质量训练数据缺乏的问题，现有数据集在多样性、真实性和复杂性方面存在局限，特别是多工具和多轮交互场景。

Method: 利用真实MCP环境生成多样化任务，使用5个模型生成工具使用查询，经过质量过滤后，用3个教师模型和2个代理框架生成代理轨迹，并通过规则和模型验证确保质量。

Result: 在Toucan上微调的模型在BFCL V3基准测试中优于更大的闭源模型，并在MCP-Universe Bench上推进了帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Toucan数据集通过提供高质量、多样化的工具代理训练数据，有效推动了开源工具代理系统的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出BroRL方法，通过增加每个训练样本的rollout数量来扩展强化学习，解决了ProRL方法在数千步训练后性能饱和的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ProRL方法通过增加训练步数来扩展强化学习，但性能在数千步后达到平台期，计算资源投入的回报递减。本文探索通过增加每个样本的rollout数量来持续提升性能。

Method: 提出BroRL方法，将每个样本的rollout数量增加到数百个，进行更广泛的探索。基于质量平衡方程分析，证明在单步RL假设下，采样rollout token总是促进正确质量扩展，而未采样token的影响随rollout数量增加而减弱。

Result: BroRL能够复活在3K步ProRL训练后饱和的模型，并实现稳健的持续改进。1.5B模型在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 增加rollout数量是扩展强化学习的有效补充范式，能够突破训练步数扩展的性能饱和限制，实现持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

### [306] [Temporal Score Rescaling for Temperature Sampling in Diffusion and Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01184)
*Yanbo Xu,Yu Wu,Sungjae Park,Zhizhuo Zhou,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种控制去噪扩散和流匹配模型采样多样性的机制，允许用户从比训练分布更尖锐或更宽的分布中进行采样，无需微调即可应用于现成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏对采样多样性的控制能力，用户无法灵活调整生成样本的分布特性。

Method: 通过重新缩放噪声数据分布的得分函数来控制'局部'采样温度，该方法与确定性和随机性采样器都兼容。

Result: 在图像生成、姿态估计、深度预测、机器人操作和蛋白质设计等五个任务中验证，能够从更尖锐或更平坦的分布中采样，提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的采样多样性控制机制，无需额外训练即可改善模型在不同任务中的表现。

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

### [307] [Dirichlet-Prior Shaping: Guiding Expert Specialization in Upcycled MoEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01185)
*Leyla Mirvakhabova,Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi,Gaurav Kumar,Hanxue Liang,Wanru Zhao,Paul Whatmough*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL)方法，通过将专家分配匹配到目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，解决预训练密集模型上采样为稀疏MoE时专家专业化不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练密集模型上采样为稀疏MoE的方法由于简单的权重复制而导致专家专业化不足，即使使用传统正则化，路由仍然表现出低置信度和弱区分度，阻碍性能提升。

Method: 引入DPSL路由器正则化技术，通过匹配专家分配到目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，提供对专家平衡和专业化的细粒度控制，并能编码归纳偏置。

Result: 在基于Qwen2、Phi3、Llama3.2 LLM骨干的上采样MoE视觉语言模型实验中，DPSL在标准视觉语言基准上持续优于上采样策略和正则化技术。

Conclusion: DPSL解决了专家专业化不足的关键问题，促进了更具适应性和更高性能的模型，且作为通用工具可应用于任何输出分类概率分布的模块。

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.
