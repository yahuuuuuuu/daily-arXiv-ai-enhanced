### [1] [FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691)
*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种从自由稀疏图像进行快速表面重建的新方法，通过端到端密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强场景优化，解决了传统方法需要密集校准视图的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法大多需要密集校准视图，而从自由稀疏图像重建往往由于有限重叠和过拟合导致表面质量差。

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集几何一致的高斯场景初始化，采用贡献度剪枝消除局部漂浮物，利用深度和多视图特征监督结合可微分相机参数缓解过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从自由稀疏图像实现高质量表面重建，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

### [3] [ROGR: Relightable 3D Objects using Generative Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03163)
*Jiapeng Tang,Matthew Lavine,Dor Verbin,Stephan J. Garbin,Matthias Nießner,Ricardo Martin Brualla,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Philipp Henzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROGR是一种新的可重光照3D重建方法，通过生成式重光照模型从多视角图像重建物体的可重光照3D模型，能够在任意环境光照下高效重光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法需要针对每种光照进行优化或进行光线传输模拟，效率较低。需要开发一种能够高效处理任意环境光照的重光照方法。

Method: 使用生成式重光照模型采样物体在多种光照环境下的外观，训练光照条件神经辐射场（NeRF）。采用新颖的双分支架构分别编码一般光照效果和镜面反射。

Result: 在TensoIR和Stanford-ORB数据集上评估，在大多数指标上优于现有最先进方法，并在真实世界物体捕获上展示了良好效果。

Conclusion: ROGR方法能够高效实现任意环境光照下的前向重光照，无需针对每种光照进行优化或光线传输模拟，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

### [4] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Oracle-RLAIF框架，用通用Oracle排序器替代训练奖励模型，结合基于排名的GRPO_rank损失函数，在视频理解任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模扩大，收集人类反馈成本高昂。现有RLAIF框架依赖专门的奖励模型，训练成本高且限制性强。

Method: 使用Oracle排序器对候选模型响应进行排序而非打分，提出基于GRPO的GRPO_rank排名损失函数，直接优化序数反馈。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，Oracle-RLAIF始终优于使用现有微调方法的领先VLM。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF为使用排名而非分数的强化学习对齐大型多模态视频模型提供了灵活且数据高效的框架路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了物理基础和视觉对齐的运动重建，为单目视频中的人类运动重建提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

### [6] [Unlocking the power of partnership: How humans and machines can work together to improve face recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02570)

Motivation: 研究人机协作面部识别系统的准确率提升条件，探索如何有效结合人类和机器的优势来提高识别准确性。

Method: 使用专家和非专家面部识别者的数据，分析人-人和人-机协作效果，建立近端准确率规则(PAR)，确定关键融合区域，并实施智能人机融合策略。

Result: 发现协作效益随协作者间基线准确率差异减小而增加，关键融合区域范围意外地大。智能融合比单独机器更准确，也比简单组合所有判断更有效。

Conclusion: 人机协作在面部识别中具有重要价值，智能融合策略能显著提升系统准确率，同时最小化低表现人类对系统的影响，为AI在面部识别中的智能应用提供了实证路线图。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [7] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于视频生成模型不确定性量化的框架S-QUBED，通过潜在空间建模将预测不确定性分解为偶然性和认知性成分，并提供了评估指标和基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型存在幻觉问题，会产生看似合理但事实错误的视频，但目前缺乏像大语言模型那样的不确定性量化方法，这带来了严重的安全隐患。

Method: 提出了一个不确定性量化框架，包括：基于稳健秩相关估计的校准评估指标；黑盒UQ方法S-QUBED，利用潜在建模将不确定性分解为偶然性和认知性成分；以及用于基准测试的UQ数据集。

Result: 在基准视频数据集上的实验表明，S-QUBED能够计算与任务准确度负相关的校准总不确定性估计，并有效分解偶然性和认知性不确定性成分。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对视频生成模型的不确定性量化工作，提出的S-QUBED框架能够可靠地量化视频模型的不确定性，为提升视频生成的安全性提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [8] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)的新方法，通过优化文本嵌入来提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成图像的美学质量，无需额外训练且与骨干模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练文本到图像扩散模型在简单提示词下生成图像美学质量不足的问题，无需重新训练模型或精心设计提示词。

Method: 使用三重目标函数优化文本嵌入：提升生成图像的美学保真度、确保与优化后文本嵌入的一致性、通过提示词保持项最小化与初始提示词的差异。

Result: 定量和定性评估证实了该方法的有效性，在性能上超过或等同于最先进的文本到图像和提示词适应方法。

Conclusion: PEO方法能够有效提升简单提示词下生成图像的美学质量，具有训练无关和骨干模型无关的优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型无标记多摄像头系统，用于在野外条件下精确捕捉3D手部和物体交互，解决了现有数据集在环境多样性和模型泛化方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手部跟踪数据集主要在受控实验室环境中采集，缺乏环境多样性，限制了模型的泛化能力。需要开发能够在真实野外条件下精确捕捉3D手部交互的系统。

Method: 设计轻量级背戴式捕捉装置，包含8个外中心摄像头和Meta Quest 3头显提供的2个自我中心视角。开发了自我-外中心跟踪流程来生成准确的3D手部姿态真值。

Result: 收集了包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿态的标注数据集，显著减少了环境真实性与3D标注准确性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在几乎不受约束的移动条件下，在真实野外环境中实现精确的3D手部和物体跟踪，为无约束环境下的手部交互研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [10] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于输入人体姿态条件的视频蒸馏方法，将多步扩散模型蒸馏为少步学生模型，实现实时语音驱动视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法由于需要大量去噪步骤和昂贵的注意力机制，导致速度慢，无法实现实时部署。

Method: 利用输入人体姿态条件指导注意力和损失函数：1）使用人体姿态关键点对应关系引导注意力到相关区域；2）引入输入感知蒸馏损失改善唇部同步和手部运动真实感。

Result: 实现了实时性能，相比现有音频驱动和输入驱动方法具有更好的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过输入感知稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失的结合，在保持高质量的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [11] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FunLoRA的新方法，通过使用仅包含秩1矩阵的低秩适应机制来缓解生成模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需依赖合成数据重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型在持续适应过程中面临灾难性遗忘的挑战，现有方法依赖合成数据重训练会导致训练时间增加和性能下降。

Method: 设计了基于低秩适应的功能LoRA方法，使用秩1矩阵并通过精心选择的函数增加重参数化矩阵的秩，仅需在当前任务数据上训练。

Result: 实验表明该方法在基于流匹配的模型上超越了基于扩散模型的现有最佳结果，达到更高的分类准确率，同时仅需少量内存成本和采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA通过动态条件机制有效避免了灾难性遗忘，为生成模型的持续学习提供了参数高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [12] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种双视场、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通灯和标志识别，通过统一防御堆栈降低攻击成功率和高风险误分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆中交通灯和标志识别错误直接影响导航和安全，现有方法缺乏对时间连续性、多静态视场感知以及对数字和自然退化的鲁棒性考虑。

Method: 基于多源数据集构建双视场框架，采用三层防御堆栈：特征压缩、防御蒸馏和基于熵的异常检测，结合序列时间投票增强。

Result: 统一防御堆栈达到79.8mAP，将攻击成功率降至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，高风险误分类降至32%。

Conclusion: 该框架在多种操作设计域中表现出优越的鲁棒性，有效提升了自动驾驶交通感知系统的安全性。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

### [13] [Smart-GRPO: Smartly Sampling Noise for Efficient RL of Flow-Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02654)
*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO是首个针对流匹配模型中强化学习的噪声扰动优化方法，通过迭代搜索策略改进噪声分布，提升奖励优化和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型的确定性特性使其不适合强化学习，而现有方法通过随机噪声扰动效率低且不稳定。

Method: 采用迭代搜索策略：解码候选扰动、用奖励函数评估、向高奖励区域优化噪声分布。

Result: 实验表明Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

### [14] [MoGIC: Boosting Motion Generation via Intention Understanding and Visual Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02722)
*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC是一个统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过整合意图建模和视觉先验来提升运动合成的精度和个性化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动运动生成方法存在局限性：无法捕捉动作执行的因果逻辑和人类意图，缺乏视觉基础限制了生成精度和个性化。

Method: 提出MoGIC框架，联合优化多模态条件运动生成和意图预测，引入混合注意力机制实现条件token与运动子序列的局部对齐，构建440小时Mo440H基准数据集。

Result: 微调后，MoGIC在HumanML3D和Mo440H上分别降低FID 38.6%和34.6%，在运动描述任务中超越基于LLM的方法，并支持意图预测和视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC推进了可控运动合成和意图理解，展示了多模态生成能力，为运动合成领域提供了新范式。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于运动自适应的动态3D重建框架，通过语义和运动先验优化控制点分配，在动态区域集中控制点，抑制静态背景冗余，并使用样条轨迹参数化实现更平滑的运动表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏控制方法仅基于几何分配控制点，导致静态区域冗余和动态区域不足，无法有效处理运动复杂度的空间变化。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型的语义和运动先验建立patch-token-node对应关系，通过运动自适应压缩和迭代体素化实现控制密度与运动复杂度对齐，采用基于样条的轨迹参数化替代MLP变形场。

Result: 在重建质量和效率上相比现有最先进方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的运动自适应框架通过优化控制点分配和运动表示，有效解决了动态3D重建中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Net2Net结合无监督DIP和预训练DRUNet网络，通过去噪正则化实现真实世界噪声去除，无需大量标注数据且能适应不同噪声模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，难以处理真实噪声复杂性；深度学习需要大量标注数据且泛化能力有限。

Method: 结合无监督DIP网络和预训练DRUNet网络，通过去噪正则化(RED)融合两者优势，无监督网络适应单张图像噪声特性，预训练网络提供鲁棒去噪能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明该方法在真实世界噪声去除方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: Net2Net混合框架能有效提升不同噪声模式下的泛化能力，在训练数据有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过逐步推理提升检索准确性。解决了DeepSeek-R1直接应用于检索任务时的高计算成本和训练不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-R1展示了RL增强LLM推理能力的潜力，但直接应用于检索任务存在高计算成本（多候选推理消耗大量token）和训练不稳定性问题。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块和细节检查机制减少token数量但保留关键信息；提出新训练范式，包括使用检索定制合成CoT数据集的激活阶段，以及采用课程奖励的RL训练。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过信息压缩和新的训练范式，Retrv-R1成功将R1风格推理应用于多模态检索，在保持高性能的同时解决了计算效率和训练稳定性问题。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

TL;DR: BCA+是一个无需训练、无需反向传播的测试时自适应框架，通过动态缓存机制和贝叶斯推理，统一处理目标识别和检测任务中的分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法要么依赖计算昂贵的反向传播，要么只关注似然度调整而忽略先验分布的重要性，限制了实时部署效果。

Method: 引入动态缓存机制，自适应存储和更新类别嵌入、空间尺度（检测任务）以及基于历史预测的自适应类别先验，通过贝叶斯推理融合初始VLM输出与基于缓存的预测。

Result: 在识别和检测基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: BCA+通过双自适应机制和不确定性引导的融合，能够同时修正模型的语义理解和上下文置信度，为实时部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于脑肿瘤分类的层次化广义类别发现方法（HGCD-BT），通过结合层次聚类和对比学习，能够识别训练时未见过的肿瘤类别，在OpenSRH数据集上相比现有GCD方法准确率提升28%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤分类方法局限于预定义类别，无法识别训练时未见的肿瘤类型。广义类别发现（GCD）虽然能识别已知和未知类别，但缺乏对脑肿瘤分类学层次结构的考虑。

Method: 将层次聚类与对比学习相结合，在基于对比学习的GCD基础上引入半监督层次聚类损失函数，构建层次化广义类别发现框架。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，patch级分类准确率相比最先进GCD方法提升28%，在识别未见肿瘤类别方面表现优异。在Digital Brain Tumor Atlas的slide级分类中也验证了方法的跨模态通用性。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT方法能够有效识别已知和未知脑肿瘤类别，考虑了肿瘤分类的层次结构，在多种成像模态下都具有良好性能，为术中决策提供了更准确的分类工具。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key是一个无需训练的关键帧采样模块，通过统一的相关性-多样性最大体积目标，为长视频理解提供信息丰富且非冗余的帧选择，在弱对齐情况下自动切换到多样性模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中存在关键时刻遗漏、冗余帧选择或忽略查询相关性等问题，需要一种能够平衡相关性和多样性的高效采样方法。

Method: 提出RD-MV目标函数，结合查询条件相关性评分和对数行列式多样性组件，并采用轻量级相关性感知门控机制处理弱对齐情况。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和Video-MME上的广泛实验显示，特别是在长视频上达到了最先进的性能，且计算高效，可在单个GPU上实时运行。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key是一个无需训练、即插即用的高效关键帧采样模块，显著提升了长视频理解性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在复杂横向思维挑战（如字谜）上的认知过程仍然不透明。现有研究表明这些模型在字谜解决方面表现不佳，但底层的推理过程和失败模式尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究构建了包含221个字谜的系统标注数据集，涵盖六个认知类别，并开发了一个将推理质量与答案正确性分离的评估框架。调查了三种提示策略以引出不同类型的解释过程。

Result: 研究发现推理质量在不同谜题类别间差异显著，模型在视觉组合方面表现出系统性优势，但在缺失解释和文化象征方面存在根本局限性。提示策略显著影响认知方法和问题解决效果。

Conclusion: 可解释性应被视为模型性能的组成部分而非事后考虑，提示策略对模型认知过程和问题解决能力有重要影响。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Motivation: 现有文本移除研究主要关注自然图像中的场景文本，但当前数据集存在地面真值伪影、背景过于简化以及评估指标无法捕捉生成结果质量等问题，限制了跨域泛化能力。

Method: 通过对象感知放置和视觉语言模型生成内容，在复杂背景上渲染文本，创建具有干净地面真值和挑战性文本移除场景的数据集。

Result: 开发了一个适用于场景文本之外领域的文本移除基准数据集，该数据集可在Hugging Face上获取。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集解决了现有基准的局限性，为文本移除任务提供了更准确和具有挑战性的评估环境。

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 解决单一检测器在混合医学模态（如CXR、CT、MRI）上训练时，由于统计异质性和表示空间不连续导致的性能下降问题。

Conclusion: 为稳健的多模态医学目标检测提供了一条实用路径，能够有效改善跨模态检测性能。

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在视觉语言理解方面表现出色，但存在生成与输入视觉和文本内容相矛盾的幻觉问题。现有方法如对比解码和注意力操作存在构建对比样本困难或稳定性不足的问题。

Method: 提出图像头掩码对比解码(MaskCD)，利用LVLMs中的"图像头"，通过掩码这些头来构建对比样本进行对比解码。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7b和Qwen-VL-7b上的评估显示，MaskCD在CHAIR、POPE、AMBER和MME等基准测试中有效缓解幻觉现象，同时保持LVLMs的通用能力。

Conclusion: MaskCD方法能够有效解决大视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题，且不影响模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应权重学习和渐进增强策略，有效解决了多模态医学图像合成中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了更灵活和准确的模态重建能力。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/Kenshin-Keeps/Egg_Quality_Prediction_ELMF4EggQ, promoting
transparency, reproducibility, and further research in this domain.

Conclusion: 补丁级语义表示对可扩展的描述生成非常有效

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

*Bing Li,Jiaxin Chen,Dongming Zhang,Xiuguo Bao,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MEACI-Net框架，通过运动增强和多模态交互提升压缩视频动作识别的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩视频动作识别存在动态信息粗糙噪声大、RGB与运动模态融合不足的问题

Method: 采用双流架构，运动流使用多尺度块和去噪模块增强表示，通过SMC和CMA模块加强模态间交互

Result: 在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-400基准测试中表现出有效性和高效性

Conclusion: MEACI-Net能有效解决压缩视频动作识别中的动态噪声和模态融合问题

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需训练的简单方法，利用InternImage骨干网络特征，通过K-Means聚类和置信度阈值来检测语义分割中的未知物体，在多个基准测试中超越了有监督和无监督基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中检测未知物体至关重要。虽然大型视觉基础模型在闭集语义任务中表现出色，但它们在语义分割中检测分布外区域的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出简单的无需训练方法：使用InternImage骨干网络特征，应用K-Means聚类并结合原始解码器logits的置信度阈值来识别分布外聚类。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准测试上达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准测试上达到48.77平均精度，使用InternImage-L模型超越了多个有监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明这是一种有前景的方向，为通用分布外分割方法提供了需要最少假设或额外数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV是一个简单有效的视觉token剪枝框架，通过从整体视角重新思考token保留策略，在不同空间裁剪中自适应分配剪枝预算，解决了传统基于注意力的剪枝方法在高剪枝比率下性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大，现有基于注意力机制的token剪枝方法倾向于保留语义相似的token，在高剪枝比率下会造成明显的性能下降。

Method: 提出HoloV框架，从整体视角重新设计token保留策略，通过在不同空间裁剪中自适应分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token能够捕捉全局视觉上下文而非孤立的显著特征。

Result: HoloV在各种任务、MLLM架构和剪枝比率下均优于现有方法，例如LLaVA1.5在使用HoloV剪枝88.9%视觉token后仍能保持95.8%的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV通过整体视角的token剪枝策略，有效缓解了表示崩溃问题，在保持任务相关信息的同时实现了优越的效率-精度权衡。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CAW方法增强视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，通过置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化提升干净和对抗样本的准确率，在多个数据集上优于现有方法且内存消耗更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现优异，但对对抗攻击非常脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个组件：(1) 置信度感知损失，通过缩放干净和对抗预测之间的KL散度来优先处理不确定的对抗样本；(2) 特征对齐正则化，通过最小化冻结和微调图像编码器在对抗输入上的特征距离来保持语义一致性。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAW在强攻击如AutoAttack下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，同时使用更少内存。

Conclusion: CAW能有效提升视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下同时改善干净和鲁棒准确率。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉粥样硬化疾病的风险评估需要整合多样化的临床和影像信息，但现有方法缺乏透明性和可解释性。研究旨在探索大型视觉语言模型在多模态颈动脉斑块评估中的潜力。

Method: 提出一个模拟真实诊断场景的框架，比较多种开源LVLMs模型。使用零样本实验评估模型性能，并通过低秩适应（LoRA）对LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna进行超声领域适配，整合多模态表格数据。

Result: 零样本实验显示LVLMs在识别成像模式和解剖结构方面表现不一，但在风险分类方面普遍较差。经过领域适应后，模型在卒中风险分层方面有显著改进，多模态数据整合进一步提高了特异性和平衡准确率。

Conclusion: LVLMs在基于超声的心血管风险预测中具有潜力但存在局限性，强调了多模态整合、模型校准和领域适应对于临床转化的重要性。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

Motivation: 现有方法使用深度自编码器生成器参数效率低，缺乏可解释的训练策略，需要改进多期相增强MRI合成中的特征分离

Method: 使用轻量级特征解耦VAE模型，将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，采用Y形双向训练策略

Result: 相比现有深度自编码器端到端合成方法，FDA-VAE显著减少模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提高合成质量

Conclusion: FDA-VAE为多期相增强MRI合成提供了一种参数高效且可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了LPG-Bench基准测试和TIT评估方法，用于评估长提示文本到图像生成的质量，解决了现有模型对长提示理解不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在短提示上表现良好，但在理解和遵循长而详细的提示时存在困难，生成结果不一致。

Method: 构建了包含200个平均长度超过250词提示的LPG-Bench基准，并提出了基于文本-图像-文本一致性的TIT评估方法，包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两个实例化版本。

Result: 实验表明TIT方法在长提示图像生成评估中与人类判断的一致性优于现有方法，TIT-Score-LLM在成对准确率上比最强基线提高了7.31%。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法为评估和促进文本到图像模型的发展提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法存在速度慢、几何失真、依赖手动3D掩码等问题，需要开发更实用和可扩展的3D编辑解决方案。

Method: 构建了3DEditVerse数据集（116,309个训练对和1,500个测试对），并提出3DEditFormer模型，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控机制来分离可编辑区域和保留结构。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架在定量和定性评估上都优于现有最先进方法，为实用和可扩展的3D编辑设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 提出的3DEditVerse数据集和3DEditFormer模型成功解决了3D编辑的关键挑战，实现了无需手动3D掩码的精确一致编辑。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云图像，在云层常见的热带地区实用性受限；同时深度网络编码器下采样过程中会丢失空间和光谱细节。

Method: 开发云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖；提出轻量级方法将归一化差异指数(NDIs)注入最终解码层；结合Sentinel-1雷达数据与光学数据进行融合。

Result: 在DFC2020数据集上，NDI注入使U-Net性能提升1.99%，DeepLabV3提升2.78%；在云覆盖条件下，结合Sentinel-1数据相比仅使用光学数据在所有模型上都获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: NDI注入能有效保留关键空间特征，Sentinel-1雷达数据在云覆盖条件下能有效补充光学数据，雷达-光学融合在挑战性大气场景中效果显著。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous

the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型潜在空间的图像扰动方法，通过改变去噪轨迹的起点来生成不可学习的训练样本，保护数据隐私和防止未经授权的模型个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在个性化过程中可能引发的数据隐私、知识产权保护和未经授权使用的问题，现有像素空间扰动方法存在噪声和伪影问题。

Method: 在扩散模型的潜在空间中操作，交替进行去噪和反转过程，修改去噪轨迹的起点，实现轨迹偏移采样。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的验证显示，该方法在感知指标（PSNR、SSIM、FID）上提升了约8%-10%，在五种对抗设置下平均提升了约10%的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法将不可学习性集成到潜在扩散模型框架中，提供了一种实用且不易察觉的防御机制，有效保护敏感数据免受未经授权的模型适应。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在辐射场语义蒸馏中几何基础特征与纯视觉特征的对比效果，发现几何基础特征包含更多几何细节但反而降低了姿态估计精度，而纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中表现更好。


<details>

Motivation: 探索几何基础语义特征在蒸馏辐射场中的潜在优势，特别是在空间任务如姿态估计中的表现，以解决现有工作缺乏语义集成的问题。

Method: 提出了SPINE框架，包含基于蒸馏语义的粗略反演和基于光度优化的精细反演两个核心组件，用于无初始猜测的辐射场反演。

Result: 几何基础特征包含更精细的结构细节，但在语义目标定位任务中无显著差异，且姿态估计精度反而下降；纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中具有更好的通用性，未来需要研究有效的几何基础策略来增强预训练语义特征的多功能性和性能。

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete是一个新颖的参考驱动图像补全框架，通过整合显式3D结构指导来增强几何一致性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成方法仅依赖扩散先验，缺乏几何线索（如相机姿态或深度），在目标视图与参考图像差异较大时经常产生错位或不合理的内容。

Method: 采用双分支扩散架构：一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云提取几何特征。通过联合自注意力确保一致性，并使用目标感知掩码来聚焦相关参考线索。

Result: 实验显示GeoComplete在PSNR指标上比最先进方法提升17.1，显著提高了几何准确性同时保持高视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过整合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，GeoComplete为几何条件图像补全提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到声音视频生成中的两个关键挑战：(1)共享文本标注导致的模态干扰问题；(2)跨模态特征交互机制不明确的问题。

Method: 提出分层视觉基础标注框架生成解耦的视频和音频标注，并设计BridgeDiT双塔扩散变换器，采用双向交叉注意力机制实现语义和时间同步。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在大多数指标上达到了最先进的结果，并通过消融研究验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到声音视频生成任务提供了有效的解决方案，代码和检查点将公开发布。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分离视觉皮层的两个层次区域提取不同特征，结合结构生成器和语义提取器，使用Versatile Diffusion模型合成图像，在复杂场景中提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恢复复杂视觉刺激时面临挑战，自然场景的低级特征异质性和高级特征语义纠缠导致重建困难。

Method: 将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：结构生成器从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验，语义提取器将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入，通过Versatile Diffusion模型集成合成最终图像。

Result: 实验结果表明HAVIR在复杂场景中提升了重建的结构和语义质量，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 基于视觉皮层层次表示理论的HAVIR模型有效解决了复杂视觉刺激重建的挑战，在结构和语义质量上均有显著提升。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

TL;DR: Mask2IV是一个用于生成交互中心视频的两阶段框架，无需密集掩码标注，通过预测动作轨迹来生成高质量的人机交互视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法难以建模复杂的动态交互，且获取密集精确的掩码标注在现实应用中存在挑战。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段流程：首先预测执行者和物体的合理运动轨迹，然后基于这些轨迹生成视频。

Result: 在涵盖人机交互和机器人操作场景的两个基准测试中，该方法在视觉真实性和可控性方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架成功实现了无需密集掩码输入的交互中心视频生成，支持灵活直观的控制方式。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

Motivation: 脊柱疾病影响全球6.19亿人，是导致残疾的主要原因，但AI辅助诊断因缺乏椎体级别感知的多模态数据集而受限。临床决策需要跨X光、CT和MRI在特定椎体级别进行复杂推理。

Method: 与执业脊柱外科医生共同设计，采用两阶段LLM生成方法（草稿和修订）创建SpineMed-450k数据集，包含45万条指令实例，涵盖教科书、指南、开放数据集和约1000个医院病例。

Conclusion: 临床医生评估证实了模型输出的诊断清晰度和实用性，SpineMed为脊柱疾病AI诊断提供了高质量的数据集和评估标准。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

Conclusion: UniShield通过多智能体统一框架有效解决了伪造图像检测与定位中的跨领域泛化和自适应问题，为维护信息完整性和社会安全提供了强有力的技术支撑。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

Motivation: 为了在有限计算预算下实现真实的世界建模和交互场景生成，模型需要在探索新场景时生成自然内容，同时在重访已探索区域时保持空间一致性。现有方法在时间记忆和空间记忆之间存在权衡。

Method: 结合混合训练（区分探索和重访模式）和链式前向训练（通过模型展开增加姿态变化），使用点对帧检索和增量3D重建来维护几何索引空间记忆。

Result: 在多样化环境中实现了优越的长期空间一致性和生成质量，同时在扩展序列中保持计算效率。

Conclusion: Memory Forcing框架有效平衡了空间一致性和生成质量，为自回归视频扩散模型的世界建模提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Method: 利用单模态和跨模态表示构建统一潜在空间，捕捉模态间复杂依赖关系，实现灵活跨模态检索。

Result: MonSTeR优于仅依赖单模态表示的三模态模型，检索分数与人类偏好一致，并在零样本场景物体放置和运动描述任务中展现良好性能。

Conclusion: MonSTeR是首个运动-场景-文本检索模型，成功构建了统一潜在空间，为跨模态对齐评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机共振的测试时防御机制，通过引入微小平移扰动来对抗对抗性攻击，无需训练、架构无关且攻击类型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖特征过滤或平滑，会导致信息损失。本文旨在开发一种既能增强鲁棒性又能最小化信息损失的测试时防御机制。

Method: 通过引入微小平移扰动，对齐变换后的特征嵌入，聚合后再映射回原始参考图像，形成闭式公式，可部署于各种网络架构。

Result: 在图像分类任务中恢复高达68.1%的准确率损失，在立体匹配中恢复71.9%，在光流中恢复29.2%，首次为密集预测任务建立了通用测试时防御。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在多种任务和攻击类型下的有效性，突出了其多功能性和实用性，为对抗性防御提供了新的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

Result: 在多个具有不同特征和挑战的纯纹理基准测试中取得了有趣的结果。

Conclusion: Mixer方法在纹理识别任务中表现出色，源代码将在发表后提供。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RULER tokens和I-MRoPE两种创新方法，解决GUI grounding任务中VLM在未见高分辨率显示上的坐标映射问题，显著提升了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM在GUI grounding任务中面临核心瓶颈：可靠的patch-to-pixel映射在训练未见的高分辨率显示上会失效，导致坐标生成不准确。

Method: 1. RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记，让模型像地图网格线一样参考位置；2. I-MRoPE改进空间编码，确保宽度和高度维度对称表示。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示定位精度持续提升，在高分辨率界面上改进最大。

Conclusion: 通过提供显式空间指导而非依赖隐式学习，该方法能在不同分辨率和平台上实现更可靠的GUI自动化。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在通用视觉基准上表现良好，但在医疗影像等专业领域的OOD任务中表现不佳，这些领域标注数据有限且昂贵。

Method: 使用QA生成器通过caption蒸馏生成领域相关伪问答对，选择性更新问答相关神经元，使QA生成器在蒸馏过程中高效获取领域特定知识。

Result: 在胃肠道内窥镜和体育VQA实验中，LEAML在最小监督下始终优于标准微调方法。

Conclusion: LEAML框架在标签稀缺场景下有效提升了MLLM在专业领域的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowserArena是一个实时开放网络代理评估平台，通过用户提交任务、头对头比较和步骤级人工反馈来识别网络代理的失败模式，发现了验证码解决、弹出横幅移除和直接URL导航三个主要失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实开放网络环境下的评估平台来识别代理的实际失败模式。

Method: 开发BrowserArena平台，收集用户任务，进行Arena式头对头比较，使用步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并构建针对性数据集研究特定失败模式。

Result: 识别出三个一致的失败模式：验证码解决、弹出横幅移除和直接URL导航。不同语言模型在这些失败模式上表现各异，如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，DeepSeek-R1在验证码解决上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网络代理具有多样性和脆弱性，该基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网络代理失败模式提供了途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Motivation: 现有电影摄影理解基准ShotBench存在选项设计模糊问题，且ShotVL模型在推理一致性和指令遵循方面存在不足，这影响了评估的可靠性，阻碍了公平比较和未来进展。

Method: 通过一致的选项重构系统性地改进ShotBench，对ShotVL的推理行为进行首次批判性分析，并引入扩展评估协议来联合评估任务准确性和核心模型能力。

Result: 开发了RefineShot基准，这是一个经过精炼和扩展的基准测试，能够实现更可靠的评估并促进电影摄影理解的未来发展。

Conclusion: RefineShot基准解决了ShotBench的局限性，为电影摄影理解任务提供了更可靠的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布无关风险控制的方法，通过动态提前退出机制来防御恶意上下文示例对LLM的影响，在保持零样本性能的同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在上下文学习中可能受到错误或恶意示例影响的安全问题，确保模型性能不会因有害演示而显著下降。

Method: 定义零样本安全基准，应用分布无关风险控制，采用动态提前退出预测机制，忽略对不安全输入关注度高的注意力头。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文演示的风险，同时在有益演示上获得显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为LLM提供了内置的安全防护机制，能够在保持安全性的同时优化计算效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型多模态模型中的特定注意力头负责处理空间关系表征，这些注意力头的激活向量可以提取并操控，从而改善模型在关系任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型多模态模型展现出强大的上下文学习能力，但其内部支持任务学习的机制仍不透明，需要深入理解模型如何编码和处理空间关系知识。

Method: 使用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并在保持模型参数冻结的情况下用少量训练数据微调这些向量。

Result: 提取的功能向量能提高零样本推理准确率，微调后显著优于上下文学习基线，且关系特定的功能向量可以线性组合解决涉及新空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以系统性地提取和优化，有助于理解模型模块化并增强对关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials

lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user

agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical

accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Result: 模型在单模态冲突识别中达到90%准确率，但在跨模态冲突中仅3%。跨模态注意力存在极端不对称性，显式组合多模态训练能显著减少注意力不平衡，并提升多个视觉-语言基准测试性能。

Conclusion: 系统性地处理跨模态上下文对于构建可靠的基础模型至关重要，当前模型在多模态联合推理方面存在显著不足，需要专门设计训练策略来改善跨模态注意力平衡。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

TL;DR: 论文发现测试时缩放(TTS)在大量样本下存在收益递减，提出温度维度缩放可显著提升LLM推理能力，使基础模型达到接近RL训练模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法通过生成多个推理轨迹并选择最佳结果来提升LLM推理能力，但研究发现这种方法的改进存在上限，某些难题无法通过增加样本数量解决。

Method: 提出温度维度缩放方法，通过在不同采样温度下生成推理轨迹，扩大模型的推理边界，并设计了多温度投票方法来降低计算开销。

Result: 在Qwen3系列模型和五个代表性推理基准测试中，温度缩放相比单温度TTS额外提升了7.3个百分点，使基础模型达到与RL训练模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 测试时缩放比之前认为的更强大，温度缩放提供了一种简单有效的方法来释放基础模型的潜在能力，无需额外后训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

### [70] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的可能性概念作为Zadeh 1978年标准的替代方案，专注于现实世界事件的可能性，通过计算先决条件成立和约束不成立的概率函数来评估事件可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代Zadeh的标准可能性概念，专注于现实世界事件的可能性评估，特别是在规划问题中确定最可行的计划。

Method: 将事件视为具有促使其发生的先决条件和阻碍其发生的约束，可能性计算为先决条件成立概率和约束不成立概率的函数。

Result: 开发了一种新的可能性理论，可用于规划问题中评估不同计划的可行性，并通过车辆路线规划示例进行了说明。

Conclusion: 这种可能性模型可能正确捕捉了人类关于计划的正常推理，并具有未来应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

TL;DR: AutoMaAS是一个自进化的多智能体架构搜索框架，通过神经架构搜索原则自动发现最优智能体配置，在提升性能的同时降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化设计方法寻求单一解决方案，无法根据查询复杂度和领域需求自适应分配资源，需要更灵活的多智能体系统设计方法。

Method: 采用神经架构搜索原则，包含四个关键创新：自动算子生成/融合/消除、动态成本感知优化、在线反馈集成、增强可解释性的决策追踪机制。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，相比最先进方法实现了1.0-7.1%的性能提升，同时减少3-5%的推理成本，在不同数据集和LLM骨干网络上表现出优异的可迁移性。

Conclusion: AutoMaAS为大语言模型时代的自动化多智能体系统设计建立了新范式，展示了优越的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs是一个自适应红队代理，通过推理增强的多步骤编排自动优化多样化红队策略，有效激发目标视觉语言模型的有害输出，在基准测试中达到最先进的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，涵盖VLM的多样化对抗模式，通过模型上下文协议集成17种红队算法，设计分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法平衡攻击多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中，ARMs达到最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。构建了ARMs-Bench数据集，包含30K+红队实例，覆盖51个风险类别。

Conclusion: 基于ARMs-Bench的安全微调显著提高了VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可操作指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一种约束中心的架构，通过层次化结构空间和领域特定表示来规范LLMs，实现生产调度中可靠的自动约束规范，显著优于纯LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然APS系统在现代制造中至关重要，但将制造需求转化为正式约束的过程仍依赖人工且劳动密集。尽管LLMs在从异构制造数据自动生成约束方面有潜力，但直接应用面临自然语言歧义、非确定性输出和领域知识有限等挑战。

Method: 设计约束中心架构，定义跨三个层次组织的层次化结构空间，通过领域特定表示确保精度和可靠性；开发自动生产场景适配算法，为特定制造配置高效定制架构。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法成功平衡了LLMs的生成能力和制造系统的可靠性要求，在约束规范任务中显著优于纯LLM方法。

Conclusion: 提出的约束中心架构有效解决了LLMs在制造约束规范中的可靠性问题，为自动化生产调度约束生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证多步推理时存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力稀释，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样。

Method: NCV将验证重构为节点级的轻量级二进制一致性检查，通过将思维链分解为相互连接的验证节点来避免不必要的长文本生成。

Result: 在公共数据集上，NCV相比传统方法（如基于CoT的验证器）在F1分数上提升10%到25%，同时使用的token数量减少6到58倍。

Conclusion: NCV方法提高了可解释性和效率，为可靠的LLM推理验证提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准测试主要依赖答案匹配，无法评估智能体在复杂任务中的问题解决轨迹，如效率、幻觉和适应性等重要方面。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过证据库积累推理步骤中的知识，实现多维度评估。创建包含多样化和有缺陷轨迹的元评估数据集来验证框架。

Result: TRACE能够准确评估复杂行为，具有可扩展性和成本效益，即使使用小型开源LLM也能有效工作。

Conclusion: TRACE为工具增强LLM智能体提供了全面的多维度评估方法，揭示了之前未报告的观察结果和见解。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文质疑机器学习中训练模型能完全满足目标函数的假设（OSA），指出在现实条件下由于近似、估计和优化误差，系统必然会偏离预期目标，且目标规范本身也难以完美表达开发者意图。基于数学分析，这种差距在强优化压力下会导致Goodhart定律失效，因此需要对通用AI系统的优化设定原则性限制以避免失控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战机器学习中普遍但未经检验的假设——训练模型能完全满足目标函数（OSA），揭示其在现实条件下的系统性失效问题，特别是当面对强优化压力时可能导致的Goodhart定律失效和失控风险。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的分析框架，从技术误差（近似、估计、优化误差）和规范误差（目标规范无法完美表达开发者意图）两个维度论证OSA的失效，并基于近期数学结果分析这些差距在强优化下的行为模式。

Result: 证明在现实条件下OSA必然失效，目标函数与实际优化结果存在系统性偏差；这些偏差在强优化压力下会演变为Goodhart定律的失效模式，且无法事先确定失效临界点。

Conclusion: 由于无法事先定位Goodhart失效点，必须对通用AI系统的优化设定原则性限制，否则持续优化将导致可预测且不可逆的失控风险。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

TL;DR: 提出BayesianRouter框架，通过结合离线RM强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择来解决现有奖励模型路由方法的冷启动和探索不足问题，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF/RLAIF流水线依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并存在过拟合风险。现有路由方法存在冷启动和探索不足的问题。

Method: 提出混合路由框架：离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计每个RM的可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样路由器进行逐查询RM选择，将离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布。

Result: 在指令跟随（AlpacaEval-2、Arena-Hard、MT-Bench）和推理（GSM8K、MMLU）基准测试中，BayesianRouter始终优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法。

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过结合离线和在线学习，有效解决了奖励模型路由中的冷启动和探索不足问题，显著提升了对齐质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Motivation: 离散扩散模型的非自回归特性使得重要性采样难以处理，传统强化学习方法如GRPO难以应用，需要新的优化方法

Method: 构建重要性估计器捕捉token波动，为视觉序列定制rollout方法，实现多样性完成和可靠优化梯度

Result: 在数学推理、编程和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来更稳定高效的更新，提升推理性能和生成质量

Conclusion: MaskGRPO建立了系统化的策略优化方法，是离散视觉扩散的首个实用解决方案

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型缺乏解释性，限制了其可信度和应用。XAI方法旨在提供模型决策过程的解释，但不同方法基于不同的哲学假设，这些假设对解释的有效性有重要影响。

Method: 分析XAI方法中的本体论和认识论假设，研究这些假设如何影响AI解释在不同领域的有效性和解释。探讨技术变化如何对应不同的解释假设。

Conclusion: 在选择XAI方法时必须考虑其背后的本体论和认识论假设，需要根据具体应用领域选择和调整合适的XAI方法。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Motivation: 虽然反事实解释在可解释AI中是一个强大工具，但在基于规则的智能环境领域尚无成熟的生成方法，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了一个插件来扩展现有智能环境解释引擎，实现了针对该领域的反事实解释形式化和实现，并进行了用户研究(N=17)来评估生成的反事实解释与传统因果解释的效果。

Result: 用户偏好高度情境化：因果解释因其语言简洁性和在时间压力下的适用性更受青睐，而反事实解释因其可操作性内容在用户想要解决问题时更受偏好。

Conclusion: 本文为智能环境中的新型解释提供了实用框架，并为选择最有效解释类型提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Result: 实验结果显示，Transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现强劲，但在新颖或缺失规则上准确性急剧下降。标记级准确性与完整答案准确性之间的差距揭示了当前方法的根本局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为深度学习模型的推理机制提供了新见解，强调需要超越模式识别、实现稳健抽象推理的架构。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied

Result: 广泛评估显示CoDA在总体得分上取得显著提升，比竞争基线高出41.5%。

Conclusion: 可视化自动化的未来不在于孤立的代码生成，而在于集成的、协作的智能体工作流程。

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

TL;DR: 提出CCDD方法，在连续表示空间和离散标记空间的联合空间上定义多模态扩散过程，解决了连续扩散模型表达能力与训练性能之间的矛盾


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散模型理论上比离散扩散和循环变换器具有更强的表达能力，但实际性能较差，主要原因是连续表示到离散标记空间的解码困难

Method: 提出协同进化连续离散扩散(CCDD)，在连续表示空间和离散标记空间的联合空间上定义多模态扩散过程，使用单一模型同时在联合空间中进行去噪

Result: CCDD在连续潜在空间中具有丰富的语义表达能力，同时通过显式离散标记的帮助获得了良好的可训练性和样本质量

Conclusion: CCDD在真实世界语言建模任务中展现出强大的实证性能，证明了联合连续-离散扩散方法的有效性

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

*Junru Hua,Rahul Ahluwalia,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于极值预测的数据增强框架，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强方法，使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步预测，特别关注极端区域的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极值预测在金融和气候变化等领域具有重要应用价值，但面临数据不平衡的挑战。研究旨在探索数据增强方法如何改善极值预测性能。

Method: 使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步预测，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强技术，并提出了基于相关性函数的极值数据增强策略。

Result: SMOTE-based策略在短期和长期预测中表现最佳，Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据中表现更好，BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中表现更优。

Conclusion: 数据增强特别是SMOTE方法能有效提升极值预测性能，不同深度学习模型在不同类型数据中各有优势，需要根据数据特性选择合适的模型。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

TL;DR: OpenTSLM是一个时间序列语言模型家族，通过将时间序列作为原生模态集成到预训练LLMs中，解决了LLMs无法处理时间序列的局限性。该研究提出了两种架构：SoftPrompt（隐式建模）和Flamingo（显式建模），在多个医疗时间序列推理任务中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域具有巨大潜力，但主要限制是无法处理时间序列数据。为了克服这一差距，需要开发能够原生理解时间序列的模型，以支持临床决策和数字健康应用。

Method: 提出了两种OpenTSLM架构：1) OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt：通过软提示将可学习的时间序列标记与文本标记连接；2) OpenTSLM-Flamingo：通过交叉注意力机制集成时间序列和文本。在三个数据集（HAR-CoT、Sleep-CoT、ECG-QA-CoT）上进行了基准测试。

Result: OpenTSLM模型在所有任务中均优于基线方法，在睡眠分期任务中达到69.9 F1，在HAR任务中达到65.4 F1，而仅微调的纯文本模型分别为9.05和52.2。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM模型也超过了GPT-4o的性能。OpenTSLM-Flamingo在长序列上表现更好，且内存需求稳定。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功地将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，显著提升了时间序列推理能力。显式建模方法在性能和内存效率方面优于隐式方法，为医疗时间序列分析提供了有效的解决方案。所有代码、数据集和模型均已开源。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段架构解决雷达数据到地面降雨的转换问题，显著提升了降雨场重建的精度和结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑，无法捕捉尖锐过渡和局域极值，这对于洪水预报、水文建模和气候分析至关重要。

Method: RainSeer采用物理信息驱动的两阶段架构：结构到点映射器通过双向映射将中尺度雷达结构投影到局域地面降雨，地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降过程中的语义转变。

Result: 在两个公共数据集（RAIN-F和MeteoNet）上的评估显示，RainSeer相比最先进基线方法，MAE降低了超过13.31%，并显著提升了重建降雨场的结构保真度。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理结构先验，成功解决了从高分辨率体积雷达场到稀疏点降雨观测的转换问题，为降雨场重建提供了更准确和结构保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Advisor Models是一种轻量级参数化策略，通过强化学习训练，能够对黑盒模型进行动态的自然语言引导，相比静态提示优化具有更好的适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型通常以黑盒服务形式部署，无法修改模型权重，只能通过提示进行定制。静态提示优化产生固定的提示，无法适应不同的输入、用户或环境。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略（Advisor Models），在输入和黑盒模型之间插入第二个小模型，根据环境奖励信号对每个实例进行行为塑造。

Result: 在涉及推理和个性化的多个领域，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能够发现环境动态并提高下游任务性能。同时展示了模型间的可迁移性和在保持对分布外输入鲁棒性的同时实现专业化的能力。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，其中顾问充当参数化、环境特定的记忆。通过Advisor Models对黑盒模型进行动态优化是实现个性化和环境适应性AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于预测市场的训练数据选择方法，统一处理多种信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），通过单一流动性参数控制集中度，在固定计算预算下实现高效数据筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据选择方法需要手动组合多种异质信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），缺乏统一框架和透明控制参数。

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场（LMSR）为每个样本定价，信号作为交易者，通过价格-每令牌规则处理令牌预算，并加入轻量级多样性头提高覆盖度。

Result: 在GSM8K（60k令牌预算）上达到与强基线相当的性能，同时降低种子方差，选择开销<0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews上保持竞争性准确率的同时改善平衡性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架在固定计算预算下统一了多信号数据筛选，适用于提示级推理和分类任务，提供了透明的控制参数。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

Motivation: 在大数据集上训练现代神经网络计算和能耗密集，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 使用Frequent Directions草图在O(ℓD)内存中维护梯度几何，通过两遍、GPU友好的流水线消除N×N成对相似性和显式N×ℓ梯度存储。

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一种实用的、恒定内存的替代方案，可与剪枝和模型压缩互补，实现高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于不确定性的模型选择策略，用于优化生物分子功效预测的集成学习，通过选择预测不确定性最低的模型进行集成，在siRNA敲低功效任务中超越了专门的最先进预测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习器（如TabPFN）在生物分子功效预测中表现良好，但其性能高度依赖于提供的上下文。如何在没有真实标签的情况下选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放问题。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型和简单的基于序列的特征，通过模型预测的分位数间范围（IQR）作为不确定性度量，选择不确定性最低的模型进行集成平均。

Result: 在siRNA敲低功效任务中，该方法超越了专门的最先进预测器，模型的不确定性（IQR）与真实预测误差呈负相关，基于不确定性的集成方法优于朴素集成或使用所有数据训练的单一模型。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是一种强大的、无需标签的启发式方法，可用于优化生物分子功效预测。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因子化MDP方法需要已知因子表示，而深度强化学习无法利用因子结构。需要一种能从高维观测中自动发现可控因子的方法。

Method: 使用对比学习方法，利用动作稀疏性（每个动作只影响部分变量）来识别可独立控制的潜在状态组件。

Result: 在Taxi、FourRooms和MiniGrid-DoorKey三个基准测试中，ACF能够直接从像素观测中恢复真实的可控因子，性能优于基线解耦算法。

Conclusion: ACF成功解决了从高维观测中发现可控因子表示的问题，为结合因子化MDP和深度强化学习提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL虽然能从大数据中学习控制多参数系统，但在系统模型快速变化时性能会严重下降；而ES能处理时变系统但收敛速度慢且易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将DRL和ES结合形成混合控制器，DRL利用历史数据快速控制多参数系统，ES确保对时变性的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过单独使用任一方法，在洛斯阿拉莫斯中子科学中心线性粒子加速器的低能束流传输段自动调谐中进行了数值研究验证。

Conclusion: DRL和ES的结合产生了协同效应，既保持了DRL的学习能力，又增强了系统对时变性的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了监督微调与逆强化学习的等价性，证明SFT不仅是策略模仿，还隐含学习了一个密集的token级奖励模型，并提出Dense-Path REINFORCE方法利用该奖励模型进一步提升策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，证明SFT不仅仅是简单的模仿学习过程，而是与逆强化学习存在根本等价性，能够学习到隐式的密集奖励模型。

Method: 建立SFT与逆Q学习的等价关系，从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号，提出Dense-Path REINFORCE方法利用这些奖励通过强化学习进一步优化策略。

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE方法在指令跟随基准测试中一致优于原始SFT模型，证明了恢复的密集奖励模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 重新定义了SFT不仅是策略模仿，更是一种强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示数据开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差学习框架，通过在多块交叉阵列上顺序学习来补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差，使有限状态（约4位）的模拟内存计算设备能够有效进行片上训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用电阻交叉阵列直接在内存中进行深度神经网络计算，但实际训练需要至少8位电导状态才能匹配数字基线。许多有前景的忆阻器件（如ReRAM）由于制造限制仅提供约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度严重降低了训练精度。

Method: 提出残差学习框架，在多块交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习，补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差。理论分析显示最优性差距随瓦片数量减少，并实现线性收敛速率。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的模拟内存训练策略，成本分析确认仅产生适度的硬件开销。

Conclusion: 该残差学习框架能够有效解决有限状态忆阻器件的训练精度问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了Spectral Geodesic Flow Matching (SFMG)框架，通过谱嵌入将图映射到黎曼流形，利用测地流匹配生成图，在保持性能的同时实现30倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐谱或度分布，忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入图和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形，定义嵌入间的测地流，并沿这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，SFMG在图元、度和谱指标上达到最先进方法的性能，比基于扩散的模型快30倍，并能泛化到未见过的图规模。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了新方法，在可扩展性和训练效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于动物间变换类(IATC)的模型-大脑比较方法，通过双向映射评估神经网络模型作为大脑机制模型的准确性，解决了模型预测性与机制识别之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏比较模型激活与大脑响应的共识方法，需要建立更严格的比较标准来评估神经网络模型作为大脑机制模型的有效性。

Method: 使用IATC方法，通过识别动物群体中准确映射神经响应所需的最严格函数集，在模型响应与大脑数据之间建立双向映射，评估模型能否像典型被试一样表现。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的详细方面（如非线性激活函数），实现神经活动的高精度预测，同时获得机制识别的高特异性，能够区分不同脑区的响应模式。

Conclusion: IATC证明了模型预测性与机制识别之间不存在固有权衡，为模型-大脑比较提供了原则性方法，支持地形深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型的新证据。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Motivation: 需要从纵向可穿戴数据中学习紧凑的潜在表示，同时预测抑郁率并识别行为亚型，为临床提供可解释的风险解释。

Method: 使用基于注意力的GRU自编码器，联合优化三个目标：序列重构学习潜在表示、二元分类预测抑郁率、GMM软聚类识别行为亚型。

Result: 在372名参与者的睡眠数据上，聚类质量（轮廓分数0.70 vs 0.32-0.70）和抑郁分类（AUC 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67）均优于基线。跨年验证显示聚类可重复性（轮廓分数0.63，AUC 0.61）。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE在纵向可穿戴数据分析中表现出色，提供了临床可解释的亚型分析和时间注意力可视化，有助于理解睡眠规律变化与抑郁风险的关系。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Motivation: 尽管图神经网络取得显著进展，但其表达能力有限仍是基本挑战。现有研究尚未探索导数作为增强GNN表达能力的手段。

Method: 引入高阶导数GNN(HOD-GNN)，利用基础模型的高阶节点导数生成表达性结构感知节点嵌入，通过第二个GNN在端到端可训练架构中处理。

Conclusion: 高阶节点导数提供了一种增强GNN表达能力的自然方式，HOD-GNN在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型表达能力。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

TL;DR: MINTO提出了一种新的目标网络更新规则，通过取目标网络和在线网络估计的最小值来计算目标值，实现了快速稳定的价值函数学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标网络方法虽然稳定但学习缓慢，而直接使用在线网络作为目标会导致学习不稳定。MINTO旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 引入MINTO更新规则，计算目标值时取目标网络和在线网络估计的最小值，可无缝集成到各种基于价值和演员-评论家算法中。

Result: 在在线和离线强化学习、离散和连续动作空间等多种基准测试中，MINTO始终提升性能表现。

Conclusion: MINTO通过简单有效的修改，实现了更快更稳定的价值函数学习，具有广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征过滤器依赖统计成对依赖度量，但当目标依赖于高阶特征交互而非个体贡献时，这种方法会失效。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化互信息近似，通过精心设计的损失函数和稀疏正则化进行特征选择，采用两阶段过程解耦表示学习和特征选择。

Conclusion: MINERVA能够有效处理高阶特征交互，在特征选择中表现出优越性能，并能提供精确解。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for

Motivation: 解决AdaLoRA在训练过程中收敛速度慢和计算开销高的问题，同时保持动态秩分配的优势。

Method: 采用基于注意力机制的hypernetwork动态生成SVD参数(P, Λ, Q)，通过剪裁hypernetwork输出的奇异值实现动态秩分配。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，该方法实现了更快的收敛速度且不牺牲性能，在其他基于LoRA的方法上也具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过hypernetwork机制有效加速了AdaLoRA的收敛，为解决PEFT方法中的收敛效率问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Conclusion: 这是首个严格优化驱动式传感平台并提出专用检测车辆的研究，为桥梁健康监测提供了优化的检测车辆设计框架。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Motivation: 随着学生越来越多地使用LLMs作为学习辅助工具，需要开发能够处理辅导细微差别的模型，包括识别学生核心需求、适应性、个性化指导和准确性。

Method: 构建包含高中和AP课程内容的1,490个样本数据集，每个样本配有特定评分标准，使用LLM-judge和样本特定评分标准进行自动评估。

Result: 评估16个前沿LLMs，结果显示所有模型得分均低于56%，在辅导技能相关标准上的通过率低于60%。Claude模型在支持主动学习方面表现最佳，但在其他用例中落后。

Conclusion: 当前前沿LLMs在展示完整的辅导技能方面存在不足，TutorBench为开发下一代AI导师提供了全面且未饱和的基准。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

Method: 通过数学证明分析置换等变学习规则下神经元之间的映射关系，建立双Lipschitz约束条件，研究学习率临界点对拓扑结构的影响。

Result: 发现学习率存在临界点η*，低于该值时训练保持所有拓扑结构，高于该值时允许拓扑简化，使神经元流形逐渐粗糙化，降低模型表达能力。

Conclusion: 梯度下降下神经网络学习动态可分为两个阶段：拓扑约束下的平滑优化阶段和通过拓扑简化进行学习的阶段，该理论独立于具体架构和损失函数，具有普适性。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

Motivation: 预训练扩散模型能有效捕捉训练数据分布，但需要根据下游应用使用奖励函数来塑造这些分布。策略梯度方法在自回归生成中广泛应用，但扩散模型的边际似然难以处理。

Method: 统一RAFT变体为GRAFT框架，引入P-GRAFT在中间噪声水平塑造分布，提出逆噪声校正改进流模型。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、布局生成、分子生成和无条件图像生成等任务上验证。应用于Stable Diffusion 2时，在VQAScore上优于策略梯度方法，相对基础模型提升8.81%。无条件图像生成中，逆噪声校正以更低FLOPs/image改善FID。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架有效统一了RAFT变体，P-GRAFT通过中间噪声水平分布塑造实现更有效的微调，逆噪声校正可在无显式奖励情况下改进流模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

Motivation: 在安全关键领域，离线强化学习需要提供高回报且避免灾难性尾部风险。现有风险规避方法过于保守且限制策略类别，而表达性策略仅用于风险中性设置。

Method: RAMAC框架耦合表达性生成actor与分布critic，通过生成路径区分组合目标（分布风险和BC损失），在复杂多模态场景中实现风险敏感学习。

Result: 在Stochastic-D4RL任务上，使用扩散和流匹配actor的RAMAC在保持强回报的同时，在CVaR0.1指标上获得一致增益。

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了离线强化学习中风险敏感学习的问题，实现了表达性策略与风险规避的结合。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self
attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable

solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的鲁棒属性图聚类方法RAGC，通过混合协作增强(HCA)和对比样本自适应差异感知(CSADA)来解决现有对比属性图聚类方法在节点和边级别增强不平衡以及对比样本处理不充分的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比属性图聚类方法主要依赖边作为辅助信息获取节点级嵌入表示，仅关注节点级嵌入增强，忽视了边级嵌入增强以及不同粒度下节点级和边级嵌入增强的交互。同时，它们往往平等对待所有对比样本对，忽略了难易正负样本对之间的显著差异，限制了判别能力。

Method: RAGC方法包含两个核心模块：1) 混合协作增强(HCA)：同时执行节点级和边级嵌入表示与增强，建立更全面的相似性度量标准；2) 对比样本自适应差异感知(CSADA)：利用高置信度伪标签信息，自适应识别所有对比样本对，并通过创新的权重调制函数差异化处理它们。HCA和CSADA模块在良性循环中相互增强。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

TL;DR: TokenFlow是一个通过抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理来提升LLM流式文本生成性能的服务系统，在保持整体token吞吐量的同时显著提高了有效吞吐量和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统由于非抢占式请求调度和被动内存管理的僵化性，在请求突发时资源利用率低、处理并行度差，无法平衡流式token生成中的响应性（低TTFT）和稳定生成（合理TBT）两个目标。

Method: TokenFlow采用基于实时token缓冲区占用率和token消耗率的动态请求优先级调度，同时在后台主动在GPU和CPU内存间传输KV缓存，并通过I/O与计算重叠来最小化请求抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B模型及多种GPU上的实验表明，TokenFlow实现了高达82.5%的有效吞吐量提升，同时将P99 TTFT降低达80.2%，且不降低整体token吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的抢占式调度和主动KV缓存管理机制，显著提升了LLM流式服务的性能，为实时LLM交互提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor
satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS,
MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This
work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while
enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Motivation: 研究动机是探究常见的LLM安全干预措施（如拒绝训练或元标签训练）是否能在推理时激活编辑下保持有效性。

Method: 使用模型消融技术移除拒绝敏感方向，在SmolLM2-1.7B的安全预训练检查点上进行控制评估，对20个系统（原始和消融后）发出100个提示，使用多个评判者分类响应为拒绝或非拒绝。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的安全组件在消融下的鲁棒性各不相同，需要将推理时编辑纳入安全评估协议。

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么只能获得次优的O(1/√n)泛化率，要么需要假设平滑激活函数并导致对网络深度的指数依赖。本文旨在解决这一局限，为深度ReLU网络建立最优泛化率。

Method: 通过仔细权衡优化误差和泛化误差，在数据满足NTK可分离性假设下，提出了一种新的激活模式控制技术，为梯度下降训练的深度ReLU网络提供了更尖锐的Rademacher复杂度界。

Result: 证明了超额风险率为Õ(L⁴(1+γL²)/(nγ²))，这与最优SVM型率Õ(1/(nγ²))在深度依赖因子范围内对齐，仅对深度有多项式依赖。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为深度ReLU网络的梯度下降训练建立了最优泛化率，关键技术创新是对参考模型附近激活模式的新控制方法。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线共形预测方法在阈值更新步骤中只关注预测区间的有效性（真实值是否在区间内），而忽略了区间的相关性。本文旨在利用这一被忽视的方面来改进预测性能。

Method: 提出在阈值更新步骤中，用能够量化预测区间相关性的更广泛函数类替代二元评估（在区间内/外），这有助于防止阈值突变，可能产生更窄的预测区间。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，这些函数能够产生比现有OCP方法更紧的区间，同时保持覆盖有效性。

Conclusion: 通过考虑预测区间的相关性而不仅仅是有效性，可以改进在线共形预测方法，产生更窄的预测区间而不牺牲覆盖保证。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛使用，推理阶段的持续能耗已成为AI能源足迹的主要部分，但现有研究缺乏细粒度测量方法，无法准确评估组件级能耗。

Method: 提出CLEAR方法，通过重复采样解决微秒级组件执行与毫秒级能耗监测的时间不匹配问题，评估了15个不同架构的模型。

Result: 注意力块每FLOP消耗更多能量，能耗与FLOP计数不成比例；CLEAR方法能将组件级能耗方差控制在9.5%以下，捕获超过90%的总能耗。

Conclusion: FLOPs无法准确反映组件级真实能耗，需要建立详细的组件级能耗基准，通过组件级优化来构建节能的Transformer模型。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到伪相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移具有鲁棒性，但对组内分布偏移仍然脆弱，这在样本有限的少数群体中尤为常见。

Method: 提出了层次化扩展的Group DRO方法，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，为多层次的分布偏移提供鲁棒性。还引入了新的基准设置来模拟真实的少数群体分布偏移。

Result: 该方法在现有鲁棒学习方法持续失败的情况下表现出强大的鲁棒性，同时在标准基准测试中也实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，扩大模糊集以更好地捕捉组间和组内分布不确定性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Motivation: 随机顺序模型中的输入序列虽然渐近等价于独立同分布序列，但在有限时间内可能表现出显著的非平稳性，这会阻碍随机学习算法的性能。现有的对抗性输入算法在随机顺序中保持遗憾保证，但一些简单的无遗憾随机算法在随机顺序实例中会失效。

Method: 提出了一个通用模板来适配随机学习算法到随机顺序模型，通过分析随机顺序输入的特性来调整算法设计，使其在保持随机模型优势的同时适应非平稳性。

Result: 该模板成功应用于多个场景：延迟预测、带约束的在线学习和带切换成本的赌博机，恢复了改进的遗憾边界。此外，证明了在随机顺序模型中，在线分类的可学习性由VC维度而非Littlestone维度表征。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了随机顺序模型与随机模型之间的联系，提供了一个统一的框架来设计在随机顺序输入下表现良好的算法，并揭示了随机顺序模型在在线分类中的独特性质。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art

efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列任务时需要平衡表达能力和计算负担，核心挑战是在最大化表达能力的同时限制计算成本。

Method: 基于控制理论中的Hankel奇异值分析，在训练过程中识别高能量状态维度并进行平衡截断，适用于线性时不变SSM和选择性模型。

Result: 训练中降维显著加速优化过程，压缩模型保留了任务关键结构，性能优于直接训练的小维度模型。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练过程中缩小的SSM能够实现计算效率，同时保持更高的性能表现。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

Conclusion: VAR作为迭代优化框架提供了新的理论视角，解释了其性能优势，建立了与扩散模型的联系，并为实际应用提供了扩展可能性和工具接口。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

Conclusion: SASL框架在保持高可解释性的同时实现了与黑盒方法相当的预测准确性，为临床实践提供了清晰可操作的见解。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over

*Aleksei Arzhantsev,Otmane Sakhi,Flavian Vasile*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RoiRL方法，一种轻量级的离线强化学习替代方案，用于改进大语言模型的推理能力，无需真实奖励标签，训练速度比现有方法快2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要真实奖励信号，而测试时强化学习(TTRL)虽然使用多数投票奖励但计算成本高，需要在线RL和参考模型。

Method: RoiRL采用离线迭代强化学习，优化加权对数似然目标，无需维护参考模型，显著降低内存和计算需求。

Result: 实验结果显示RoiRL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: RoiRL为无标签的自改进大语言模型提供了可扩展的路径，实现了更高效的推理能力提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMark是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的水印框架，通过三种互补策略解决传统水印方法在非顺序解码模型上的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型提供比自回归模型更快的生成速度，但现有水印方法因其非顺序解码特性而失效，需要专门的水印解决方案。

Method: DMark采用三种策略：预测水印（使用模型预测的token）、双向水印（利用扩散解码的前后依赖关系）、以及预测-双向水印（结合两者最大化检测强度）。

Result: 实验显示DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，而现有方法仅49.6-71.2%，同时保持文本质量。

Conclusion: DMark证明了对非自回归语言模型进行有效水印是可行的，且具有抗文本操作的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的细胞分化动态建模方法依赖计算昂贵的预处理和多阶段训练，且无法发现明确的基因相互作用。

Method: 提出Cell-MNN编码器-解码器架构，其潜在表示是控制从干细胞到组织细胞演化动力学的局部线性化ODE，完全端到端训练（除标准PCA预处理外）。

Result: 在单细胞基准测试中实现竞争性性能，在扩展到更大数据集和跨多个数据集联合训练方面超越现有基线，学习到的可解释基因相互作用与TRRUST数据库验证一致。

Conclusion: Cell-MNN提供了一种可扩展且可解释的方法来建模细胞分化动力学，同时学习生物学一致的基因相互作用。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Motivation: 解决非IID环境下联邦学习的性能下降和公平性问题，特别是针对表现不佳的客户端进行优化。

Method: 结合多类AdaBoost算法的权重机制，为错误率较低的客户端分配更高权重；同时动态增强表现不佳的客户端，通过调整焦点损失参数来强调难以分类的样本。

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10三个基准数据集上的实验表明，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto实现了更好的公平性和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: FeDABoost框架有效提升了非IID环境下联邦学习的公平性和整体性能，为联邦学习的实际应用提供了有价值的解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Motivation: 医疗时间序列分析面临数据稀疏、噪声大和记录长度变化大的挑战，现有方法在处理可变长度信号和提供可解释性方面存在不足。

Method: 将随机稀疏采样框架推广到检索增强分类，通过通道内相似度加权窗口预测，在概率空间进行聚合，生成凸序列级分数和明确的证据轨迹。

Result: 在四个医疗中心收集的iEEG记录上评估，实现了有竞争力的分类性能，并为从业者提供了更高的透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在可靠和可解释的临床可变长度时间序列分类方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

Conclusion: 本文成功将风险度量理论扩展到持续强化学习设置，提出的遍历风险度量为风险感知的持续学习提供了可行的理论框架。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Motivation: 随着全球海运增长，能源优化对降低成本和提高运营效率至关重要。轴功率直接影响燃料消耗，但高质量传感器数据获取困难且成本高，午报数据成为可行替代方案。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，先在船舶高频数据上预训练模型，然后用其他船舶的低频每日午报数据进行微调。测试对象包括姐妹船、相似船和不同船。

Result: 相比仅使用午报数据训练的模型，该方法使平均绝对百分比误差在姐妹船上降低10.6%，相似船上降低3.6%，不同船上降低5.3%。

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Motivation: 在真实部署场景中，当测试数据没有标签时，评估模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力至关重要。

Method: 利用模型预测的两个内在属性——置信度（反映预测确定性）和分散度（捕获预测类别的多样性），构建了基于置信度、分散度和混合指标的评估方法。

Result: 混合指标在数据集中心和模型中心评估设置中均优于单方面指标，特别是预测矩阵的核范数在各种任务中表现稳健准确。

Conclusion: 该研究为部署场景中的无监督模型评估提供了一个实用且可泛化的基础。

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究不精确监督问题的框架，能有效处理各种形式的不精确标签，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Conclusion: CHORD框架成功实现了无需反向传播的个性化混合精度量化，在保持推荐准确性的同时显著降低了通信开销和计算负担。

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Conclusion: 该分布框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够有效捕捉专家行为的复杂结构。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC
and TQC. Results show that Parameterized Action Greedy Actor-Critic (PAGAC)
outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest
returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform
game and 24:04 for the Robot Soccer Goal game. Its speed and stability provide
clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC
demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks
requiring rapid convergence and robust performance. Future work could explore
hybrid strategies combining entropy-regularization with truncation-based
methods to enhance stability and expand investigations into generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wasserstein重心在机器学习、统计学和计算机图形学中有广泛应用，但实际输入数据来自敏感数据集，需要差分隐私保护。

Method: 开发了差分隐私算法来计算Wasserstein重心，确保在计算过程中保护数据隐私。

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these
input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets,
motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our
knowledge, the first algorithms for computing Wasserstein barycenters under
differential privacy. Empirically, on synthetic data, MNIST, and large-scale
U.S. population datasets, our methods produce high-quality private barycenters
with strong accuracy-privacy tradeoffs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的双解码器深度强化学习框架UD3RL，用于解决接近旅行商问题，通过分离节点选择和路径点确定两个子任务，在解质量和运行时间上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习在解决旅行商问题方面取得了进展，但对接近旅行商问题的研究有限，主要挑战在于其基于邻域的访问标准，即智能体进入节点紧凑邻域即视为访问该节点。

Method: 使用离散化方案构建马尔可夫决策过程，提出统一双解码器DRL框架，包含节点解码器和位置解码器分别处理两个子任务，采用k近邻子图交互策略增强空间推理，使用定制的REINFORCE算法进行训练。

Result: UD3RL在解质量和运行时间上均优于传统方法，在不同问题规模、空间分布和半径范围内表现出强泛化能力，对动态环境具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UD3RL框架有效解决了接近旅行商问题，展示了在复杂组合优化问题中的优越性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于平衡符号图的轻量级Transformer式神经网络，用于区分癫痫患者和健康受试者的EEG信号分类，通过展开谱去噪算法实现高效分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号样本具有固有的反相关性，可以通过符号图中的负边很好地建模。为了使用EEG信号区分癫痫患者和健康受试者，需要构建轻量级且可解释的神经网络。

Method: 通过展开平衡符号图上的谱去噪算法构建轻量级Transformer式神经网络，利用Lanczos近似在映射的正图上高效实现理想低通滤波器，其中最优截止频率从数据中学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在EEG信号分类上达到了与代表性深度学习方案相当的性能，同时使用了显著更少的参数。

Conclusion: 提出的基于平衡符号图的轻量级神经网络在EEG信号分类任务中表现优异，在保持分类性能的同时大幅减少了模型参数，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于分数蒸馏的方法，显著加速蛋白质骨架生成过程，在保持生成质量的同时实现20倍以上的采样速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在蛋白质骨架生成中采样速度慢的问题，传统方法需要数百次迭代步骤，限制了在大规模蛋白质发现中的实际应用。

Method: 采用分数身份蒸馏(SiD)技术，结合多步生成和推理时噪声调制，训练少步蛋白质骨架生成器。

Result: 蒸馏后的少步生成器实现了超过20倍的采样速度提升，同时在可设计性、多样性和新颖性方面与原始Proteina教师模型保持相当水平。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际的蛋白质工程应用，实现了大规模计算机蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯等变神经网络为开发具有不确定性感知能力的大规模原子模拟机器学习势提供了强大框架。

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Motivation: 解决量化金融中深度学习方法因目标不匹配和误差放大而失败的问题，实现稳健的资产分配。

Method: 使用路径签名对资产动态进行几何表示，并采用签名增强的注意力机制嵌入金融归纳偏差（如领先滞后效应）。

Conclusion: 投资组合感知的目标和几何感知的归纳偏差对于机器学习系统中的风险感知资本分配至关重要。

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在组合优化问题上难以超越传统优化方法，限制了其实际应用。本文旨在解决图对齐这一NP难问题，寻找仅基于结构信息的无标签图间最优节点对应关系。

Method: 训练一系列GNN网络，每个网络学习迭代优化前一个网络生成的相似度矩阵。推理时产生自举效应：每个GNN通过整合先前迭代中节点对齐质量的离散排序信息来改进部分解。结合在节点对上操作的强大架构，捕获标准消息传递网络无法表示的全局结构模式。

Result: 在合成基准测试中取得显著改进：链式GNN在挑战性实例上的准确率比现有方法提高3倍以上，并唯一解决了所有竞争方法都失败的规则图。与传统优化后处理结合后，在图对齐基准上大幅优于最先进的求解器。

Conclusion: 链式GNN方法成功克服了GNN在组合优化问题上的局限性，为图对齐问题提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了性能并解决了传统方法难以处理的实例。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于图神经网络的自适应节点特征选择方法，通过在训练过程中识别并移除不必要的特征来提高模型性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据引入了复杂的依赖关系，传统特征重要性度量方法可能不适用。需要一种能够衡量特征对模型输出贡献的方法，用于解释决策、降低维度，甚至通过消除无用变量来提高性能。

Method: 提出了一种模型和任务无关的方法，基于在验证集上对特征值进行置换后性能变化来确定相关特征。通过理论分析表征GNN性能如何依赖于节点数据和图结构之间的关系。

Result: 该方法不仅能在训练结束后返回特征重要性分数，还能跟踪特征重要性随特征逐步移除的演化过程。经验结果验证了该方法对不同图架构的灵活性以及对更具挑战性的图学习场景的适应性。

Conclusion: 提出的干预式特征选择方法能够有效识别图神经网络中的相关特征，提高模型性能和可解释性，适用于各种图学习任务和架构。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

TL;DR: AdaBet是一种无梯度的层选择方法，通过分析激活空间的拓扑特征来识别重要层，用于在资源受限设备上进行高效的神经网络重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上利用预训练神经网络时，需要适应特定用户的数据分布，但受限于计算和内存资源。现有方法依赖标签数据、完整反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适合受限设备。

Method: 使用Betti Numbers分析激活空间的拓扑特征，仅通过前向传播来评估层的重要性，无需标签或梯度。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上的评估显示，AdaBet比基于梯度的方法平均分类准确率提高5%，平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种高效的无梯度层选择方法，能够在资源受限设备上实现更好的模型适应性能。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Conclusion: VGB通过理论基础的随机游走和回溯机制，有效提高了对验证器错误的鲁棒性，为过程引导的测试时采样提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Motivation: 利用高速率量化理论假设来研究MoE模型在回归任务中的理论特性，特别是当专家数量足够大时输入空间区域变得很小的情况。

Method: 基于高速率量化理论假设，定义MoE模型为输入空间分割到多个区域，每个区域使用单参数专家作为常数预测器。研究一维和多维输入的近似误差最小化问题。

Result: 为一维输入制定了测试误差及其最小化分割和专家参数；为多维输入制定了测试误差上界并研究其最小化；分析了给定输入空间分割时专家参数的学习特性。

Conclusion: 理论和实证表明MoE学习中近似误差与估计误差的权衡取决于专家数量，为MoE模型的理论分析提供了新的视角。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Conclusion: 通过关注校准误差的主动学习策略能够有效提升深度神经网络在主动学习中的性能，特别是在处理未校准不确定性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Method: 提出广义(L0,L1)-平滑度条件来约束局部曲率，证明该条件适用于常见神经网络架构。在此假设下，分析带预热策略的梯度下降算法，并与固定步长方法进行理论比较。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，在广义平滑度条件下，带预热策略的梯度下降比固定步长方法收敛更快，建立了上下界复杂度分析。在语言和视觉模型上的实验证实了预热策略的实际效益。

Conclusion: 学习率预热通过缓解训练初期的高曲率问题来改善收敛性能，本文提供了严格的理论解释和实证支持，为这一常用启发式方法奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

TL;DR: FTTE是一个新颖的半异步联邦学习框架，通过稀疏参数更新和基于年龄与方差的加权聚合，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了更快的收敛速度、更低的内存使用和通信负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在分布式设备上实现协作模型训练的同时保护数据隐私，但在资源受限的边缘节点部署面临内存、能量和通信带宽限制。传统的同步和异步方法在异构大规模网络中受到慢节点延迟和收敛缓慢的影响。

Method: 提出FTTE框架，采用稀疏参数更新和基于客户端更新年龄与方差的加权聚合机制，实现半异步联邦学习。

Result: 在包含500个客户端和90%慢节点的多样化模型和数据分布实验中，FTTE比同步联邦学习（如FedAVG）收敛速度快81%，设备内存使用降低80%，通信负载减少69%，并且在挑战性场景下达到与半异步方法（如FedBuff）相当或更高的目标精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个在异构和主要资源受限的边缘设备上实现实际可扩展的联邦学习部署解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

Motivation: 解决非平稳强化学习中的分布漂移问题，传统QUCB算法在分布变化后可能利用次优奖励，需要开发能够检测并适应分布变化的算法。

Method: 提出Density-QUCB算法，使用转移密度函数检测分布漂移，利用其似然改进Q-learning UCB的不确定性估计质量。

Result: 理论上证明DQUCB比QUCB具有更好的遗憾保证；实证上在RL任务和COVID-19患者医院分配任务中表现出更低的遗憾和更好的计算效率。

Conclusion: DQUCB算法能够有效检测分布漂移，在非平稳强化学习环境中实现更好的探索-利用平衡，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 研究叠加假设与对齐度量之间的相互作用，验证不同叠加排列是否会干扰预测映射度量，导致对齐分数低于预期值。

Method: 开发了严格置换度量依赖叠加排列的理论，训练稀疏自编码器在玩具模型中解耦叠加，测试DNN→DNN和DNN→大脑线性回归对齐。

Result: 当用稀疏过完备潜在代码替换基础神经元时，对齐分数通常会增加；在视觉领域的DNN→DNN和DNN→大脑线性回归对齐中也观察到类似增长。

Conclusion: 叠加解耦对于映射度量揭示神经代码间真实表征对齐是必要的。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计主观疲劳程度(RPE)可以通过个性化反馈和预防伤害来增强抗阻训练效果。

Method: 使用可穿戴惯性传感器和肌电图(EMG)传感器收集数据，构建包含69组、超过1000次重复的自定义数据集，提取统计特征训练机器学习模型。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，精确准确率为41.4%，±1 RPE准确率为85.9%。离心重复时间是最强的RPE预测因子，EMG数据的加入仅略微提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 结果证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计的可行性，并指出了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

*Qiwei Di,Kaixuan Ji,Xuheng Li,Heyang Zhao,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM推理策略Best-of-Majority (BoM)，结合了多数投票和Best-of-N的优势，在Pass@k设置下实现了最优的推理扩展性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM推理策略如多数投票和Best-of-N在困难任务中表现不佳，特别是在Pass@k评估设置下缺乏理想的扩展性能。

Method: 提出Best-of-Majority (BoM)策略，首先将候选限制在高频响应中，然后选择前k个奖励最高的响应。

Result: 理论证明当采样预算N=Ω̃(C*)时，BoM的遗憾为O(ε_opt + √(ε_RM²C*/k))，且建立了匹配的下界，证明算法是最小最大最优的。实验结果显示BoM在数学问题推理中优于多数投票和BoN。

Conclusion: BoM策略在Pass@k推理设置下实现了最优的扩展性能，且性能不会随N增加而下降，是一种有效的LLM推理策略。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

Conclusion: 提出了有效利用特权信息的新指导原则，有望提升部分可观测领域中策略学习的效率。

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

Motivation: RLVR在复杂推理中推动了大语言模型的发展，但训练过程中性能会因策略熵崩溃而停滞。现有方法通常通过保持高策略熵来应对，但未深入探索有意义的探索机制。

Method: 引入低概率正则化（Lp-Reg），通过构建启发式代理分布来正则化策略，过滤噪声标记并重新归一化剩余候选者的分布，从而保护有价值的推理标记不被消除。

Conclusion: Lp-Reg通过保护推理标记实现了持续的探索，解决了RLVR训练中的探索瓶颈问题，取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

Abstract: The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an
image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation
process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation
or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation
error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free
algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight
steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our
algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8
steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation
model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also
generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than
the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We
validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO
2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and
17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further,
it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID
performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in
five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID
performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61,
respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED
Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the
state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We
also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps,
whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation
algorithm. The code is in repo:

Abstract: The visualization of 3D point cloud data is essential in fields such as
autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, where
tasks like object recognition, structural analysis, and spatiotemporal
exploration rely on clear and effective visual representation. Despite
advancements in AI-driven processing, visualization remains a critical tool for
interpreting complex spatial datasets. However, designing effective point cloud
visualizations presents significant challenges due to the sparsity, density
variations, and scale of the data. In this work, we analyze the design space of
spatial point cloud visualization, highlighting a gap in systematically mapping
visualization techniques to analytical objectives. We introduce a taxonomy that
categorizes four decades of visualization design choices, linking them to
fundamental challenges in modern applications. By structuring visualization
