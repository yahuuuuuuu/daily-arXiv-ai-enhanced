<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在真实临床环境中的质量仍不足，而大型视觉语言模型在通用领域通过采用LLM训练策略取得了显著进展。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)框架，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需额外训练数据或人工标注。

Result: 在三个最先进模型上补充使用随机DPO后，临床性能指标提升高达5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升放射学报告生成的准确性，且具有模型无关性和无需额外数据的优势。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

### [2] [Improving Autism Detection with Multimodal Behavioral Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21352)
*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态行为分析的自闭症谱系障碍诊断方法，通过改进眼动特征描述符，在168名ASC患者和157名非自闭症参与者的标准化视频数据集上实现了74%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机辅助自闭症诊断方法存在眼动特征性能差和缺乏现实世界泛化能力的问题，需要开发更有效的多模态分析方法。

Method: 使用标准化视频数据集进行多模态分析，包括面部表情、语音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和眼动行为。引入新的统计描述符量化眼动角度变异性，并采用后期融合方法整合多模态特征。

Result: 改进的眼动描述符将基于眼动的分类准确率从64%提升到69%，多模态融合后整体分类准确率达到74%，与临床研究中关于ASC患者注视回避的发现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了基于视频的多模态行为分析在开发可扩展的自闭症筛查工具方面的潜力，能够支持自闭症评估过程。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一个模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过选择性保留高效用上下文来解决VLA模型在长序列推理时的KV内存增长问题，实现推理加速和内存减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在长序列推理时面临注意力二次成本和KV内存无限增长的问题，现有方法在提升泛化能力时往往忽略了推理效率，这对实时部署至关重要。

Method: 将KV缓存分区为固定大小的块，使用循环门控模块根据学习的效用分数来总结和过滤历史上下文，保留近期细粒度细节，同时积极修剪过时的低相关性内存。

Result: 理论上可实现1.21倍推理加速和36% KV内存减少，对任务成功率影响最小，能够无缝集成到现有的自回归和混合VLA堆栈中。

Conclusion: KV-Efficient VLA提供了一种轻量级、训练友好的内存压缩机制，在不修改训练流程或下游控制逻辑的情况下实现可扩展推理。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于短语的事实核查模型，用于检测自动生成的胸部X光报告中事实错误和幻觉，通过合成数据集和多标签跨模态对比回归网络实现高精度验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告存在事实错误和幻觉，阻碍了其临床转化应用。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的发现和位置创建合成数据集，训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络进行事实核查。

Result: 在多个X光数据集上表现出强大的发现真实性预测和定位准确性，与基于真实标签的验证达到0.997的一致性相关系数。

Conclusion: 该方法在放射学工作流程的临床推理中具有实用价值，能够有效检测SOTA报告生成器的错误。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态深度学习架构MDF-MLLM，通过融合视网膜眼底图像的细粒度特征和全局文本上下文，显著提高了疾病分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型难以捕捉视网膜疾病诊断所需的关键低层空间细节，如青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变和视网膜色素变性等疾病。

Method: MDF-MLLM将U-Net编码器四层的跳跃特征集成到LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块中，采用补丁级投影、缩放交叉注意力和基于FiLM的U-Net调制进行特征融合。

Result: 在1,305个眼底图像-文本对数据集上，MDF-MLLM实现了94%的分类准确率，比基线MLLM的60%提高了56%，召回率和F1分数分别提升了67%和35%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM为眼底图像分类提供了一个可泛化、可解释和模块化的框架，通过多尺度特征融合超越了传统MLLM基线，有望在临床决策支持系统中部署应用。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态提示解耦攻击(MPDA)，利用图像模态分离不安全提示的有害语义组件，通过伪安全提示绕过安全过滤器生成NSFW内容


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法主要操纵文本提示，图像输入漏洞未被充分探索，且文本方法难以绕过模型安全过滤器

Method: 使用LLM将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示，将有害提示重写为自然对抗提示，通过视觉语言模型生成图像描述确保语义一致性

Result: MPDA能够有效绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器生成NSFW内容

Conclusion: 多模态方法在绕过安全过滤器方面比纯文本方法更有效，揭示了T2I模型在图像输入方面的安全漏洞

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过结合显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测的多任务监督方法，解决显著目标检测中预测不完整和边界不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在显著目标检测中仍存在预测不完整（由于物体内部复杂性）和边界不准确（由于卷积和池化操作的步幅）的问题。

Method: 1. 将显著目标检测和前景轮廓检测任务交织训练，生成均匀高亮的显著图；2. 前景轮廓和边缘检测任务相互指导，提高轮廓精度并减少边缘噪声；3. 开发了新的互学习模块（MLM），通过多分支网络进行互学习训练。

Result: 在七个具有挑战性的数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测方面都取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 通过多任务监督和互学习机制，有效解决了显著目标检测中的预测不完整和边界不准确问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MAJORScore，一种用于评估多模态（≥3个模态）相关性的新指标，通过多模态联合表示实现公平的相关性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相关性评估指标仅适用于双模态分析，限制了多模态相似性的评估。需要一种能够处理三个及以上模态的相关性评估方法。

Method: 利用多模态联合表示将多个模态整合到同一潜在空间中，在一个尺度上准确表示不同模态，为公平的相关性评分提供支持。

Result: 实验表明，MAJORScore在一致性模态上比现有方法提升26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低13.28%-20.54%。

Conclusion: MAJORScore是评估大规模多模态数据集相似性和多模态模型性能的更可靠指标。

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发基于AI的云平台，通过点云数据分析自动检测脚手架结构变化，替代人工视觉检查以提高安全性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脚手架安全检查依赖人工视觉检查，耗时且容易出错，存在安全隐患，需要更准确高效的自动化检测方法

Method: 开发云AI平台，通过对比认证参考数据和最新点云数据来检测脚手架结构变化

Result: 系统能够自动监测脚手架结构修改，减少人工检查时间和工作量

Conclusion: AI和数字化方法能够显著提高脚手架安全检查的准确性和效率，有助于改善施工现场安全

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动提示工程框架，用于生成反事实尺寸的图像（如微小海象与巨大按钮），通过图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练的排序器来优化提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中细粒度可控性的挑战，特别是反事实可控性（生成违背常识模式的图像），这对于创意和探索性应用至关重要。

Method: 构建了首个反事实尺寸文本-图像数据集，开发了包含三个组件的框架：图像评估器（基于改进的Grounded SAM）、监督提示重写器和DPO训练的排序器。

Result: 图像评估器性能比骨干网络提升114%，实验表明该方法优于现有最先进基线和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该方法为反事实可控性的未来研究奠定了基础，在反事实图像生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了两种深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)在非荧光相位调制显微镜中实现超分辨率成像的性能，发现它们在不同信噪比条件下具有互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光学显微镜横向分辨率限制(~200nm)的问题，避免使用昂贵的外部模块或专门的超分辨率荧光显微镜技术，为普通显微镜用户提供经济可行的超分辨率解决方案。

Method: 使用两种先前开发的深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)，在自定义制造的纳米尺度测试目标上进行评估，该目标通过原子力显微镜进行校准。比较两种模型在不同图像信噪比条件下的超分辨率性能。

Result: 两种模型在超分辨率成像方面表现良好，但具有互补性：高信噪比图像适合使用O-Net模型，低信噪比图像更适合Theta-Net模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构与源图像信噪比对深度神经网络在非荧光光学纳米显微镜中的性能至关重要，即使使用相同的训练数据集和训练周期，不同架构在不同条件下表现各异。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMTF-AVN方法，通过多目标架构和改进的Transformer机制，在视听导航中实现动态多目标融合，在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视听导航中有效利用多模态线索的挑战，现有方法往往忽视更深层次的感知上下文。

Method: 使用多目标架构配合改进的Transformer机制，过滤和选择性融合跨模态信息。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上实现最先进性能，在成功率(SR)、路径效率(SPL)和场景适应性(SNA)方面超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 模型展现出强大的可扩展性和泛化能力，为机器人导航中的先进多模态融合策略铺平了道路。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

### [13] [SAEmnesia: Erasing Concepts in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21379)
*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化概念标注促进一对一概念-神经元映射，显著减少文本到图像扩散模型中概念遗忘所需的超参数搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器虽然减少了神经元多义性，但单个概念表示仍分布在多个潜在特征中，需要大量搜索过程进行概念遗忘。

Method: 引入监督式稀疏自编码器训练，通过系统化概念标注缓解特征分裂并促进特征集中化，学习具有更强概念关联的专用神经元。

Result: 在UnlearnCanvas基准测试中比现有技术提升9.22%；推理时超参数搜索减少96.67%；在9对象移除的顺序遗忘任务中，遗忘准确率提升28.4%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过促进一对一概念-神经元映射，显著提高了概念遗忘的效率和准确性，具有优越的可扩展性。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在生物医学图像分类中需要大量计算资源和时间，特别是超参数搜索需要多轮训练。随机采样选择核心集会损害数据集代表性，在类别不平衡时偏向主导类，且无法捕捉类内多样性。

Method: 提出智能核心集选择机制，提取类内多样性，形成每类聚类，然后基于这些聚类进行最终采样，确保核心集能代表原始数据集的特征。

Result: 在知名生物医学成像数据集上的分类实验表明，该方法在多个性能指标上优于随机采样方法，在相同条件下表现更好。

Conclusion: 所提出的智能核心集选择方法能有效减少深度学习模型训练的计算需求，同时保持模型性能，为大规模数据集训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

### [15] [The LongiMam model for improved breast cancer risk prediction using longitudinal mammograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21383)
*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，通过整合当前和最多四个既往乳腺X光片，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络来捕捉预测乳腺癌的空间和时间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单次或有限的既往乳腺X光片，且缺乏对现实世界中结果分布不平衡和随访异质性的适应。

Method: 开发LongiMam模型，结合卷积神经网络（捕捉空间模式）和循环神经网络（捕捉时间模式），使用大型人群筛查数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 在多个场景下，包含既往乳腺X光片时LongiMam始终改善预测性能，既往和当前检查的组合优于单次检查模型。在乳腺密度随时间变化的女性中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强了乳腺癌预测能力，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来优化风险分层。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究CNN与人类大脑在社交认知任务中的对应关系，发现CNN难以超越简单视觉处理，无法反映高阶大脑处理。提出了Object2Brain框架来分析不同对象类别对CNN-人类相关性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CNN与人类大脑在复杂社交认知任务（如图像情感评估）中的对应关系，而不仅仅是基础视觉感知。

Method: 通过相关性分析评估CNN架构与人类行为数据和fMRI数据的对齐程度，并提出Object2Brain框架结合GradCAM和对象检测来分析对象类别的影响。

Result: CNN在社交认知任务中难以超越简单视觉处理，不同CNN架构显示出不同的对象类别敏感性。

Conclusion: CNN在复杂社交认知任务中与人类大脑的对应关系有限，需要更先进的模型来捕捉高阶脑处理过程。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架CBDebug，通过移除和重训练两个步骤来修复概念瓶颈模型中的系统性偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念干预方法无法解决模型与专家推理之间的系统性偏差问题，比如模型从有偏数据中学习捷径。

Method: 采用移除和重训练两阶段框架：移除步骤中专家识别并移除不良概念；重训练步骤中CBDebug将概念级反馈转换为样本级辅助标签，用于监督偏差缓解和针对性增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构（PIP-Net、Post-hoc CBM）和基准测试中显著优于先前的重训练方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效减少了模型对不良概念的依赖，提升了概念瓶颈模型的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉船是海上历史的重要标志，但通过人工检查测深数据来发现沉船耗时且需要专家分析，因此需要自动化工具来提高效率。

Method: 开发了一个基于深度学习的开源工具，包括数据预处理、深度学习推理、模型输出阈值处理，能够生成像素级分割掩码或边界框；使用来自五大湖和爱尔兰海岸的沉船数据进行训练，并采用合成数据生成来增加数据集规模和多样性。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder提供了一个有效的自动化沉船检测解决方案，其开源特性便于更广泛的应用和开发。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于幅度的剪枝如何影响神经网络的可解释性，发现轻中度剪枝能改善显著性图的聚焦度和忠实度，而过度剪枝会降低概念一致性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明神经网络可以大幅剪枝而保持性能，但剪枝对模型可解释性的影响尚不清楚。本研究旨在探索剪枝如何影响从低层显著性图到高层概念表示的可解释性。

Method: 使用在ImageNette上训练的ResNet-18，比较不同剪枝水平下Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients的事后解释，评估稀疏性和忠实度，并应用CRAFT方法进行概念提取以跟踪学习概念的语义一致性变化。

Result: 轻中度剪枝改善了显著性图的聚焦度和忠实度，同时保持了清晰、语义上有意义的概念；而过度剪枝虽然保持准确率，但合并了异质特征，降低了显著性图稀疏性和概念一致性。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以塑造内部表示使其更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会损害可解释性，需要在性能和可解释性之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖点云输入的局限性，因为大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，而视觉数据更为常见。

Method: 基于轻量级稀疏卷积骨干网络，使用两个专用头：一个用于3D物体检测，一个用于布局估计，采用新颖有效的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个挑战性场景理解基准测试中达到最先进性能：(i)使用真实点云，(ii)使用带位姿图像，(iii)使用无位姿图像。在布局估计方面显著进步，为整体室内场景理解设定了新基准。

Conclusion: TUN3D在无需真实相机位姿或深度监督的情况下，实现了联合布局估计和3D物体检测，推动了整体室内场景理解的发展。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视图像不同区域的重要性差异，可能损害视觉关键内容的重建质量。

Method: 将图像分割为关键和非关键区域，关键区域使用图像语义编码器处理，非关键区域采用图像到文本建模方法压缩，并应用模型量化和低秩自适应微调技术实现轻量级部署。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提系统在语义保真度和视觉质量方面均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在图像传输任务中表现出有效性，能够在提升资源利用率的同时保持性能。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Result: 实验证明该框架在鲁棒骨架化、形状压缩和增材制造刚度增强等任务中有效。

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间提供了一种理论严谨的层次形状简化方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Motivation: 现有气候预测空间分辨率低（12.5公里），限制了其在地方决策中的可用性，需要高分辨率的气候预测数据。

Method: 在观测网格数据集上训练单图像超分辨率模型，然后应用于低分辨率气候预测；提出基于气候指标的评估方法，使用气象站观测数据计算气候指数来评估降尺度结果。

Result: 实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型能够降尺度气候预测，且不会增加气候指标误差。

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型可以有效提高气候预测的空间分辨率，为地方决策提供更精细的气候数据。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于图像的越狱攻击的实际挑战，以及为视觉语言模型开发高效防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher

*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Dareen Alharthi,Seungone Kim,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的多模态大语言模型，通过生成器-评估器交互训练，在多个基准测试中优于更大的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE）无法捕捉人类判断的细微差别，而人工评估成本高昂；多模态大语言模型在视频理解评估方面的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用生成器-评估器交互训练方法：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃，训练出3B和7B规模的VideoJudge模型。

Result: 在四个元评估基准中的三个上，VideoJudge-7B优于更大的基线模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 32B和72B）；发现纯文本LLM评估器表现不如多模态LLM，长链思维推理无助于性能提升。

Conclusion: 视频输入对于视频理解任务的评估至关重要；VideoJudge证明了专门化多模态评估器的有效性，能以较小规模实现优于更大模型的性能。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom是一种用于多智能体协同感知的端到端特征压缩方法，通过瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化实现273-1365倍压缩，在6-30 bpp范围内保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知通过共享信息提升场景理解能力，但通信带宽限制了系统可扩展性，需要高效的压缩方法来减少传输负载。

Method: 采用端到端方法，先通过瓶颈网络压缩特征维度，然后使用多阶段残差向量量化(RVQ)，仅传输每像素的码本索引。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X数据集上，ReVQom实现273倍(30 bpp)到1365倍(6 bpp)压缩，在18 bpp时性能与原始特征相当或更好，在6-12 bpp时仍能保持可接受的性能。

Conclusion: ReVQom实现了高效准确的多智能体协同感知，为实际V2X部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

*Khaloud S. AlKhalifah,Malak Mashaabi,Hend Al-Khalifa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现当前文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特阿拉伯职业图像时存在严重的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，DALL-E V3表现最差，职业图像中男性比例高达96%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特阿拉伯职业图像时是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性。

Method: 使用中性提示词让ImageFX、DALL-E V3和Grok生成56种沙特职业的1,006张图像，由两名沙特标注员从五个维度评估，资深研究员仲裁分歧，共获得10,100个判断。

Result: 所有模型都显示强烈性别不平衡：ImageFX 85%男性、Grok 86.6%男性、DALL-E V3 96%男性，领导和技术角色中性别失衡最明显，且普遍存在服装、场景和活动方面的文化不准确性。

Conclusion: 当前模型反映了训练数据中的人类社会偏见，对沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别呈现有限，需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和文化敏感的评估框架。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理增强的多模态大语言模型预训练范式，用于统一的不当内容检测，通过三个针对性预训练任务解决短视频内容与原始预训练数据的分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为每种问题类型训练单独的小型分类模型，需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入三个预训练任务：Caption（增强视频细节感知）、VQA（加深问题定义理解）、Chain-of-Thought（增强推理能力）。

Result: 实验结果表明该预训练方法在零样本和监督微调设置下显著提升MLLM性能，并对未见问题展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该预训练范式有效解决了短视频不当内容检测中的分布差异和复杂问题定义挑战，具有良好泛化性能。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: 将GUI定位重构为交互式搜索任务，通过光标移动来定位UI元素，而不是直接预测坐标，解决了VLMs在高分辨率GUI图像中预测坐标不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI定位方法将问题建模为坐标预测任务，但VLMs在处理高分辨率、复杂布局的GUI图像时难以准确预测数值坐标，需要新的方法来解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出GUI-Cursor模型，将GUI定位重构为多步交互搜索任务：模型在每一步确定目标对象、评估光标与目标的空间关系，并根据移动历史将光标移近目标。使用基于轨迹的密集奖励函数进行多步在线强化学习训练。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的GUI-Cursor在ScreenSpot-v2上准确率从88.8%提升到93.9%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上从26.8%提升到56.5%，达到最先进水平。95%的实例在两步内解决问题，能自适应处理更复杂案例。

Conclusion: 交互式搜索方法比直接坐标预测更有效，GUI-Cursor通过视觉反馈和强化学习显著提高了GUI定位的准确性和鲁棒性，能够自适应处理不同难度的任务。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

TL;DR: 提出X-CoT框架，使用LLM的CoT推理替代基于嵌入模型的相似度排序，提高文本-视频检索的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统存在两个问题：低质量文本-视频数据对会影响检索效果但难以识别；余弦相似度无法解释排序结果，限制了可解释性。

Method: 在现有基准上增加视频注释以减少数据偏差，设计包含成对比较步骤的检索CoT，生成详细推理和完整排序。

Result: X-CoT在实证中提高了检索性能并产生详细推理依据，有助于模型行为和数据质量分析。

Conclusion: X-CoT框架通过可解释的推理过程改进了文本-视频检索，同时支持模型评估和数据检查。

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Motivation: 手术器械的安全性需要可靠的视觉缺陷检测，但人工检查容易出错，现有的基于自然/工业图像的自动检测方法在手术领域迁移效果不佳，存在误报、小缺陷检测不敏感和领域偏移问题。

Method: 整合背景掩码、基于补丁的分析策略和高效的领域自适应，专门针对手术器械调整无监督缺陷检测方法。

Result: 该方法克服了现有方法的局限性，能够在手术器械图像中可靠地检测细粒度缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过专门针对手术器械的适应性改进，实现了对手术器械图像中细粒度缺陷的可靠检测。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

Motivation: 现有基于表示对齐的方法依赖计算昂贵的大型预训练编码器，需要寻找更高效的训练策略来改进扩散模型的判别性特征表示。

Method: 提出LSEP正则化，将线性探测直接融入网络学习动态，促进中间层表示的线性可分性，无需外部编码器和表示对齐。

Result: 在256×256 ImageNet数据集上达到FID 1.46，显著提升了训练效率和生成质量。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了基于对齐的方法，无需外部编码器，同时提高了扩散模型的表示质量和生成性能。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法忽略了地理空间中的空间依赖性，无法有效处理假阴性（视觉和地理相似但被标记为负样本的图像对）和难负样本（视觉相似但地理距离远的图像对）问题。

Method: 提出空间正则化对比学习策略，整合半变异函数来建模空间相关性，将特征空间中的图像距离与地理距离关联，定义给定空间距离下的预期视觉差异作为参考来识别难负样本和假阴性。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上评估表明，显式建模空间先验能够提升图像地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度上的表现。

Conclusion: 通过整合空间统计工具半变异函数来建模空间相关性，能够有效解决对比学习在地理定位中的局限性，提升定位精度。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Motivation: 构建能够在单一统一架构中处理文本、语音和视频交互的数字人类代理，实现从静态肖像到持久智能视听交互的转变。

Method: 采用Thinker-Actor双变换器架构：Thinker模块基于预训练的大语言-语音模型感知和推理流式用户输入；Actor模块使用分块自回归扩散模型，通过交叉注意力将Thinker的隐藏状态转换为时间对齐的多模态响应。

Result: X-Streamer在两块A100 GPU上实时运行，能够从任意肖像维持数小时一致的视频聊天体验。

Conclusion: 该框架为实现交互式数字人类的统一世界建模开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

Motivation: 解决从单张图像预测物体运动的问题，克服现有视频生成器在物理场景中预测运动的局限性，因为像素生成的开销阻碍了直接的运动建模。

Method: 采用条件生成密集轨迹网格的模型，架构类似于现代视频生成器，但输出运动轨迹而非像素，从而直接捕捉场景范围内的动态和不确定性。

Result: 在模拟数据上广泛评估，在机器人等下游应用中有效，在真实世界直观物理数据集上显示出有前景的准确性，比先前的回归器和生成器产生更准确和多样化的预测。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹比生成像素更有效地预测物体运动，现有视频生成器即使在简单物理场景中也难以从单张图像预测运动，证明了该方法在运动预测任务上的优势。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

Motivation: 理解不同自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的性能差异，为基于任务需求和可靠性约束选择合适的特征提取方法提供经验指导。

Method: 在UCF Sports数据集上评估两种架构，通过分类准确率、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分度等多个维度分析特征质量。

Result: DINOv3在聚类性能（Silhouette得分：0.31 vs 0.21）和区分能力（6.16倍分离比）上表现更优，特别是在姿态可识别动作上；V-JEPA2在所有动作类型上表现更一致，性能方差显著更低（0.094 vs 0.288）。

Conclusion: DINOv3的空间处理架构擅长静态姿态识别但在运动依赖动作上性能下降，V-JEPA2的时间建模在不同动作类别间提供更平衡的表示质量，这些发现有助于理解视频分析系统中的架构设计选择。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Motivation: 传统灾害评估方法缓慢且危险，现有计算机视觉方法只能提供分类标签或分割掩码，无法提供全面的情境理解。

Method: 采用双架构方法：CNN-LSTM模型（基于ResNet50）处理卫星图像，Vision Transformer模型处理无人机图像，结合ConceptNet和WordNet的外部语义知识扩展词汇覆盖。

Conclusion: 双架构系统通过自动生成可操作、信息密集的描述，在提高灾害损害评估方面展现出重要潜力。

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于表征相似性度量的方法，用于分析不同视觉模型家族之间的表征差异和共性，发现几何结构和单元调谐具有家族特异性，而线性可解码信息则更广泛共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来识别哪些表征方面是跨家族共享的，哪些反映了独特的计算策略。

Method: 使用多种表征相似性度量（RSA、软匹配、线性预测性等），并通过相似性网络融合（SNF）方法整合这些互补的度量维度。

Result: 几何和调谐度量能强区分模型家族，而线性映射显示较弱分离。SNF融合后获得更清晰的家族分离，发现监督ResNets和ViTs形成不同簇，但所有自监督模型跨架构边界聚集。

Conclusion: 该生物学启发的框架为视觉模型提供了原则性分类法，表明由架构和训练目标共同塑造的新兴计算策略定义了超越表面设计类别的表征结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

*Yixiang Dai,Fan Jiang,Chiyu Wang,Mu Xu,Yonggang Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld是一个几何增强框架，通过向冻结的视频基础模型添加可训练的几何分支，在单次前向传播中联合建模视频潜在表示和隐式3D场，实现3D感知的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，限制了空间一致性和下游3D推理任务的实用性。需要将视频想象力与3D感知能力相结合。

Method: 引入跨分支监督机制，几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测，通过统一主干和跨分支信息交换实现联合建模。

Result: 在多个实验中，FantasyWorld在多视角一致性和风格一致性方面优于最近的几何一致性基线方法，有效桥接了视频想象和3D感知。

Conclusion: 该框架通过几何增强成功提升了视频模型的3D基础能力，几何分支的潜在表示可作为下游3D任务的通用表示，无需逐场景优化或微调。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理偏微分方程。它能处理不同维度、分辨率和物理场的异构时空数据，在多种下游预测任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决科学机器学习中处理异构时空数据的挑战，包括不同维度、分辨率和物理场的混合数据，需要一个灵活且强大的模型架构。

Method: 基于卷积视觉Transformer架构，结合组件卷积、场间交叉注意力和轴向注意力，使用预训练和微调策略，包括LoRA参数高效适配器。

Result: MORPH在零样本和全样本泛化中均优于从头训练的模型，匹配或超越了强基线和最新SOTA模型。

Conclusion: MORPH为学习科学观测的异构和多模态特性提供了灵活强大的基础，为可扩展和数据高效的科学机器学习指明了方向。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

TL;DR: 提出MS-YOLO模型，通过使用MobileNetV4替换YOLOv8的CSPDarknet骨干网络和引入SlideLoss损失函数，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本，适用于城市环境中的实时边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外成像在低光和恶劣天气条件下具有优势，但类别不平衡、热噪声和计算限制等挑战会显著影响模型性能。需要开发在保持高检测质量的同时最小化计算成本的解决方案。

Method: 基于YOLOv8，使用MobileNetV4替换CSPDarknet骨干网络以减少计算开销，并引入SlideLoss损失函数动态强调代表性不足和被遮挡的样本。

Result: 在FLIR ADAS V2基准测试中，MS-YOLO仅需6.7 GFLOPs计算量，实现了竞争性的mAP和优越的精度，计算开销减少1.5%。

Conclusion: MS-YOLO有效解决了在保持高检测质量的同时最小化计算成本的双重挑战，非常适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署。

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR是一种基于Transformer的多目标跟踪方法，通过显式预测目标运动来减少查询冲突，在DanceTrack、SportsMOT和BDD100k数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DETR-based多目标跟踪框架在单个Transformer解码器层中联合处理检测和跟踪查询，导致查询冲突和关联精度下降。

Method: 提出Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)，显式预测目标在帧间的运动，提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询冲突，实现更一致的训练。

Result: 在DanceTrack上HOTA提升超过9点，达到71.3（有补充数据）；在SportsMOT上HOTA为72.2；在BDD100k上mTETA为54.7，mHOTA为41.6，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 在端到端Transformer中显式建模运动是一种简单而高效的多目标跟踪方法。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

TL;DR: DeLiVR是一种高效的视频去雨方法，通过将时空李群微分偏置直接注入网络注意力分数中，实现几何一致的视频去雨。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外拍摄视频中的雨条纹、模糊和噪声问题，以及相机姿态微小变化导致的跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出两个互补组件：1) 旋转有界的李相对偏置，通过紧凑预测模块预测每帧的平面内角度，实现几何一致对齐；2) 微分群位移，计算相邻帧间的角度差异来估计速度，结合时间衰减和注意力掩码关注帧间关系。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 李群为视频建模中的空间和时间一致性提供了原则性表示方法，DeLiVR通过注入李群微分偏置实现了高效且鲁棒的视频去雨。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

Motivation: 受自然图像领域基础模型成功启发，希望将这种技术应用于SAR领域，利用自监督学习模型在有限标注数据下适应下游任务、对分布偏移更鲁棒、特征可迁移性强的优势。

Method: 首先测试现有视觉基础模型(DINOv2、DINOv3、PE-Core)在SAR任务中的表现，然后使用SAR数据对公开SSL模型进行自监督微调，训练AFRL-DINOv2模型。

Result: AFRL-DINOv2模型显著优于当前最佳SAR领域模型SARATR-X，成为新的SAR基础模型最先进技术。实验分析了不同骨干网络和下游任务适应方法的性能权衡。

Conclusion: 自监督微调是SAR基础模型发展的可行路径，虽然取得积极成果，但SAR基础模型建设仍有很长的路要走。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

TL;DR: UISim是一个基于图像的UI模拟器，通过两阶段方法从屏幕图像预测和合成新的UI状态，实现移动界面动态交互模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物理设备或静态截图分析，难以实现可扩展的UI测试和智能UI代理开发。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：给定初始屏幕图像和用户操作，先预测下一个UI状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: UISim在生成真实连贯的后续UI状态方面优于端到端UI生成基线方法。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型和合成数据生成提供实用价值，并为AI代理的UI导航任务规划铺平道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational
costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation
network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module,
LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million
parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for
resource-constrained environments. We validated our proposed model on DRIVE,
STARE, and CHASE_DB with outstanding performance in terms of dice scores of
83.28, 87.44, and 84.50% and Jaccard indices of 72.85, 79.31, and 74.70%,

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的新型群体情绪识别框架，通过多尺度场景编码和情感语义编码来增强群体情绪表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，并且忽视了情感标签语义信息对完整理解情绪的关键作用。

Method: 包含视觉上下文编码模块（利用多尺度场景信息多样化编码个体关系）和情感语义编码模块（使用群体情绪标签提示大语言模型生成细致情感词典，并通过结构化情感树精炼为全面语义表示），最后通过相似性感知交互对齐和整合视觉与语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛采用的GER数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的融合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的框架能有效提升群体情绪识别性能。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型直接应用于医学图像分割存在边界模糊、解剖关系建模不足和缺乏不确定性量化等挑战，需要专门针对医学图像特点的改进方案。

Method: KG-SAM包含三个核心组件：(1)医学知识图谱编码细粒度解剖关系；(2)基于能量的条件随机场确保解剖一致性预测；(3)不确定性感知融合模块提升临床可靠性。

Result: 在多中心医学数据集上的实验显示，KG-SAM在前列腺分割中达到82.69%的平均Dice分数，在腹部分割中MRI达到78.05%，CT达到79.68%。

Conclusion: KG-SAM被证明是一个稳健且可推广的医学图像分割框架，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

Motivation: 现有的大视觉模型需要跨模态和多源的任务特定预训练，成本高昂且难以扩展到未见任务。受预训练视频生成模型已捕获时序依赖的启发，探索能否将其适应到多样的图像和视频任务中。

Method: 提出UniVid框架，微调视频扩散变换器，将任务表示为视觉句子，其中上下文序列定义任务和期望输出模态。通过反转视觉句子顺序可轻松切换理解和生成任务。

Result: 尽管仅在自然视频数据上训练，UniVid在跨模态推理（图像和视频组合上下文）和跨源任务（自然到标注数据）上都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型有潜力作为可扩展的统一视觉建模基础，无需多源预训练即可泛化到多种任务和模态。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，兼容现代ViT的空间架构设计，在保持性能的同时实现加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT骨干网络采用空间架构设计（如窗口注意力、相对位置编码等），现有token缩减方法无法保持这些架构依赖的空间结构

Method: 使用2D缩减策略保持结构化token布局、空间感知合并算法维持相对位置、最大幅度维度token表示保留显著特征

Result: 在SAM-H上实现1.25倍加速且mIOU仅下降0.7%，在DeiT-B上实现1.15倍加速且准确率无损失

Conclusion: 该方法能有效保持空间架构的完整性，在各种视觉任务上实现state-of-the-art性能

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

Result: 在四种伪造类型上的实验表明，GASP-ICL超越了强基线方法，在不进行LVLM微调的情况下实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: GASP-ICL通过语义对齐的任务相关演示选择，增强了LVLMs在多模态深度伪造检测中的鲁棒性，提供了一种无需训练的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion

release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our

Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多图像推理方面存在两个关键挑战：缺乏跨图像推理能力和不足的跨图像参考奖励建模。

Method: 提出两阶段训练范式：结合标注轨迹的监督微调和图像感知强化学习优化；创新性地构建了集成对象级和图像级标注信息的轨迹数据方法；设计了具有对象和图像双重奖励函数的图像感知RL策略。

Result: 在多图像定位基准测试中达到最先进性能，跨图像推理任务上获得64.82%的准确率，比之前最佳方法提升1%。

Conclusion: MIRG-RL框架有效解决了多图像推理和定位问题，通过创新的数据构建方法和强化学习策略显著提升了跨图像推理能力。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Motivation: 当前视频生成方法在长期生成方面存在困难：扩散方法会出现时间不一致性和视觉漂移，自回归方法则会牺牲视觉细节。

Method: 采用动作引导的可变长度分块机制，基于机器人动作的语义上下文划分视频，并引入上下文感知的专家混合框架来保证视觉质量和块间过渡。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在扩展的rollout中实现了稳定一致的长期生成。

Conclusion: LongScape框架通过创新的分块和专家混合机制，有效解决了视频世界模型中长期生成的挑战。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 混合世界模型方法能够有效结合不同特征空间的优势，为具身规划研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹控制方法要么需要大量训练资源，要么专为U-Net设计，未能利用DiT的优越性能。

Method: 使用LLM将用户提示转换为前景和背景提示，分别指导视频中前景和背景区域的生成；提出STD-RoPE通过修改前景token的位置嵌入消除跨帧空间差异，增强轨迹控制。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视频质量和轨迹可控性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DiTraj为DiT提供了一种简单有效的无训练轨迹控制解决方案，显著提升了视频生成的可控性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Conclusion: 混合检索增强生成为多跳问答提供了实用的零样本解决方案，在准确性、效率和可解释性之间取得了平衡。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR新视角合成方法主要关注静态场景，但现实场景常包含动态元素如移动物体、变化光照等，需要同时建模时间辐射变化和3D转换。

Method: 基于高斯泼溅的HDR-4DGS架构，包含创新的动态色调映射模块，根据时间维度上辐射分布的变化动态调整色调映射函数。

Result: HDR-4DGS在定量性能和视觉保真度上都超越了现有最先进方法，实现了时间辐射一致性和空间准确的颜色转换。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从任意视角和时间点生成逼真的HDR渲染，解决了动态场景中HDR新视角合成的挑战。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Method: 提出几何感知隐式图像函数(GIIF)，通过联合优化隐式图像函数和显式3D手部形状，学习详细手部先验并上采样粗糙输入图像。

Result: 在InterHand2.6M和Goliath数据集上，SRHand在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有图像上采样和3D手部重建方法。

Conclusion: SRHand能够从低分辨率图像重建出包含皱纹、指甲等精细细节的3D手部几何和纹理图像，保持多视角和姿态一致性。

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像生成模型的普及引发了对其滥用的担忧，但当前检测方法主要依赖过时的低分辨率真实图像数据集，而现代摄影技术已发生根本性变化，需要重新定义"真实"图像的概念。

Method: 通过分析当前图像检测研究现状，指出其依赖ImageNet等老旧数据集的问题，并论证现代智能手机摄影技术使用神经网络处理图像，与生成图像技术具有相似性。

Result: 研究发现当前"虚假"图像检测方法存在根本性缺陷，因为它们基于过时的"真实"图像概念，而现代摄影技术本身已包含类似生成模型的算法处理。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考"真实"图像的技术定义，建立新的基准数据集，并质疑检测"虚假"图像这一目标本身是否合理。

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像美学评估方面具有潜力，但由于缺乏多模态美学推理数据和美学判断的主观性，难以生成准确且可解释的美学判断。

Method: 提出Aes-R1框架：1) AesCoT管道构建高质量链式思维美学推理数据；2) 相对-绝对策略优化(RAPO)算法联合优化绝对分数回归和相对排序，提升单图准确性和跨图偏好判断。

Result: 实验表明Aes-R1将骨干模型的平均PLCC/SRCC提升了47.9%/34.8%，超越了同类规模的最先进基线模型。消融研究验证了在有限监督和分布外场景下的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: Aes-R1使多模态大语言模型能够生成有依据的解释和可信的分数，在统一框架中增强了美学评分和推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出StableDub框架，通过唇部习惯感知建模和遮挡鲁棒合成解决视觉配音中的两个关键问题：音频驱动无法捕捉说话者特定唇部习惯，以及传统盲修复方法在处理遮挡时产生视觉伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉配音方法存在两个主要缺陷：(1)仅基于音频的驱动范式无法捕捉说话者特定的唇部习惯，导致生成的唇部运动与目标形象不符；(2)传统盲修复方法在处理遮挡物时经常产生视觉伪影，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于Stable-Diffusion骨干网络，开发了唇部习惯调制机制，联合建模音素音频-视觉同步和说话者特定的口面部动态。引入遮挡感知训练策略，在修复过程中显式暴露遮挡物。采用混合Mamba-Transformer架构优化训练效率。

Result: 实验结果表明StableDub在唇部习惯相似性和遮挡鲁棒性方面表现优异，在音频-唇部同步、视频质量和分辨率一致性方面超越其他方法。

Conclusion: StableDub消除了先前方法对成本密集型先验的需求，在计算密集的扩散模型骨干上展现出优越的训练效率，并从模型架构角度进一步优化训练效率，增强了在低资源研究场景中的适用性。

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

*Jibin Song,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony是一个音频到视频生成模型，通过运动感知损失和音频同步引导机制，实现了与音频精确同步的高质量视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频和图像到视频生成方法在控制运动时序方面存在局限，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，是时序控制视频生成的有前景条件。

Method: 基于预训练视频主干网络，引入两个关键组件：运动感知损失（强调高运动区域学习）和音频同步引导（使用视觉对齐的无音频层模型引导全模型）。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，Syncphony在同步精度和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Syncphony通过创新的同步机制，成功实现了音频驱动的时序精确视频生成，为音频到视频生成领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LG-CD模型，利用语言提示引导网络关注感兴趣区域，通过多模态信息提升遥感变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的方法主要关注单模态视觉信息，忽略了文本等多模态数据提供的丰富语义信息

Method: 使用视觉基础模型SAM2提取多尺度金字塔特征，采用多层适配器微调，设计文本融合注意力模块对齐视觉和文本信息，通过视觉-语义融合解码器深度整合信息

Result: 在LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD三个数据集上的实验表明，LG-CD持续优于最先进的变化检测方法

Conclusion: 该方法为利用多模态信息实现广义变化检测提供了新思路

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

Motivation: 现有文本驱动方法擅长纹理操作但缺乏精确空间控制，拖拽驱动方法主要修改形状结构但缺少细粒度纹理指导，需要结合两者优势实现更全面的图像编辑。

Method: 采用扩散模型框架，引入点云确定性拖拽增强潜在空间布局控制，以及拖拽-文本引导去噪在去噪过程中动态平衡两种条件的影响。

Conclusion: 建立了一个多功能且可泛化的可控图像操作解决方案，支持灵活的编辑模式，代码将公开以复现所有结果。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Motivation: 北欧地区无人机图像中的车辆检测面临强可见性挑战和雪覆盖引起的域偏移问题，虽然标注数据昂贵，但未标注数据通过无人机飞行更容易获取。

Method: 使用对比学习在未标注数据上预训练CNN特征提取器，然后将其侧载到冻结的YOLO11n主干网络中，通过大量实验比较不同的融合方法和粒度。

Result: 在NVD数据集上，提出的sideload-CL-adaptation模型在mAP50指标上提升了3.8%到9.5%的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用未标注数据改善了轻量级模型在具有挑战性的北欧雪域环境下的车辆检测能力。

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法需要特定模型的反转或大量优化，无法充分利用最新的图像转视频模型将图像编辑能力迁移到视频领域。

Method: 采用向量场校正与样本偏差避免反转，通过结构运动保持初始化生成运动感知的时序相关噪声，并使用偏差缓存机制减少计算开销。

Result: 评估显示该方法在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有方法，提供轻量级的即插即用解决方案。

Conclusion: IF-V2V方法成功实现了无需反转的高质量视频编辑，为视觉创意提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视角计数方法主要依赖全监督学习范式，需要大量标注数据。本文旨在通过自监督学习减轻对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 使用神经体积渲染学习场景的隐式表示，通过微分神经渲染重建连续几何形状和复杂视角相关的外观。该方法可以无缝集成到现有框架中。

Result: 在多个多视角计数基准测试中，SSLCounter不仅实现了最先进的性能，而且在仅使用70%训练数据的情况下仍能保持竞争性表现，展示了优越的数据效率。

Conclusion: SSLCounter通过自监督学习和神经体积渲染，有效解决了多视角计数中对大规模标注数据的依赖问题，具有出色的数据效率和性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前大多数基准测试强调定位精度而非模型是否真正理解场景中物体的排列和关系，这种差距影响了有效的场景理解能力。

Method: 使用受控合成数据集，评估了最先进的视觉模型和大型视觉语言模型在三个任务上的表现：空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务。

Result: 检测器如GroundingDINO和OWLv2提供精确边界框但关系推理有限，而视觉语言模型如SmolVLM和GPT-4o提供粗略布局线索但难以处理细粒度空间上下文。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了定位与真正空间理解之间的差距，并指出社区需要开发具有空间感知能力的基础模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过利用多个上下文图像对来缓解视觉上下文学习中的单对依赖问题，提高预测的稳定性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉上下文学习(VICL)通常过度依赖单个上下文图像对，导致预测存在偏差和不稳定性，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了基于补丁的k近邻视觉上下文学习(PANICL)，通过平滑多个上下文对的分配分数来减少偏差，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上（前景分割、目标检测、着色、多目标分割、关键点检测）相比基线方法都有显著提升，对领域偏移表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PANICL是一个通用且多功能的框架，能够有效提升VICL模型的性能，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

TL;DR: SingRef6D是一种轻量级6D姿态估计方法，仅需单张RGB图像作为参考，无需深度传感器或多视角图像，通过改进深度预测和深度感知匹配来处理透明、反光等挑战性表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法依赖深度传感器（对透明/反光表面效果差）或RGB方法（在低光/无纹理场景中匹配性能不足），需要一种无需深度传感器且能处理挑战性场景的轻量级解决方案。

Method: 1. 基于Depth-Anything v2提出token-scaler微调机制和新优化损失，改进深度预测；2. 在LoFTR中引入深度感知匹配过程，整合空间关系处理挑战性材质和光照条件。

Result: 在REAL275深度预测上比Depth-Anything v2提升14.41%（δ1.05指标）；在REAL275、ClearPose和Toyota-Light数据集上的姿态估计平均召回率比现有最佳方法提升6.1%。

Conclusion: SingRef6D提供了一种无需深度传感器、计算资源需求低的6D姿态估计解决方案，在挑战性表面和光照条件下表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet依赖与生成目标精确对齐的视觉条件，但在实践中对于不常见或想象性场景往往缺乏合适的视觉条件，而结构相似的常见场景条件又难以有效利用。

Method: 训练免费方法，首先使用与视觉条件对齐的替代提示进行辅助去噪过程提取注意力掩码，然后在目标提示去噪过程中利用这些掩码自适应调节视觉条件的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种视觉条件（深度图、边缘图、人体骨架）下都能在松散对齐条件下提升性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SemanticControl能够有效利用语义相关但未精确对齐的视觉条件，解决了ControlNet在实际应用中的局限性。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该工作为MLLMs的情感智能发展提供了基础评估框架，揭示了未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

Conclusion: MultiCrafter通过位置监督、专家混合架构和强化学习的结合，有效解决了多主体图像生成中的属性泄漏和偏好对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有开放世界部件分割方法的局限性：基于2D基础模型的间接监督无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致表面理解、不可控分解和泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，triplane-based双分支编码器生成空间结构化token；开发模型在环标注流程，从在线资源中整理超过500万3D形状-部件对。

Result: PartSAM在多个基准测试中大幅超越最先进方法，展现出新兴的开放世界能力：单次提示即可实现精确部件识别，并能自动分解形状为表面和内部结构。

Conclusion: PartSAM标志着向3D部件理解基础模型迈出的决定性一步，结合可扩展架构和多样化3D数据，实现了强大的开放世界部件分割能力。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无参考图像质量评估模型难以准确评估真实世界条件下的对比度失真，需要开发专门针对对比度质量评估的方法

Method: 定制化微调三种预训练架构（EfficientNet B0、ResNet18、MobileNetV2），添加对比度感知回归头，使用Siamese网络，在CID2013和CCID2014数据集上进行端到端训练

Result: 定制化EfficientNet B0模型在CCID2014上达到PLCC=0.9286和SRCC=0.9178，在CID2013上达到PLCC=0.9581和SRCC=0.9369，性能优于传统方法和其他深度基线

Conclusion: 对比度感知的轻量级预训练网络适配能够为无参考对比度质量评估提供高性能、可扩展的解决方案，适用于实时和资源受限应用

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

TL;DR: Geo-R1提出了一种面向少样本地理空间指代表达的推理中心强化微调范式，通过先生成显式推理链分解指代表达，再利用这些理性来定位目标对象，显著提升了在数据稀缺场景下的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 解决遥感图像中指代表达理解在数据稀缺场景下泛化能力差的问题，传统监督微调方法需要大量标注数据，但在实际应用中往往面临标注数据不足的挑战。

Method: 提出推理中心强化微调(RFT)范式Geo-R1，采用"先推理后行动"的策略：先生成可解释的推理链分解指代表达，然后基于这些推理结果定位目标对象。

Result: 在三个精心设计的少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1模型持续且显著优于监督微调基线，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过推理中心的强化微调方法，有效提升了少样本场景下的指代表达理解性能，增强了模型的泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at
http://geo-r1.github.io.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了视觉语言模型在医疗问答中的谄媚行为，提出了医疗谄媚基准数据集和VIPER缓解策略，发现模型存在独立于视觉证据的偏见机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在临床工作流程中应用日益广泛，但经常表现出谄媚行为，优先考虑与用户措辞、社交线索或感知权威的一致性，而非基于证据的推理。

Method: 构建医疗谄媚数据集，使用心理压力模板进行对抗实验，提出VIPER缓解策略——过滤非证据内容并生成基于证据的答案。

Result: 发现各种VLM模型普遍易受攻击，表现出显著的对抗响应变化，模仿和专家提供的纠正是最有效的触发因素。VIPER框架平均减少了谄媚行为，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该基准分析和缓解框架为医疗VLM在真实临床交互中的稳健部署奠定了基础，强调了基于证据的防御的必要性。

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

TL;DR: GLARIFY是一种利用时空注视信息增强视觉语言模型在现实应用中效果的新方法，通过处理模糊的注视模式来更好地对齐人类注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能眼镜的普及，用户注意力被整合到视觉语言模型中，但注视数据建模存在模糊性挑战：口头问题使用代词或跳过上下文变得模糊，人类注视模式嘈杂且与口语问题具有复杂的时空关系。

Method: 分析注视模态的查询样本，使用GPT-4o设计自动数据合成管道生成GLARIFY-Ambi数据集，包含专门的思维链过程处理嘈杂注视模式，设计热图模块将注视信息整合到先进视觉语言模型中。

Result: 在保留测试集上的实验表明，GLARIFY显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过稳健地将视觉语言模型与人类注意力对齐，GLARIFY为与视觉助手建立可用且直观的交互范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型存在空间偏见问题，当相同视觉信息出现在图像不同位置时会产生不一致输出。问题源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计，作者提出平衡位置分配方法来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其对空间变化的鲁棒性尚未得到充分理解。作者旨在系统研究LVLMs的空间偏见问题，揭示模型在不同位置处理相同视觉信息时的局限性。

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集分析LVLMs的空间偏见，发现问题源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计。提出平衡位置分配方法，为所有图像标记分配相同的位置嵌入，促进更平衡的视觉信息整合。

Result: 实验表明BaPA方法无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，结合轻量级微调还能进一步提升在多种多模态基准测试中的性能。信息流分析显示BaPA产生更平衡的注意力，实现更全面的视觉理解。

Conclusion: LVLMs存在显著的空间偏见问题，主要源于位置嵌入的不平衡设计。BaPA是一种简单有效的解决方案，能显著提升模型的空间鲁棒性和整体性能，为更平衡的多模态理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型主干网络已知编码了丰富的语义特征，但为了支持图像合成能力，它们也必须包含视觉特征。然而，由于缺乏标注数据集，分离这些视觉特征具有挑战性。

Method: 引入自动化管道构建具有标注语义和视觉对应关系的图像对，基于现有主题驱动图像生成数据集，并设计对比架构来分离两种特征类型。

Result: 经验结果显示，该方法在量化视觉不一致性方面优于CLIP、DINO和视觉语言模型等全局特征方法，同时能够实现不一致区域的空间定位。

Conclusion: 这是首个支持在主题驱动生成中量化和定位不一致性的方法，为该任务的进展提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型的嵌入作为通用表示表现出色，但在动态模态（如音频和视频）中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用分层特征融合策略和联合多模态多任务训练方法，实现任意模态间的跨模态检索和提示感知嵌入生成。

Conclusion: WAVE通过新引入的多功能视听学习基准，为跨模态任意到任意应用开辟了广阔可能性。

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,
audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion
strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two
key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of
prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies
validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across
all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual
learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any
applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时产生大量计算开销，而"图像思维"模型的出现使得推理可以扩展到视觉领域，这启发了粗到细的推理方法。

Method: 采用推理驱动的感知方法，利用多模态上下文确定关注区域，通过强化学习框架开发有效的奖励组件来处理感知不确定性，扩展裁剪区域以覆盖视觉模糊区域。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ERGO比原始模型和竞争方法获得更高准确率，同时效率更高。例如在V*基准测试中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B 4.7分，仅使用23%的视觉token，实现3倍推理加速。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知和粗到细处理策略，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的效率，为高分辨率图像处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

TL;DR: DualFocus是一个新颖的深度聚焦框架，通过联合建模空间和焦距维度的焦点变化，利用变分公式和双约束来提高复杂场景中的深度估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型深度聚焦方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，特别是在细纹理或深度突变区域，焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: 提出DualFocus框架，利用焦点堆栈中由焦点变化引起的独特梯度模式，引入具有空间约束和焦距约束的变分公式。空间约束利用不同焦点级别的梯度模式变化区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影，焦距约束强制单峰单调的焦点概率与物理焦点行为对齐。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，DualFocus在深度精度和感知质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DualFocus通过引入针对深度聚焦问题的双约束变分公式，显著提高了在挑战性区域中的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Motivation: 现有协作感知研究主要关注经验性的性能与通信量权衡，缺乏理论基础。需要建立理论框架来指导设计最优通信策略。

Method: 引入实用率失真理论，提出RDcomm框架：1）任务熵离散编码，为特征分配任务相关码字长度；2）互信息驱动消息选择，使用互信息神经估计实现无冗余传输。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和OPV2V数据集上，RDcomm在3D目标检测和BEV分割任务中达到最先进精度，同时通信量减少高达108倍。

Conclusion: 基于信息论的实用率失真理论为多智能体协作感知提供了理论基础，RDcomm框架通过任务熵编码和互信息选择实现了高效的性能-通信权衡。

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准测试在比较文本到图像模型方面提供了有价值的基础，但其被动设计诊断能力有限，难以揭示系统性失败的完整情况或隔离其根本原因。

Method: FailureAtlas将错误发现框架化为对最小化失败诱导概念的结构化搜索，虽然这是一个计算爆炸性问题，但通过新颖的加速技术使其变得可行。

Result: 应用于Stable Diffusion模型时，该方法发现了数十万个先前未知的错误切片（仅SD1.5就超过247,000个），并首次提供了大规模证据将这些失败与训练集中的数据稀缺联系起来。

Conclusion: 通过提供一个原则性和可扩展的深度模型审计引擎，FailureAtlas建立了一种新的、以诊断优先的方法论，指导开发更稳健的生成式AI。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的自监督幻觉缓解方法，通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间来放大幻觉信号，使用正负锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，有效减少多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但容易产生与视觉证据不一致的幻觉内容，现有方法通常需要额外微调或牺牲信息量和可扩展性。

Method: 引入幻觉放大机制：通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间作为负锚点，原始图像作为正锚点，利用双锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，拉近忠实语义表示，推离幻觉方向。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少对象、属性和关系层面的幻觉，例如使用LLaVA-v1.5-7B在CHAIR上实现超过5%的幻觉减少，同时保持召回率和描述丰富度，在不同架构上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工先验或额外训练成本，对无幻觉描述几乎无副作用，具有鲁棒性和即插即用的实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoFFT是一种无需训练的方法，通过模拟人类视觉认知来增强视觉语言模型的推理能力，包含多样样本生成、双重前瞻解码和视觉焦点调整三个阶段，在多个基准测试中实现3.1-5.8%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理复杂冗余的视觉输入时容易受到干扰，产生任务无关的推理过程甚至幻觉，这源于它们无法在推理过程中精确发现和处理所需区域。

Method: CoFFT包含三个迭代阶段：1) 多样样本生成：探索潜在推理路径；2) 双重前瞻解码：基于视觉焦点和推理进展评估样本；3) 视觉焦点调整：精确调整视觉焦点到对未来推理最有益的区域。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next等多个模型上的实证结果显示，CoFFT能带来3.1-5.8%的持续性能提升，且计算开销可控增加。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知的迭代推理过程，有效提升了视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，解决了复杂视觉输入中的干扰问题。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to
ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in
temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for
robotic planning. We present a lightweight agentic multimodal framework for
video-based scene understanding. Combining the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model
with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought
reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework
generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for
interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark
and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness
compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications
in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

Motivation: 面对面教学场景在计算机视觉领域尚未得到系统研究，主要原因是缺乏合适的数据集和有限的分析技术。

Method: 构建了包含语音内容、韵律、注视、身体动作和视觉上下文的多模态数据集，并对比了多模态大语言模型与传统任务特定模型的性能。

Result: 实验表明，多模态大语言模型即使没有任务特定的微调，也能超越专门的基线模型。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在理解面对面教学互动方面显示出巨大潜力，为全面理解教学互动提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

TL;DR: DAVIS是一个基于扩散模型的音频-视觉分离框架，通过生成学习方法解决音频-视觉声源分离任务，超越了传统基于掩码的回归方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将声音分离视为基于掩码的回归问题，但在捕捉复杂数据分布以高质量分离不同类别声音方面存在局限性。

Method: 利用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)和流匹配(FM)等生成建模范式，在专门的分离U-Net架构中，从噪声分布直接合成分离后的声音频谱图，同时以混合音频输入和视觉信息为条件。

Result: 在标准AVE和MUSIC数据集上的比较评估显示，DAVIS的两个变体(DDPM和Flow Matching)在分离质量上都超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成框架对于解决音频-视觉声源分离任务具有高效性，能够为不同声音类别产生高质量的分离结果。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Motivation: GAN和扩散模型生成的内容越来越逼真，现有方法仅关注空间或频域特征限制了泛化能力，需要同时利用局部细节和全局结构一致性来检测篡改

Method: 设计双域特征耦合器(DDFC)分解特征为局部空间分支和全局频谱分支，引入双傅里叶注意力(DFA)模块动态融合空间和频谱特征，基于改进的XceptionNet架构

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中达到最先进准确率，特别是在跨数据集和未见篡改场景下表现优异，同时保持实时可行性

Conclusion: 统一的空间-频谱学习对于鲁棒且可泛化的深度伪造检测非常有效，SpecXNet展示了双域方法的优势

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建模型无法生成材质属性，这在多样化光照环境中对真实渲染至关重要。需要能够产生PBR材质的自动化3D内容创建方法。

Method: 首先微调基于深度和法线图的多视角材质扩散模型，然后利用生成的多视角PBR图像探索高斯材质表示，该表示与2D高斯泼溅对齐并建模PBR材质的每个通道。

Result: 实验表明，该方法产生的材质在视觉上比基线方法更具吸引力，并增强了材质建模能力，实现了实用的下游渲染应用。

Conclusion: MGM框架成功生成了高质量的3D内容与PBR材质，支持动态重光照，为3D内容创建提供了更完整的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 提出的自监督点云补全方法有效克服了现有方法的局限性，通过多视图增强和Mamba架构实现了更好的补全质量

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Refine-Control框架有效解决了边缘设备部署条件图像生成模型的挑战，在资源效率和生成质量之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

Conclusion: MultiMat在多模态程序合成方面建立了新的最先进性能，能够更好地生成程序材质图。

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在DragGAN的潜在W+层引入PCA能显著减少优化时间，同时保持良好视觉质量，在浅层潜在空间（W+层=3）中甚至能提升SSIM指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制可能性。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Conclusion: MinerU2.5展示了强大的文档解析能力，通过解耦全局布局分析和局部内容识别，在计算效率和识别精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的开源框架，将2D开放词汇理解提升到3D高斯泼溅场景，解决了现有方法的三个关键缺陷：依赖逐场景重新训练、单语义设计限制以及跨视图语义不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流方法存在三个关键缺陷：(i)依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练，无法即插即用；(ii)限制性的单语义设计无法表示复杂的多概念语义；(iii)易受跨视图语义不一致影响，破坏最终语义表示。

Method: 利用预训练的2D分割模型生成并提升多粒度2D掩码到3D，为每个高斯点估计前景概率形成初始对象组，然后使用语义熵和几何不透明度优化模糊边界，最后通过视觉语言模型从最具代表性的视角提炼鲁棒的文本特征。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从数小时减少到几分钟，在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割基准任务中优于已建立的基于训练的框架，同时解决了它们的单语义限制。

Conclusion: MUSplat通过消除昂贵的逐场景训练过程，实现了高效、多语义的3D开放词汇理解，在性能和效率上都超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

*Jun He,Yi Lin,Zilong Huang,Jiacong Yin,Junyan Ye,Yuchuan Zhou,Weijia Li,Xiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UrbanFeel基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面的能力，包含14.3K个视觉问题，涵盖三个认知维度：静态场景感知、时间变化理解和主观环境感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市发展影响全球一半以上人口，但现有基准在探索MLLMs在城市环境中的表现方面有限，缺乏对时间演化和与人类感知一致的主观城市环境的系统探索。

Method: 收集全球11个代表性城市的多时间单视图和全景街景图像，通过空间聚类、基于规则的生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注的混合流程生成高质量问答对。

Result: 评估20个最先进的MLLMs，Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，准确率接近人类专家水平，平均差距仅1.5%。模型在基于场景理解的任务中表现良好，部分模型在像素级变化检测中甚至超过人类标注者，但在需要时间推理的任务中表现下降。

Conclusion: UrbanFeel基准填补了现有研究的空白，为评估MLLMs在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面的能力提供了系统性框架，揭示了模型在不同认知维度上的优势和局限。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

TL;DR: 提出EXCL方法解决无源无监督领域自适应问题，包含双专家框架和检索增强交互优化流程，在四个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFUDA方法要么仅利用源模型预测，要么微调大型多模态模型，但都忽略了互补洞察和目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: EXCL包含双专家框架（冻结源域模型+视觉语言模型）和检索增强交互优化流程（三阶段：协作检索样本、分别微调专家、强制学习一致性）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EXCL方法通过双专家协作和检索增强交互，有效解决了无源无监督领域自适应问题，取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑虽然质量出色，但存在计算延迟过高的问题，阻碍了实际应用，需要开发实时高效的编辑方法。

Method: 提出FlashEdit框架，包含三个关键技术：(1)单步反转编辑(OSIE)管道避免迭代过程；(2)背景保护(BG-Shield)技术选择性修改编辑区域；(3)稀疏空间交叉注意力(SSCA)机制防止语义泄漏。

Result: 实验表明FlashEdit在保持优异背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑时间低于0.2秒，相比之前的多步方法速度提升超过150倍。

Conclusion: FlashEdit成功实现了实时高质量的文本引导图像编辑，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Neural-MedBench基准测试，专门用于评估神经学领域的多模态临床推理能力，发现现有视觉语言模型在临床推理任务上表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准测试主要关注分类准确性，导致模型看似熟练但实际在高风险诊断推理中失败，需要专门评估临床推理能力的基准。

Method: 开发了包含多序列MRI扫描、结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记的紧凑基准，涵盖鉴别诊断、病灶识别和推理生成三个核心任务，采用混合评分流程结合LLM评分、临床医生验证和语义相似度指标。

Result: 对GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma等先进VLM进行系统评估，发现与传统数据集相比性能显著下降，错误分析显示推理失败而非感知错误是主要问题。

Conclusion: 提出了双轴评估框架：广度导向的大数据集用于统计泛化，深度导向的紧凑基准如Neural-MedBench用于推理保真度，强调需要更严格的临床AI评估方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的专用数据采集车辆和劳动密集型标注过程，而现有卫星方法存在数据遮挡、过时以及感知方法向量化效率低导致道路不连续等问题。

Method: 提出UniMapGen框架：1) 将车道线表示为离散序列，采用迭代策略生成更完整平滑的地图向量；2) 支持BEV、PV和文本提示等多模态输入；3) 开发状态更新策略确保全局连续性和一致性。

Conclusion: UniMapGen通过生成式方法和多模态输入有效解决了卫星数据局限性和传统感知方法向量化效率低的问题，为大规模地图构建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-2M是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的统一框架，能够从多视角图像同时进行网格重建和材质分解，特别擅长处理高反射表面，无需依赖外部模型先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将网格重建和材质分解作为独立任务处理，难以重建高反射表面，且往往需要外部模型先验来提升分解效果。

Method: 通过联合优化与渲染深度和法线质量相关的属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的粗糙度监督策略，结合精心设计的损失函数和优化过程。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上验证了方法的有效性，重建结果与最先进的表面重建方法相当，能够生成三角形网格及其关联的材质组件。

Conclusion: GS-2M提供了一个统一的解决方案，能够同时处理网格重建和材质分解，对高反射表面具有鲁棒性，且避免了复杂的神经组件，适合下游任务应用。

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: MesaTask框架能够有效生成物理合理且与任务描述对齐的桌面场景，为机器人操作任务训练提供了高质量的数据支持。

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习方法，在文档图像分类任务上进行实验，考察三种不同的分布外场景。

Result: 强化学习在分布外数据上表现出更好的泛化能力，包括分布外图像、未见类别和不同模态三种场景。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档图像分类任务中具有优势，特别是在处理分布外数据时表现出更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种针对文本到视频模型的黑盒越狱攻击方法，通过将有害叙述分解为多个看似无害的场景，利用场景组合约束生成空间，从而绕过安全机制生成有害视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到视频模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显。虽然已有研究探索了LLMs、VLMs和文本到图像模型的越狱攻击，但文本到视频模型的安全性尚未得到充分研究，存在显著的安全漏洞。

Method: 提出SceneSplit方法：1）将有害叙述分解为多个单独无害的场景；2）通过场景组合约束生成空间，使最终输出落入有害区域；3）结合迭代场景操作绕过安全过滤器；4）使用策略库复用成功攻击模式提高攻击效果。

Result: 在11个安全类别上评估SceneSplit，在Luma Ray2、Hailuo和Veo2模型上分别达到77.2%、84.1%和78.2%的平均攻击成功率，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前文本到视频模型的安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构的攻击，这项工作为理解和改进文本到视频模型的安全性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成图像时，特别是在使用较少采样步数或较低引导尺度时，输出结果往往不够真实且缺乏细节

Method: 基于动量的采样技术，利用当前预测与历史预测加权平均的差异来引导采样过程

Result: 在多种模型和架构下均能提升图像质量，使用SiT模型在ImageNet 256×256上仅用30步就达到1.61 FID的新SOTA

Conclusion: HiGS是一种即插即用的扩散采样增强方法，能够实现更快且保真度更高的图像生成

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决轻量级3D医学图像分割中存在的"效率/鲁棒性冲突"问题，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和异构模态时，轻量方法往往表现出脆弱的表示能力。

Method: 提出VeloxSeg框架：1）可部署可扩展的双流CNN-Transformer架构，包含配对窗口注意力(PWA)和Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理指导的卷积(JLC)；2）"一瞥-聚焦"原则，PWA快速检索多尺度信息，JLC以最少参数确保鲁棒的局部特征提取；3）模态交互的多尺度图像检索；4）通过Gram矩阵的空间解耦知识迁移(SDKT)注入自监督网络提取的纹理先验。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，VeloxSeg实现了26%的Dice系数提升，同时GPU吞吐量提高11倍，CPU吞吐量提高48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg通过创新的双流架构和知识迁移策略，成功解决了轻量级3D医学图像分割的效率-鲁棒性权衡问题，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

Motivation: 现有DiT加速方法要么使用统一启发式策略牺牲质量，要么需要高昂的微调成本，缺乏零更新基础模型的图像级自适应加速方案。

Method: 使用三个轻量级策略头（步长跳过、缓存重用、稀疏注意力）观察去噪状态并独立决策，通过GRPO在线训练策略参数，同时使用对抗性判别器增强奖励信号防止奖励攻击。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX等先进DiT骨干网络上，RAPID3实现了近3倍采样加速，同时保持竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: RAPID3证明了通过强化学习策略可以在不更新基础生成器的情况下实现高效的图像级自适应加速，为DiT的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The
source code of this paper will be released on

Motivation: 工程设计需要层次化的抽象和视觉理解与数学推理的结合，但现有MLLMs在从技术图表中提取数学模型方面的能力尚未被探索。

Method: 创建了包含8,006+个问题的综合基准，涵盖从组件级原理图到系统级框图的理解，并引入了层次化合成生成管道。

Result: 闭源模型在感知任务上准确率超过85%，但在符号推导和分析推理方面低于19%，揭示了视觉解析与符号推理之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 具有更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上表现更好，确认了数学理解在电路合成中的基础作用，符号推理是工程能力的关键指标。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Motivation: 遮挡是当前视觉模型在解释复杂密集真实世界图像和场景时面临的主要挑战，需要准确预测物体间的遮挡顺序关系。

Method: 使用预训练的GPT-4模型，通过专门设计的提示分析输入图像，生成遮挡顺序预测，然后解析响应构建遮挡矩阵。

Conclusion: 该方法能以零样本方式推理遮挡关系，无需标注训练数据，可轻松集成到遮挡处理框架中，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多焦点图像融合方法难以保持清晰的焦点-散焦边界，常导致模糊过渡和焦点细节丢失。

Method: 使用梯度域模型获得完整边界的初始融合结果，引入Tenengrad梯度检测提取显著特征，开发基于梯度和互补信息的焦点度量进行边界细化。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中持续优于12种最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效生成高质量融合边界，显著提升多焦点图像融合性能。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

TL;DR: 提出TDOA方法解决文本对抗攻击在动态输出场景中的局限性，通过聚类训练将动态输出转为静态单输出，采用最远标签目标攻击策略提高攻击效果，在多种模型和数据集上验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本对抗攻击方法主要针对静态场景，无法处理动态输出标签空间的问题，需要开发能适应动态输出场景的攻击方法。

Method: 使用基于聚类的替代模型训练方法将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，并提出最远标签目标攻击策略选择偏离模型粗粒度标签的对抗向量。

Result: 在4个数据集和8个受害者模型上验证，单次查询攻击成功率最高达50.81%，在静态场景中最高达82.68%，在生成式任务中超越先前结果0.64 RDBLEU和0.62 RDchrF。

Conclusion: TDOA方法能有效攻击动态输出场景，在有限访问条件下具有破坏大语言模型的潜力，同时在静态场景和生成式任务中也表现出色。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Result: 在海马体脑部MRI扫描分割任务上的实验表明，LTNs能够提升基线分割性能，特别是在训练数据稀缺的情况下效果更明显。

Conclusion: 尽管处于初步阶段，但神经符号方法具有足够的通用性，可以适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

Result: 在两个分布内和两个分布外数据集上，RAU始终优于SAM2微调基线，产生更准确的分割和更可靠的定位。其强大的泛化能力使其可扩展到分布外数据集。

Conclusion: RAU是首个探索VLM在医学图像中基于参考的解剖结构识别、定位和分割能力的方法，其优异性能凸显了VLM驱动方法在自动化临床工作流程中解剖理解的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测器由于从有限训练数据中学习到偏差，难以泛化到新的伪造类型。研究发现检测器过度依赖特定频带，导致频谱偏差。

Method: FreqDebias框架包含两个互补策略：1) Fo-Mixup增强动态多样化训练样本的频率特征；2) 双重一致性正则化，包括基于CAM的局部一致性和基于vMF分布的全局一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明FreqDebias显著增强了跨域泛化能力，在跨域和域内设置下均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FreqDebias通过缓解频谱偏差有效提升了深度伪造检测器的泛化性能，为处理未知伪造类型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用图像恢复中现有方法在未知混合退化条件下容易产生过度平滑、幻觉或语义漂移的问题，特别是在没有图像描述的情况下。

Method: 使用轻量级双分支调节器分别注入退化输入和轻度恢复代理的信号；设计时间步和层自适应调制策略；通过SigLIP特征实现无需描述的语义对齐；采用可扩展的数据筛选流程。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LucidFlux始终优于强大的开源和商业基线方法，消融研究验证了每个组件的必要性。

Conclusion: 对于大型扩散变换器，何时、何地以及如何调节——而不是增加参数或依赖文本提示——是实现鲁棒且无需描述的通用图像恢复的关键因素。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强多模态大语言模型可解释性的方法，通过多尺度解释聚合和激活排名相关性来改进视觉和文本模态的解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，但忽视了模态内依赖关系。视觉模态中孤立图像块归因忽略了空间上下文，文本模态中依赖前文标记引入了虚假激活。

Method: 提出MSEA方法聚合多尺度输入的归因来动态调整感受野，产生更整体的视觉解释；提出ARC方法通过top-k预测排名的对齐来测量上下文标记的相关性，抑制无关上下文的虚假激活。

Result: 在多个先进MLLM和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法一致优于现有可解释性方法，产生更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释。

Conclusion: 通过利用模态内交互可以显著增强多模态大语言模型的可解释性，为理解模型决策机制提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出U-MAN架构，通过渐进注意力引导特征融合和多尺度自适应KAN模块解决医学图像分割中细节丢失和边界模糊问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net架构存在两个主要限制：简单跳跃连接忽略了编码器-解码器之间的语义差距，以及缺乏深层多尺度特征提取能力，导致医学图像分割中难以保留细粒度细节和精确边界。

Method: 提出U-MAN架构，包含两个核心模块：渐进注意力引导特征融合(PAGF)模块替代简单跳跃连接，使用注意力机制融合编码器和解码器特征；多尺度自适应KAN(MAN)模块使网络能够自适应处理多尺度特征。

Result: 在BUSI、GLAS和CVC三个公开数据集上的实验表明，U-MAN优于最先进方法，特别是在定义准确边界和保留精细细节方面表现突出。

Conclusion: U-MAN通过结合注意力机制和多尺度自适应处理，有效解决了医学图像分割中的细节保留和边界精度问题，为复杂解剖结构和病理区域的分割提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

*Mishal Fatima,Shashank Agnihotri,Marius Bock,Kanchana Vaishnavi Gandikota,Kristof Van Laerhoven,Michael Moeller,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种任务特定的非线性量化方法γ-Quant，用于在低带宽和能量受限环境下进行模式识别，在仅使用4位量化数据的情况下，能在原始图像目标检测和可穿戴设备人体活动识别任务中达到与12位原始数据相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模式识别模型通常使用预处理数据，但这些预处理（如ISP图像处理、高精度ADC转换）主要是为人类感知设计的，在自动化分析场景下可能不是最优的，且在高比特数据传输时效率低下，严重影响可穿戴设备的电池寿命。

Method: 提出γ-Quant方法，针对低比特深度捕获的约束环境，学习任务特定的非线性量化策略，应用于原始图像目标检测和可穿戴传感器的人体活动识别任务。

Result: 实验表明，使用可学习量化的4位原始数据在性能上可以与12位原始数据相媲美，显著降低了数据传输需求。

Conclusion: 在低带宽和能量受限环境中，任务特定的非线性量化方法能够有效减少数据位深度，同时保持模式识别性能，为资源受限设备提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

*Zixian Zhao,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督的可见光-红外图像融合框架SSVIF，通过特征级融合分割与像素级融合分割之间的一致性，无需分割标签即可学习高级语义特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决应用导向的VIF方法需要下游任务标注数据的问题，传统方法只关注融合图像质量，而应用导向方法需要大量标注数据，数据获取成本高。

Method: 利用特征级融合分割与像素级融合分割的一致性，提出跨分割一致性自监督任务，设计两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了SSVIF的有效性，仅使用未标注的可见光-红外图像对训练，性能优于传统VIF方法，与有监督的分割导向方法相当。

Conclusion: SSVIF框架成功解决了应用导向VIF方法对标注数据的依赖问题，为可见光-红外图像融合提供了有效的自监督解决方案。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出Bézier Meets Diffusion框架，通过Bézier曲线风格迁移和条件扩散模型生成高质量标注图像，解决医学图像跨域分割问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像不同模态间存在较大域差距，现有基于GAN的风格迁移方法在高度可变区域难以捕捉跨域映射。

Method: 首先使用Bézier曲线风格迁移减少域差距，然后基于分割模型生成伪标签，训练条件扩散模型合成目标域图像，并开发不确定性引导的分数匹配方法提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法能生成逼真的标注图像，显著增强目标域数据并提升分割性能。

Conclusion: Bézier Meets Diffusion框架有效解决了医学图像跨域分割问题，通过风格迁移和扩散模型生成高质量数据，提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

### [139] [PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481)
*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PSTTS模块，通过空间令牌净化和时间令牌选择两阶段方法，有效识别并丢弃事件数据中的时空冗余令牌，在保持任务精度的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件帧序列的方法忽视了事件帧序列的高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致显著的计算开销。现有的RGB视频令牌稀疏化方法依赖不可靠的中间令牌表示且忽略事件噪声影响，无法直接应用于事件数据。

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：1) 空间令牌净化 - 通过评估每个事件帧内事件的时空一致性来丢弃噪声和非事件区域；2) 时间令牌选择 - 评估相邻事件帧之间的运动模式相似性，精确识别并移除冗余时间信息。该模块无需引入额外参数。

Result: 在HARDVS、DailyDVS-200和SeACT数据集上测试，PSTTS在DailyDVS-200数据集上减少FLOPs 29-43.6%，提升FPS 21.6-41.3%，同时保持任务精度。

Conclusion: PSTTS利用原始事件数据中的时空分布特性，有效识别和丢弃时空冗余令牌，实现了精度和效率之间的最佳平衡，是一个即插即用的高效模块。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GCPO方法，通过识别关键图像token（基于因果依赖、熵诱导空间结构和RLVR聚焦的token多样性）并进行动态token-wise优势权重优化，仅使用30%的token就能在AR视觉生成中取得比全token优化更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对所有图像token进行统一优化，但不同token对RLVR训练的贡献程度不同，需要识别AR生成中的关键token并进行有效的token-wise优化。

Method: GCPO从三个角度识别关键token：因果依赖、熵诱导空间结构和RLVR聚焦的token多样性，并为这些关键token引入动态token-wise优势权重来鼓励探索。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，GCPO仅使用30%的token就能在AR模型和统一多模态模型中取得比全token优化更好的性能。

Conclusion: GCPO通过有效识别和优化关键token，在AR视觉生成中实现了更高效的策略优化，证明了token-wise优化的重要性。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一个轻量级黑盒框架，用于解释多模态大语言模型中的自回归token生成，通过将生成的token归因于紧凑的感知区域，并量化语言先验和感知证据的相对影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉输入与自然语言输出的对齐方面表现出色，但生成的token对视觉模态的依赖程度仍不清楚，这限制了模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: EAGLE引入了一个统一充分性（洞察分数）和必要性（必要分数）的目标函数，通过贪心搜索在稀疏化图像区域上进行优化，实现忠实且高效的归因。

Result: 在开源MLLMs上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE在忠实性、定位性和幻觉诊断方面始终优于现有方法，同时显著减少GPU内存需求。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过提供细粒度的模型决策可解释性，有效提升了多模态大语言模型的可解释性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颜色是人类视觉感知的基本维度，随着视觉语言模型日益普及，了解它们是否像人类一样命名颜色对于有效的人机交互至关重要。

Method: 使用957个颜色样本在五个代表性模型上复制经典颜色命名方法学，进行跨语言分析和消融研究。

Result: VLMs在经典研究的原型颜色上准确率高，但在扩展的非原型颜色集上性能显著下降；识别出21个在所有模型中一致出现的颜色术语；发现语言模型架构显著影响颜色命名，独立于视觉处理能力。

Conclusion: VLMs的颜色命名能力存在局限性，特别是在非原型颜色和跨语言场景中，语言模型架构对颜色命名有重要影响，这为人机交互设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

TL;DR: HyCoVAD是一个混合SSL-LLM模型，结合自监督学习和大型语言模型来检测复杂视频异常，在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%并减少LLM计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂视频异常检测的挑战，这类异常由多个实体间的复杂关系和时序依赖定义，而非孤立动作。现有SSL方法难以理解交互语义，而LLM虽然推理能力强但计算成本高且缺乏细粒度空间定位。

Method: 提出HyCoVAD混合模型：1）多任务SSL时序分析器基于nnFormer骨干网络，通过多个代理任务识别可疑异常帧；2）LLM验证器对选中的帧应用结构化、基于规则的推理来验证异常存在。

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上，HyCoVAD达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%，同时减少了LLM计算量。

Conclusion: HyCoVAD成功结合了SSL的低级时空模式建模能力和LLM的语义上下文推理能力，为复杂视频异常检测提供了有效解决方案，并发布了交互异常分类法、自适应阈值协议和代码。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

TL;DR: JanusVLN提出了一个新颖的视觉语言导航框架，采用双隐式神经记忆来建模空间几何和视觉语义记忆，解决了现有方法的空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀问题，实现了最先进的导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多模态大语言模型的VLN方法依赖显式语义记忆（如文本认知地图或历史视觉帧），存在空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀等问题，阻碍了高效导航。受人类导航中隐式场景表示的启发，提出了双隐式神经记忆框架。

Method: JanusVLN框架包含双隐式神经记忆：空间几何记忆和视觉语义记忆。首先扩展MLLM以融入空间几何编码器的3D先验知识，增强仅基于RGB输入的空间推理能力。然后构建空间几何和视觉语义编码器的历史键值缓存作为双隐式记忆，仅保留初始和滑动窗口中的token的KVs，避免冗余计算，实现高效增量更新。

Result: 广泛实验表明，JanusVLN在超过20种最新方法中实现SOTA性能。与使用多种数据类型输入的方法相比，成功率提高10.5-35.5；与使用更多RGB训练数据的方法相比，成功率提高3.6-10.8。

Conclusion: 提出的双隐式神经记忆作为一种新范式，为未来VLN研究探索了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB

### [147] [SpikeMatch: Semi-Supervised Learning with Temporal Dynamics of Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22581)
*Jini Yang,Beomseok Oh,Seungryong Kim,Sunok Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeMatch是首个用于脉冲神经网络的半监督学习框架，利用SNN的时间动态特性通过协同训练生成多样化伪标签，在有限标签下有效提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络具有生物合理性和能效优势，但其半监督学习方法相比人工神经网络仍待探索，需要开发专门针对SNN特性的SSL框架。

Method: 利用SNN泄漏因子的时间动态特性，在协同训练框架中通过单个SNN的多个预测一致性生成可靠伪标签，用弱增强无标签样本训练强增强样本。

Result: 实验表明SpikeMatch在多个标准基准测试中优于现有适配到SNN骨干网络的SSL方法。

Conclusion: SpikeMatch成功证明了利用SNN时间动态特性进行半监督学习的有效性，为SNN的SSL研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

### [148] [Vision-Language Alignment from Compressed Image Representations using 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22615)
*Yasmine Omri,Connor Ding,Tsachy Weissman,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索使用2D高斯泼溅(2DGS)作为替代RGB的视觉表示，开发了高效的2DGS流水线，并将其适配到CLIP训练中，实现了有意义的零样本性能，同时将输入压缩3-20倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前视觉语言管道的两个结构性问题：(i)从边缘设备传输密集RGB图像能耗高、成本大；(ii)基于补丁的标记化导致序列长度爆炸，给注意力预算和上下文限制带来压力。

Method: 开发可扩展的2DGS流水线，包括结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和批处理CUDA内核；通过轻量级泼溅感知输入主干和感知器重采样器，将对比语言图像预训练(CLIP)适配到2DGS表示。

Result: 实现了超过90倍的拟合加速和约97%的GPU利用率；在DataComp子集上，GS编码器在将输入压缩3-20倍的同时，获得了有意义的零样本ImageNet-1K性能。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基底，虽然当前精度落后于RGB编码器，但为开发既语义强大又传输高效的表征开辟了路径。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongLive是一个用于实时交互式长视频生成的帧级自回归框架，通过KV重缓存、流式长调优和帧级注意力汇聚等关键技术，在保持高质量的同时实现高效的长视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频生成在效率和交互性方面的挑战：扩散模型效率低，因果注意力模型在长视频上质量下降，同时需要支持实时交互式提示输入以增强用户体验。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制处理提示切换，流式长调优实现长视频训练，短窗口注意力配合帧级注意力汇聚保持长程一致性。

Result: 仅用32GPU天将13亿参数短片段模型微调至分钟级生成，在单H100 GPU上达到20.7FPS，支持240秒长视频，INT8量化推理仅轻微质量损失。

Conclusion: LongLive成功解决了长视频生成的效率、质量和交互性挑战，为实时动态内容创作提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

*Ziyu Liu,Yuhang Zang,Shengyuan Ding,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Haodong Duan,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK是一个协同策略与奖励共同进化的框架，通过回收利用RLVR中被丢弃的rollouts和正确性数据，同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，无需单独奖励模型和昂贵的人类偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF成本高昂和奖励-策略不匹配问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信息的问题，通过回收利用训练过程中的有价值信息来提升效率。

Method: 在RLVR基础上，回收rollouts和正确性数据，使用点对点奖励评分、成对比较和基于反思响应的评估等混合目标，同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型。

Result: SPARK在多个LLM和LVLM模型上取得显著性能提升，SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，8个通用基准上提升1.5%。

Conclusion: SPARK框架通过协同进化循环实现了高效、稳定和可扩展的强化学习训练，无需外部奖励模型和相关成本。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

*Alexandre Lopes,Roberto Souza,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CCNeXt架构，一种自监督卷积方法，在深度估计任务中优于现有CNN和ViT模型，同时平衡计算成本，在KITTI数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和增强现实中至关重要，但受限于计算资源。立体图像对提供有效解决方案，但获取可靠地面真实深度数据困难，因此需要自监督技术。

Method: CCNeXt架构采用现代CNN特征提取器，在编码器中引入新颖的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，并全面重新设计深度估计解码器。

Result: 在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上达到竞争性指标，比当前最佳模型快10.18倍，在KITTI Eigen Split改进地面真实数据和Driving Stereo数据集的所有指标上均达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: CCNeXt在深度估计任务中实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

*Hongyu Chen,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT提出了一种基于统一建模语言的结构化推理框架，通过UML类图和活动图生成符号化的思维链和可执行动作计划，在杂乱房间清洁任务中优于非结构化CoT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中可解释性和可执行性受限。现有结构化CoT方法仅建模低阶关系，缺乏继承、行为抽象等构造，也没有标准化语义用于顺序或条件规划。

Method: 使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流。采用三阶段训练管道，结合监督微调和GRPO策略优化，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面优于非结构化CoT方法。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法，在具身推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot是首个用于计算机视觉的数据整理深度研究代理，通过多步骤推理执行三个核心功能：校准发现、可控合成和共识标注，有效解决大规模数据整理中的质量、多样性和成本平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决部署稳健视觉系统时高质量、领域特定数据集整理的瓶颈问题，平衡数据质量、多样性和成本之间的复杂权衡。

Method: 采用基于大型多模态语言模型的中央编排代理，通过多步骤推理执行三个核心工具：校准发现从大型存储库中获取相关数据，可控合成生成罕见场景的新数据，共识标注通过融合非极大值抑制和投票的共识机制协调多个基础模型产生准确标签。

Result: 在密集COCO数据集上，共识标注模块平均每张图像产生14.2个候选建议，是真实对象7.4个的近两倍，最终标注mAP达到37.1%。在Open Images数据集上发现903个新的边界框类别，总能力扩展至1500多个类别。校准发现在1000万样本规模测试中，主动学习策略比替代方案计算效率高40倍。

Conclusion: 具有优化、可扩展工具的代理工作流程为整理工业规模数据集提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

TL;DR: DIPSY是一种无需训练的少样本图像分类方法，利用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，通过正负图像条件控制和类相似性采样策略生成判别性合成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本图像分类中标记数据有限的问题，避免现有方法需要模型微调或外部信息源的限制。

Method: 使用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，引入扩展的无分类器引导方案实现正负图像条件独立控制，采用类相似性采样策略选择对比样本，构建无需模型微调的简单流程。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到最先进或可比性能，无需生成模型适应或外部工具支持。

Conclusion: 双图像提示与正负引导相结合能有效生成类判别特征，特别适用于细粒度分类任务。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HERMAN方法，利用LLM生成层次化文本描述符，增强CLIP在类增量学习中的语义空间，通过自适应路由匹配不同层次语义，缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP类增量学习方法使用简单模板（如"a photo of a [CLASS]"）忽略了视觉概念的层次性，且仅使用最后一层特征表示，忽视了早期层的层次信息。

Method: 利用LLM递归生成判别性文本描述符，增强语义空间的层次线索，将这些描述符匹配到不同语义层次，并根据任务需求自适应路由。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN方法通过层次化表示匹配有效提升了CLIP在类增量学习中的性能，缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文发现自回归视觉生成模型VAR在配备马尔可夫注意力掩码时，数学上等价于离散扩散模型，提出了SRDD框架，将扩散模型的优势引入VAR，实现了更快的收敛、更低的推理成本和更好的零样本重建性能。


<details>

Motivation: 重新审视VAR模型，发现其与离散扩散模型的理论等价性，旨在将扩散模型的优势（如迭代精炼）引入自回归变换器，提升效率和生成质量。

Method: 提出SRDD框架，通过马尔可夫注意力掩码建立VAR与离散扩散的数学等价关系，并基于此将扩散模型的迭代精炼等特性整合到VAR架构中。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，基于扩散视角的VAR在效率和生成质量方面均获得一致提升，实现了更快收敛、更低推理成本和改进的零样本重建。

Conclusion: 建立了自回归变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁，证明了将扩散模型优势引入VAR可以显著提升视觉生成任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward是首个细粒度、时空感知的基准数据集，用于标注人类感知的AI生成视频伪影，包含4.3K详细标注，训练的多模态奖励模型在伪影识别、定位和解释方面优于GPT-5 34.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视频生成模型快速发展，但人类能否检测生成视频中的深度伪造痕迹这一关键维度被忽视，需要建立能够识别时空视觉伪影的基准。

Method: 构建包含4.3K详细标注的数据集，每个标注包含自然语言解释、边界框区域和精确时间戳，将标注整合为9大类深度伪造痕迹，训练多模态语言模型作为奖励模型来模仿人类判断和定位。

Result: 7B奖励模型在伪影识别、定位和解释方面平均优于GPT-5 34.7%，观察到一致的难度梯度：二元分类最容易，细粒度检测较难，其中自然语言解释最容易，空间定位次之，时间标注最难。

Conclusion: 通过突出人类感知的深度伪造痕迹，DeeptraceReward为社会感知和可信视频生成提供了严格的测试平台和训练信号。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CapRL框架，使用强化学习与可验证奖励的方法来训练图像描述模型，通过让无视觉的语言模型基于描述回答问题来评估描述质量，避免了传统监督微调对人工标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的图像描述模型依赖监督微调，需要昂贵的人工标注数据，导致模型容易记忆特定答案，缺乏泛化能力和创造性。需要一种能克服这些限制的新训练范式。

Method: 提出Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL)框架，采用解耦的两阶段流程：LVLM生成描述，然后基于该描述让无视觉的LLM回答多项选择题，根据回答准确率获得客观奖励。

Result: 在CapRL-5M数据集上预训练后，在12个基准测试中取得显著提升。在Prism框架下，性能与Qwen2.5-VL-72B相当，比基线平均高出8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL是首个将RLVR应用于主观图像描述任务的研究，证明了通过基于效用的奖励设计可以显著提升图像描述模型的性能，为开放端任务提供了新的训练范式。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Motivation: 现有指代分割方法需要微调或多模型组合，而大规模生成扩散模型包含丰富语义信息，可作为通用特征提取器

Method: 利用扩散变换器的注意力分数，识别并处理停用词作为注意力磁铁，抑制全局注意力汇，提出注意力重分配策略

Result: 在零样本指代图像和视频分割基准测试中，始终优于先前方法

Conclusion: 扩散变换器的注意力特征可直接用于下游任务，无需额外训练或组件，为指代分割提供了简单有效的解决方案

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对象中心过程挖掘和随机过程分析的新方法，用于分析食品零售流程以减少食物浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过优化商店库存管理，在避免食物浪费（因供应过剩）和产品短缺之间找到平衡。

Method: 首先从杂货店销售数据中发现连续时间马尔可夫链形式的随机过程模型，然后扩展供应活动，最后进行假设分析评估产品数量随时间变化。

Result: 能够识别客户购买行为和供应策略之间的最优平衡点。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于预防因供应过剩导致的食物浪费和产品短缺问题。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

### [161] [Impact of Loss Weight and Model Complexity on Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21393)
*Yi En Chou,Te Hsin Liu,Chao An Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重方案来改进PINNs在PDE求解中的训练稳定性，其中第二种方案结合了可量化与不可量化项，在多个基准测试中表现优于等权重方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在求解偏微分方程时对损失权重选择高度敏感，需要更平衡的训练策略来提升稳定性和准确性。

Method: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重方案：第一种仅基于可量化项，第二种同时结合可量化与不可量化项，通过更平衡的损失权重分配来优化PINNs训练。

Result: 在热传导、对流扩散和顶盖驱动腔流等基准测试中，第二种方案相比等权重方法显著提高了稳定性和准确性，特别是在高Peclet数对流扩散问题中，传统求解器失效时PINNs仍能获得稳定准确预测。

Conclusion: 基于维度分析的权重方案增强了PINNs在计算流体动力学问题中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为解决传统方法难以处理的高Peclet数问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD
problems.

TL;DR: 评估LLMs作为实验设计代理的能力，发现它们对实验反馈不敏感，传统方法表现更好，提出LLMNN混合方法取得竞争性结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能够进行上下文实验设计，特别是在遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务中

Method: 使用开源和闭源指令调优的LLMs，比较传统方法如线性bandits和高斯过程优化，提出LLMNN混合方法

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，传统方法始终优于LLM代理，LLMNN方法在不同领域取得竞争性或更优性能

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在实践中无法进行上下文实验设计，需要混合框架将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取分离开

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NUFILT是一个无需数据的持续模型融合框架，通过零空间过滤和轻量级LoRA适配器实现透明度和保真度，在视觉和NLP基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据无关持续模型融合中如何在没有任务数据的情况下确保透明度（不干扰先前任务）和保真度（忠实适应新任务）的挑战。

Method: 提出零空间过滤方法，通过过滤新任务向量中与先前任务重叠的分量来确保透明度；使用轻量级LoRA适配器注入互补的任务特定信号来实现保真度；采用基于投影的替代损失训练适配器。

Result: 在视觉和NLP基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均准确率比OPCM和WUDI-Merging提高4-7%，减少遗忘并降低计算开销。

Conclusion: NUFILT通过联合过滤-适应过程有效吸收新知识同时保留现有行为，理论上有子空间对齐保证，实证表现优异。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

TL;DR: SeismoGPT是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于预测未来引力波探测器中的三分量地震波形，支持单站和阵列输入，通过自回归学习时空依赖关系来提供准确的地面运动短期预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为支持未来引力波探测器（如爱因斯坦望远镜）中的牛顿噪声抑制和实时观测控制，开发数据驱动的地震预测方法。

Method: 使用Transformer架构在自回归设置下训练模型，直接从波形数据中学习时空依赖关系，支持单站和阵列输入。

Result: 模型在即时预测窗口内表现良好，随着预测时间延长性能逐渐下降，符合自回归系统的预期行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的地震预测奠定了基础，有望支持引力波探测器的噪声抑制和实时控制。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

TL;DR: 使用具备推理能力的大语言模型在代理设置中为小型表格数据集生成决策树，替代传统的表格基础模型方法，提供可解释性并允许人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格基础模型虽然在小样本表格问题上表现优异，但模型变得难以解释且推理成本高。需要一种既能保持性能又具备可解释性的替代方案。

Method: 设计一组最小工具集用于构建、分析和操作决策树，让LLM结合先验知识和数据学习来创建轻量级决策树。

Result: 该方法生成的决策树在低资源表格问题上优于传统CART方法，虽然不如最先进的黑盒模型，但提供了可读的推理轨迹，并能检查偏见和数据泄露。

Conclusion: 基于推理的LLM决策树生成方法提供了可解释性和人工干预能力，允许纠正偏见和融入领域知识，是表格基础模型的有价值替代方案。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

Result: 在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上实现了幂等模型的最先进结果，推理速度比迭代分数模型更快。

Conclusion: SIGN方法成功地将扩散模型与幂等生成网络结合，实现了稳定训练、快速推理和灵活的采样策略。

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

TL;DR: 论文将生成模型中的幻觉定义为估计结果无法与任何合理原因关联的失败。研究表明，即使是损失最小化的最优估计器仍会产生幻觉，并给出了幻觉率的高概率下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义幻觉为损失最小化与人类可接受输出之间的结构性错配，挑战了传统认为幻觉仅源于模型错误的观点。

Method: 通过理论分析证明最优估计器仍会幻觉，并针对通用数据分布给出幻觉率的高概率下界，在硬币聚合、开放式问答和文本到图像生成任务中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验证实了理论预测，即使在最优估计情况下，幻觉仍然存在，支持了幻觉是结构性错配而非单纯估计误差的观点。

Conclusion: 幻觉应被重新理解为损失函数最小化与人类期望输出之间的校准错误，而非简单的模型缺陷。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Conclusion: d2框架仅使用强化学习（无需监督微调）就显著提升了扩散语言模型的推理能力，为扩散基推理提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Conclusion: 通过提供高质量基准和鲁棒模型，为数据不确定性下的海洋科学研究建立了坚实基础

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Conclusion: 共形数据增强是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著提升模型性能，同时提供理论保证的风险控制。

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Conclusion: FedZero算法提供了强大的理论保证，所开发的浓度工具不仅对高概率保证至关重要，也具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂储层系统的有效控制开辟了新机会。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

*Arani Roy,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlimDiff是一个无需梯度训练、基于激活信息的扩散模型结构压缩框架，通过谱近似方法动态修剪注意力和前馈网络维度，实现35%加速和约1亿参数减少，仅需500个校准样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成性能优秀，但计算开销巨大，现有效率技术依赖微调或重训练来恢复性能，存在瓶颈。

Method: 将扩散模型压缩重构为谱近似任务，利用去噪时间步的激活协方差定义低秩子空间，在固定压缩预算下指导动态修剪，对功能权重组进行模块化分解。

Result: 相比基线实现35%加速和约1亿参数减少，生成质量与未压缩模型相当，仅需500个校准样本（比先前方法少70倍以上）。

Conclusion: 这是第一个无需训练、基于激活信息的扩散模型结构压缩方法，提供了理论清晰性和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出基于评分标准的奖励机制来解决强化微调中的奖励过度优化问题，通过利用离策略示例来准确区分高质量响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化微调常出现奖励过度优化问题，模型会利用奖励信号的漏洞获得高分但生成低质量输出。理论分析表明关键在于高奖励区域的奖励规范不足，无法可靠区分优秀和良好响应。

Method: 研究基于评分标准的奖励机制，设计能够利用离策略示例同时对其伪影不敏感的评分标准。引入区分优秀且多样化响应的工作流程来获取高奖励区域的评分标准。

Result: 实证研究表明基于评分标准的奖励显著缓解了奖励过度优化问题，并实现了有效的LLM后训练改进。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的奖励机制是解决强化微调中奖励过度优化问题的有效方法，能够利用离策略示例准确评估响应质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

Motivation: 现有表示学习方法在平衡生成和判别任务方面存在挑战，MIM方法虽然能最大化输入与隐变量的互信息并促进编码聚类，但在判别任务上表现不足。

Method: cMIM在MIM基础上引入对比目标，施加全局判别结构，同时保留MIM的生成保真度。还提出了信息嵌入技术，从编码器-解码器模型中提取增强特征。

Result: 在视觉和分子基准测试中，cMIM在分类和回归任务上优于MIM和InfoNCE，同时保持竞争力的重建质量。

Conclusion: cMIM作为一个统一的表示学习框架，推进了同时有效服务于判别和生成应用的模型目标。

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

Method: 基于Kac结构引入速度空间的分类器自由引导，提出端点蒸馏方法训练学生模型匹配冻结教师模型在长区间上的表现。

Result: 实验证明DistillKac能够以极少的函数评估次数生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性优势。

Conclusion: DistillKac结合了有限速度传输的理论优势和有效的蒸馏策略，实现了快速且稳定的图像生成。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model

models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would

TL;DR: 提出一个名为Li₂的数学框架，用于分析两层非线性网络中的grokking现象，揭示了三个关键阶段：惰性学习、独立特征学习和交互特征学习，并通过梯度结构变化来解释特征涌现机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然grokking现象已被广泛研究，但仍缺乏一个数学框架来系统描述复杂结构化输入下特征如何涌现、何时涌现及其条件。

Method: 通过分析反向传播梯度GF的结构变化，将grokking过程分为三个阶段：GF随机时的惰性学习；GF携带标签信息且各节点独立学习时的独立特征学习；以及节点交互学习缺失特征的交互特征学习。

Result: 发现独立特征学习阶段遵循能量函数E的梯度上升，其局部最大值即为涌现特征；证明了隐藏节点如何交互以及GF如何聚焦于需要学习的新特征；揭示了权重衰减、学习率和样本大小等超参数的作用。

Conclusion: 该研究从梯度动力学第一原理揭示了grokking现象的本质，解释了现代优化器如Muon的有效性，并建立了记忆和泛化的可证明缩放规律，可扩展到多层架构。

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

TL;DR: TRiCo是一个新颖的三元博弈论协同训练框架，通过将教师、两个学生和一个对抗生成器整合到统一的训练范式中，重新思考半监督学习的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架的关键限制，如静态视图交互、不可靠的伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模等问题。

Method: 将SSL构建为三个角色之间的结构化交互：两个在冻结互补表示上训练的学生分类器、一个通过验证反馈自适应调节伪标签选择和损失平衡的元学习教师，以及一个扰动嵌入以揭示决策边界弱点的非参数生成器。伪标签基于互信息而非置信度选择，使用Stackelberg博弈形式化这种三元交互。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签机制下始终达到最先进的性能，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结视觉主干兼容。

Conclusion: TRiCo提供了一个原则性和可推广的解决方案，通过三元博弈论协同训练框架有效解决了现有SSL框架的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

<details>

Motivation: 当前主流的安全方法RLHF在训练时有效但推理时无法提供安全保障，LLM仍可能生成有害内容，需要推理时的安全保护机制。

Method: 将自回归生成建模为潜空间中的动态系统，通过后向可达性学习安全价值函数，包含运行时监控器和最小限制转向滤波器。

Result: 在多个LLM和毒性基准测试中，BRT-Align比基线方法更准确、更早地检测到不安全延续，显著减少有害生成同时保持句子多样性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 可达性分析为推理时LLM安全提供了原则性和实用的基础，能够产生更少暴力、粗俗、冒犯和政治偏见的内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare

the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety

Conclusion: 不仅证明了LLM拥有能够学习的归纳头，还提供了LLM如何在上下文中学习预测高阶重复模式的完整机制解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

Conclusion: LLMs确实展现出元认知能力，但这些能力有限且与人类不同，模型后训练可能在发展元认知能力中发挥作用。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

Conclusion: 本书系统性地构建了机器学习选择过程的统计理论基础，为理解和分析学习算法的性能提供了重要的数学工具。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

Conclusion: GDM扩展了可用状态动力学集合，能够更忠实地近似平滑和非平稳的真实动力学，在传统方法经常失败的随机时间序列多动力学场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

Abstract: In this digital era, online shopping is common practice in our daily lives.
Product reviews significantly influence consumer buying behavior and help
establish buyer trust. However, the prevalence of fraudulent reviews undermines
this trust by potentially misleading consumers and damaging the reputations of
the sellers. This research addresses this pressing issue by employing advanced
big data analytics and machine learning approaches on a substantial dataset of
Amazon product reviews. The primary objective is to detect and classify spam
reviews accurately so that it enhances the authenticity of the review. Using a
scalable big data framework, we efficiently process and analyze a large scale
of review data, extracting key features indicative of fraudulent behavior. Our
study illustrates the utility of various machine learning classifiers in
detecting spam reviews, with Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of
90.35%, thus contributing to a more trustworthy and transparent online shopping
environment.

Conclusion: GenUQ提供了一种有效的不确定性量化框架，特别适用于难以构建似然函数的随机算子问题。

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦持续学习面临灾难性遗忘的挑战，在分布式环境中由于数据异构性、通信受限和隐私问题而加剧。

Method: 将客户端更新投影到先前学习任务表示的垂直子空间，减少对早期任务的干扰；集成核心基向量预测任务身份并动态调整全局模型输出。

Result: 在标准FCL基准测试中显著优于最先进方法，在平均准确率上表现突出，特别是在任务身份未知的情况下。

Conclusion: FedProTIP通过梯度投影和任务身份预测有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Motivation: 现有因果抽象框架在考虑有损抽象函数时存在局限性，特别是当多个低层干预映射到相同高层干预时（抽象不变性条件），现有定义不够完善。

Method: 引入投影抽象的概念，从低层模型构建投影抽象，并将其应用于观测、干预和反事实因果查询的转换。提出了新的图形标准来从有限低层数据中识别和估计高层因果查询。

Result: 在实验上证明了投影抽象模型在高维图像设置中的有效性。

Conclusion: 投影抽象为处理有损表示的因果抽象提供了更通用的框架，能够更好地连接复杂低层因果模型与简单高层模型。

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANCE提出了一种低秩激活压缩框架，通过一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，显著减少内存和计算开销，支持设备上的持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备上学习需要高效学习，但现有激活压缩方法依赖重复的低秩分解，计算开销大，且未探索持续学习场景。

Method: 使用一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，避免重复分解，并将固定低秩子空间用于持续学习中的任务分配。

Result: 在多个数据集上减少激活存储达250倍，保持与完整反向传播相当的准确率；在持续学习基准测试中，以少量内存成本实现与正交梯度投影方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: LANCE是设备上高效微调和持续学习的实用可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种动态切换训练方法，在ViT-Large模型训练过程中从全参数训练切换到低秩适应(LoRA)，显著减少可训练参数和训练时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型训练资源消耗巨大，观察到大部分学习发生在训练早期阶段，权重变化在后期趋于稳定，可以用低秩矩阵捕捉

Method: 识别部分收敛状态，基于用户定义超参数确定切换点，为每个模块层分配特定秩，动态从全参数训练切换到LoRA

Result: 保持模型精度的同时，将可训练参数减少到原来的10%，吞吐量提升3倍，每轮平均训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少大型模型训练的资源需求，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接从深度学习模型预测分子Hessian矩阵的方法HIP，无需自动微分或有限差分，比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确、内存效率更高，且在多种下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但计算成本高昂且随系统规模扩展性差，无论是量子力学方法还是神经网络都存在这一问题。

Method: 利用图神经网络消息传递过程中计算得到的不可约表示特征（最高到l=2度），构建SE(3)-等变、对称的Hessian矩阵。

Result: HIP Hessians比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确、内存效率更高，训练更容易，系统规模扩展性更好。在过渡态搜索、几何优化加速、零点能校正和振动分析等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: HIP方法能够直接从深度学习模型高效预测Hessian矩阵，为计算化学中的关键任务提供了更优的解决方案，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BHRA方法，通过分块Hadamard调制解决PEFT方法中全局调制的局限性，在保持参数效率的同时实现局部秩放大，在多个推理任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA受限于名义秩，HiRA等扩展方法虽然提高了名义秩但将每个更新与冻结权重矩阵的全局能量模式耦合，ABBA则用完全学习的密集中间层替换这种归纳偏置。需要解决全局调制的局限性。

Method: 提出Block Hadamard高秩适应(BHRA)，将每个权重矩阵分区并在每个块内独立应用HiRA风格的乘法调制，保持PEFT参数足迹的同时解锁局部秩放大。

Result: 块状设计在不同秩预算下保持丰富频谱，缓解全局调制引起的崩溃。在8个常识推理任务和2个算术基准测试中，BHRA在匹配参数预算下始终优于强PEFT基线。

Conclusion: BHRA通过分块Hadamard调制有效解决了PEFT方法中全局调制的局限性，在保持参数效率的同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

Motivation: 尽管掩码预训练在语言、视觉和生物学领域取得了经验性成功，但其在数据表示学习中的作用和限制一直不明确。研究旨在从理论角度理解掩码预训练的行为机制。

Method: 使用高维最小范数线性回归理论框架直接表征掩码预训练行为，无需依赖额外模型规范。基于理论分析提出R²MAE方法，通过随机变化掩码比例强制模型捕获多尺度特征。

Conclusion: 掩码预训练行为可通过线性回归理论框架直接表征，R²MAE作为一种简单有效的预训练方案，能够通过多尺度特征学习超越固定掩码比例设置，在多个领域实现性能提升。

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为人工智能系统中的安全性、信任和AGI等概念提供严格的数学定义，并探索这些概念之间的基本关系。

Method: 提出数学定义：安全性指系统从不做出错误声明，信任指假设系统是安全的，AGI指AI系统始终匹配或超越人类能力。通过形式化证明展示这些概念之间的不兼容性。

Result: 证明对于严格定义的安全可信系统，存在人类可轻松解决但系统无法解决的任务实例。结果适用于程序验证、规划和图可达性等领域。

Conclusion: 安全可信的AI系统与AGI在数学上存在根本冲突，这一发现与哥德尔不完备定理和图灵停机问题不可判定性证明有相似之处。

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

Result: 在多个任务中，DriftLite相比纯引导和顺序蒙特卡洛基线方法，能持续降低方差并提高样本质量

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的推理时自适应提供了一条原则性、高效的路径

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

Conclusion: 尽管一般离散模型从纯观测数据中不可识别，但可以描述兼容参数和结构的完整集合，并在温和假设下建立了马尔可夫等价类的可识别性。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to
noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by
integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse
problems.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models
(LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and
systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a
zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought
(OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate
accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by

Motivation: 神经符号集成领域存在两种方法：将手工规则注入神经网络模型，以及从数据中归纳符号规则。需要一种统一框架来灵活集成数据驱动的规则学习和符号先验与专家知识。

Method: 扩展命题逻辑语法，引入具有可学习参数的选择操作符，从选项池中选择子公式。使用模糊逻辑将LoH公式编译为可微分计算图，通过反向传播学习最优选择。采用Goedel模糊逻辑和Goedel技巧实现无性能损失的离散化。

Conclusion: LoH框架统一了现有神经符号模型，支持任意程度的知识规范，并能无损离散化为硬布尔值函数，在保持性能的同时提供可解释性。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

### [204] [DIM: Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21666)
*Joshua Salim,Jordan Yu,Xilei Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法DIM，通过在深度神经网络中强制实施领域知识驱动的单调性约束来缓解过拟合问题，提高模型预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型由于复杂结构和大量参数容易过拟合，会记忆训练数据中的噪声而非学习泛化模式

Method: 通过惩罚相对于线性基线的单调性违规来强制单调性，建立线性参考、测量单调行为偏差，并将这些测量整合到训练目标中

Result: 在芝加哥网约车数据集和合成数据集上的实验表明，即使适度的单调性约束也能持续提升各种神经网络架构的性能

Conclusion: DIM通过应用领域知识驱动的单调性约束来正则化模型行为并减轻过拟合，从而提高了深度神经网络的预测性能

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

TL;DR: Neuroprobe是一个用于颅内脑电图(iEEG)的标准化解码任务套件，基于BrainTreebank数据集，旨在为脑机接口和神经基础模型提供严格的基准测试框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对颅内脑电图记录的标准评估框架，无法有效区分不同建模方法的优劣，阻碍了脑机接口和神经治疗领域的发展。

Method: 构建Neuroprobe解码任务套件，基于40小时来自10名受试者的iEEG数据，使用自然电影观看任务，通过测量特征在不同时间和电极位置的可解码性来研究语言处理。

Result: Neuroprobe能够可视化信息从颞上回流向前额叶皮层的过程，以及从简单听觉特征到复杂语言特征的进展。线性基线模型在许多任务中表现优于前沿基础模型。

Conclusion: Neuroprobe为iEEG基础模型提供了严格的比较框架，促进该领域的快速发展，代码和排行榜已公开。

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at
https://neuroprobe.dev/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlotFM是一个用于可穿戴加速度计的基础模型，通过时频槽注意力机制处理信号，在16个分类和回归任务中超越现有方法，平均性能提升4.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型主要关注日常活动分类，限制了在更广泛任务中的应用，需要开发能泛化到多样化下游任务的加速度计基础模型。

Method: 使用时频槽注意力机制处理原始信号的时频表示，生成多个小嵌入（槽），每个槽捕获不同信号成分。引入两个损失正则化器来捕捉局部结构和频率模式。

Result: 在16个分类和回归下游任务中，SlotFM在13个任务上优于现有自监督方法，其余任务与最佳方法表现相当，平均性能提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SlotFM展示了感知基础模型的强泛化能力，能够有效处理超出标准人类活动识别的多样化任务。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的K-means聚类问题表述，将其转化为子流形上的光滑无约束优化问题，并开发了二阶立方正则化黎曼牛顿算法，显著提高了收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: K-means聚类是困难的离散优化问题，现有松弛算法在平衡约束可行性和目标最优性方面存在困难，难以计算具有严格保证的二阶临界点。

Method: 将K-means问题重新表述为子流形上的光滑无约束优化，利用黎曼几何结构，提出二阶立方正则化黎曼牛顿算法，并通过流形分解使每个牛顿子问题能在线性时间内求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法比最先进的一阶非负低秩分解方法收敛速度快得多，同时保持相似的统计最优精度。

Conclusion: 通过黎曼优化方法成功解决了K-means聚类的离散优化挑战，实现了快速收敛和统计最优性的平衡。

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

TL;DR: Prophecy是一个自动推断前馈神经网络形式化属性的工具，通过提取基于神经元激活状态的规则作为前提条件来保证期望的输出属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于观察到前馈神经网络的大部分逻辑被内层神经元的激活状态所捕获，需要自动提取这些隐含的网络属性来支持形式化验证。

Method: 通过提取基于神经元激活状态（数值或开关状态）的规则作为前提条件，这些规则表示隐含在网络隐藏层中的属性，能够推导出期望的输出行为。

Result: 开发了Prophecy工具，展示了其在不同类型模型和输出属性上的应用，包括神经网络的形式化解释推断与证明、组合验证、运行时监控、修复等。

Conclusion: Prophecy在大型视觉语言模型时代具有重要潜力，能够有效提取和验证神经网络的形式化属性。

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpecMER是一种通过k-mer指导的推测解码框架，利用多序列比对中提取的k-mer基序整合生物、结构和功能先验知识，在保持推测解码效率的同时显著提高蛋白质序列生成的生物学合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在蛋白质工程中面临生成延迟问题，而现有的推测解码方法由于忽略蛋白质的结构和功能约束，导致生成序列生物学不合理且似然分布偏移。

Method: 使用从多序列比对中提取的k-mer基序作为生物先验，并行评分候选序列并选择最符合已知生物模式的序列，结合推测解码框架。

Result: SpecMER相比标准自回归解码实现了24-32%的加速，同时具有更高的接受率和改进的序列似然度。

Conclusion: SpecMER成功将生物约束整合到推测解码中，在保持效率的同时显著提升了生成蛋白质序列的生物学合理性。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种正交改进方法来提升仅使用PPG信号的心脏骤停预测系统：时间到事件建模、通过对抗训练消除患者身份特征的干扰、以及使用预训练辅助网络生成的伪标签进行回归预测。这些方法可将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生理基础模型如PPG-GPT虽然能预测心脏骤停等关键事件，但其强大表示能力在数据/标签稀缺的下游任务中尚未得到充分利用。需要利用最小辅助信息来改进仅使用PPG信号的心脏骤停系统。

Method: 1. 时间到事件建模：通过简单回归到事件发生时间或细粒度离散生存建模
2. 对抗训练：训练大规模去身份生物特征识别模型（p-vector），对抗性地消除可能导致过拟合的患者身份线索
3. 伪标签回归：使用预训练辅助网络生成的伪连续估计值作为目标，丰富心脏骤停波形标签

Result: 提出的方法可独立将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围。主要在较长时域上有所改进，事件附近性能下降最小，推动了早期预警系统研究。

Conclusion: 通过时间到事件建模、对抗性去身份特征学习和伪标签回归这三种正交方法，可以有效提升PPG-only心脏骤停预测系统的性能。同时使用PCGrad优化技术缓解多任务学习中竞争损失间的高梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

Method: 使用精确子图枚举与神经网络结合，并引入稀疏正则化来提升模型性能

Result: EIN相比标准图神经网络具有足够高的预测性能，并能通过选择的子图进行后验分析

Conclusion: EIN通过子图枚举和稀疏正则化的结合，在保持预测性能的同时实现了高可解释性

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性挑战全局模型性能，传统方法依赖全局训练后本地适应，需要早期质量控制。

Method: 从客户端原始数据提取代表性特征，应用聚类技术估计客户端间数据集相似性，基于相似性估计实现客户端选择策略，让每个客户端与数据分布兼容的其他客户端协作。

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习设置中具有可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Conclusion: 通过线性动力系统的语言连接不同算法，该框架不仅为并行化顺序模型提供了统一的理论基础，还指出了实现高效和可扩展计算的新机会。

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

Conclusion: 提出的信息论方法能够有效处理双层优化问题，通过统一的信息增益准则同时优化两个层级，在实验中表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 识别客观的神经影像生物标志物来预测阿尔茨海默病进展对于及时干预至关重要，但由于脑网络时空特性的复杂功能障碍常被现有方法忽视，这一任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用可解释的时空图神经网络框架，通过双随机微分方程建模不规则采样的纵向功能磁共振成像数据，学习稀疏的区域和连接重要性概率。

Result: 在两个独立队列（OASIS-3和ADNI）上验证有效，识别出海马旁回皮层、前额叶皮层和顶叶小叶等关键区域，以及腹侧注意、背侧注意和默认模式网络的显著中断，这些异常与纵向AD相关临床症状密切相关。

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

TL;DR: POLO是一个基于大语言模型的药物先导化合物优化框架，通过偏好引导的多轮优化策略，利用完整的优化轨迹而非孤立步骤进行学习，显著提高了样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物先导化合物优化方法样本效率低，难以在有限的评估次数内实现良好优化效果。现有基于大语言模型的方法未能充分利用其上下文学习和指令跟随能力。

Method: 提出POLO框架，核心是偏好引导策略优化算法，在轨迹级别和轮次级别进行双重学习：轨迹级别强化成功策略，轮次级别通过排序中间分子提供密集比较反馈。

Result: POLO在单属性任务上达到84%的平均成功率（比基线好2.3倍），在多属性任务上达到50%成功率，仅使用500次评估，显著提升了分子优化的样本效率。

Conclusion: POLO通过充分利用完整的优化轨迹和中间评估信息，实现了最先进的样本效率分子优化，为药物发现提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级BrainPoG模型，通过病理模式过滤和病理特征蒸馏实现高效脑图学习，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑图学习方法难以选择性学习疾病相关知识，导致参数和计算成本过高，限制了在真实临床场景中的实用性

Method: 1. 病理模式过滤器提取高度疾病相关的子图，实现图剪枝和病灶定位；2. 构建PathoGraph；3. 病理特征蒸馏模块减少疾病无关噪声特征，增强病理特征

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，BrainPoG在各种脑疾病检测任务中在模型性能和计算效率方面均表现出优越性

Conclusion: BrainPoG能够专门学习信息丰富的疾病相关知识，同时避免无关信息，实现高效的脑图学习

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

TL;DR: HyperCore是一个针对噪声环境的鲁棒自适应核心集选择框架，利用轻量级超球面模型和Youden's J统计量自动选择修剪阈值，无需超参数调整，在噪声和低数据情况下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法通常忽略标注错误且需要固定修剪比例，在实际应用中不实用。需要开发能够处理噪声环境且自适应的核心集选择方法。

Method: 使用每类学习的轻量级超球面模型，将类内样本嵌入到超球面中心附近，基于距离自然分离类外样本。利用Youden's J统计量自适应选择修剪阈值。

Result: 实验表明HyperCore在噪声和低数据情况下始终优于最先进的核心集选择方法，有效丢弃错误标注和模糊点。

Conclusion: HyperCore能够产生紧凑且信息丰富的子集，适用于可扩展和无噪声学习，解决了现有方法在噪声环境中的局限性。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding
compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free
learning.

TL;DR: SubZeroCore是一种无需训练的核集选择方法，通过结合子模覆盖度和密度的统一目标函数，在高剪枝率下优于需要训练的方法，并显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核集选择方法需要在整个数据集上计算昂贵的训练信号（如梯度、决策边界估计等），这与核集选择避免训练大量样本的初衷相悖。

Method: 提出SubZeroCore方法，将子模覆盖度和密度整合到单一目标函数中，基于闭式解的最优平衡采样策略，通过单个超参数控制局部密度测量的期望覆盖度。

Result: 无需训练的情况下，SubZeroCore与基于训练的方法表现相当，在高剪枝率下显著优于它们，同时大幅减少计算开销，对标签噪声具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SubZeroCore展示了在实际场景中的有效性和可扩展性，为核集选择提供了一种高效且鲁棒的训练无关解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

*Jaemin Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于神经场的4DVAR重新参数化方法，将时空状态表示为神经网络参数化的连续函数，实现并行时间优化，无需真实状态数据即可获得更稳定的初始条件估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4DVAR代价函数难以优化且计算密集，存在时间顺序依赖性问题，需要开发更高效、稳定的数据同化方法。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化连续时空状态函数，通过物理约束损失直接整合物理规律，实现参数空间中的并行时间优化。

Result: 在二维不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程测试中，相比基线4DVAR，该方法产生更稳定的初始条件估计，无伪振荡，且无需真实状态数据。

Conclusion: 神经场重新参数化方法为4DVAR提供了计算效率更高、实现更简单的替代方案，特别适用于参考信息有限的场景。

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

TL;DR: 使用fNIRS和机器学习检测多发性硬化症患者在执行手部灵巧任务时的大脑活动生物标志物，发现顶下小叶/角回和中央前回是重要脑区，脱氧血红蛋白比氧合血红蛋白更能区分患者与对照组。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症患者常报告手部灵巧性和认知疲劳问题，但损伤往往细微难以检测。研究旨在发现解释认知疲劳的大脑活动生物标志物，为未来脑刺激治疗提供靶点。

Method: 招募15名无手部、活动或认知障碍的多发性硬化症患者和12名匹配对照，执行单任务和双任务手部灵巧测试，使用fNIRS测量双侧前额叶和感觉运动皮层活动，应用机器学习分类器分析数据。

Result: K-近邻分类器在单任务中准确率达75.0%，双任务中达66.7%。通过可解释AI发现顶下小叶/角回和中央前回是最重要脑区，多发性硬化症组活动受抑制且神经血管反应较慢，脱氧血红蛋白比氧合血红蛋白预测效果更好。

Conclusion: 这种非传统的fNIRS数据分析方法揭示了新的大脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化脑刺激靶点。

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了有效信息准则(EIC)来评估符号回归发现的公式的结构合理性，通过检测数值不稳定性和噪声放大来识别不合理结构，提高公式的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅使用复杂度作为可解释性代理，忽略了公式的内部数学结构，导致发现的公式虽然形式紧凑但难以分析。物理公式通常在有限计算精度下数值稳定，这启发了EIC的提出。

Method: 将公式视为具有特定内部结构的信息处理系统，通过检测数据流经系统时的有效数字损失或舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构。将EIC与搜索式和生成式符号回归算法结合。

Result: EIC与搜索算法结合改善了Pareto前沿性能，减少了结果中的不合理结构；与生成算法结合使预训练样本需求减少2-4倍；与108位人类专家对公式可解释性偏好的吻合度达70.2%。

Conclusion: EIC通过测量公式中的不合理结构，实际上反映了公式的可解释性，为符号回归提供了一种评估结构合理性的有效标准。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在提升大语言模型推理能力方面表现出色，但其训练过程因需要为每个查询自回归生成多个响应而变得极其缓慢，生成阶段成为主要性能瓶颈。

Method: 采用并发感知的推测解码框架，根据实时并发水平动态调整草稿和验证策略；引入在线草稿学习机制，使草稿模型能够利用目标模型的反馈信号持续适应。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和模型上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了2.35倍到2.72倍的端到端加速，显著超越基线方法的效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的并发感知推测解码和在线草稿学习机制有效解决了GRPO训练中的性能瓶颈问题，大幅提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

Method: 使用DROZY数据集，提取ECG、EMG、EOG和EEG四种信号的特征，评估15种信号组合，采用决策树、随机森林、逻辑回归和XGBoost四种分类器。

Conclusion: 生理信号的特征级融合能提高疲劳监测系统的准确性、可解释性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as
transportation, healthcare, and performance monitoring. While most studies
focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships
between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY
dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal
combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination
achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as
a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal
ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological
signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of
fatigue monitoring systems.

Motivation: 传统混沌系统预测模型缺乏泛化能力，无法应对现实世界中零样本或少样本预测的需求，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下。

Method: 提出ChaosNexus基础模型，采用名为ScaleFormer的多尺度架构，并结合专家混合层，捕捉通用模式和系统特定行为。

Result: 在9000多个合成混沌系统测试中，长期吸引子统计保真度提升40%以上；在5天全球天气预报中实现低于1度的零样本平均误差，且可通过少样本微调进一步提升。

Conclusion: 科学基础模型的泛化能力源于训练系统的多样性而非数据量，这为类似模型提供了指导原则。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Motivation: 预测材料属性对于设计更好的电池、半导体和医疗设备至关重要，深度学习可以帮助科学家快速找到有前景的材料。公司投入大量资源扩展深度学习模型，需要了解如何通过扩展训练数据、模型规模和计算资源来优化性能。

Method: 训练了Transformer和EquiformerV2神经网络来预测材料属性，分析训练数据量、模型大小和计算资源三个超参数对性能的影响，发现了损失与超参数之间的幂律关系L = α·N^(-β)。

Result: 建立了经验性的缩放规律，可以预测增加训练数据、模型规模或计算资源对预测性能的影响，损失与相关超参数之间存在幂律关系。

Conclusion: 未来工作可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）在该领域的缩放规律，与当前训练的模型进行比较。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

Motivation: SAM方法被广泛用于寻找更平坦的极小值点以获得更好的泛化性能，但本文发现该方法可能收敛到不正确的极小值点。

Method: 通过理论证明幻觉极小值点的存在性，建立局部收敛条件，并提供实证证据，最后提出避免该问题的解决方案。

Result: 证明了SAM可能收敛到幻觉极小值点，这些点不是原始目标的真正极小值，并通过实验验证了这一现象。

Conclusion: SAM方法存在收敛到幻觉极小值点的风险，需要采取适当措施来避免这一问题，以确保找到真正的最优解。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

Motivation: 稀疏奖励环境中，标准MARL算法由于缺乏中间奖励反馈而难以有效指导策略学习，需要新的方法来应对这一挑战。

Method: 集成在线逆偏好学习和多智能体策略优化，使用基于偏好的价值分解网络产生全局和局部奖励信号，构建双优势流，并利用LLM提供偏好标签增强奖励模型质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了在线MARL中的稀疏奖励挑战，展示了在复杂多智能体环境中的实用价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

TL;DR: 本文首次对掩码离散扩散中的典型Euler采样器进行了严格分析，提出了MATU方法，在消除有界分数假设的同时实现了近乎无ε的复杂度，显著超越了均匀离散扩散的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码离散扩散在文本生成中表现出强大性能，但其在高维设置下的理论复杂性尚未得到充分理解。现有分析主要关注均匀离散扩散，对掩码扩散的分析存在忽视常用Euler采样器、施加限制性有界分数假设等问题。

Method: 1) 证明Euler采样器可实现ε精度总变差；2) 提出MATU方法，利用每个token最多被解掩码一次的特性，实现无偏离散分数近似；3) 通过截断均匀化策略消除有界分数假设。

Result: Euler采样器达到ε精度需要Õ(d²ε^{-3/2})次离散分数评估；MATU方法实现了O(d ln d · (1-ε²))的复杂度，消除了ln(1/ε)因子，显著加速收敛。

Conclusion: 研究为掩码离散扩散提供了严格的理论基础，展示了其在文本生成中相对于均匀扩散的实际优势，并为分析基于掩码范式的扩散语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一个分析草图双线性形式的通用框架，基于几何复杂度推导统一边界，并应用于联邦学习和多臂老虎机算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一边界方法无法有效处理草图双线性形式，而这类形式在现代机器学习和随机算法中普遍存在。

Method: 使用泛型链式方法和处理集合对上的上确界新技术，分析涉及多个独立草图矩阵的双线性形式。

Result: 推导出偏差按√T缩放的统一边界，恢复Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理等已知结果，并扩展RIP型保证。

Conclusion: 该框架为草图双线性形式提供了统一的几何复杂度依赖分析，在联邦学习和老虎机算法中实现了更优的收敛和遗憾边界。

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

TL;DR: 提出Graph of Agents (GoA)框架，将长上下文建模问题形式化为压缩问题，通过动态构建输入相关的智能体协作结构来最大化信息理论压缩目标，显著提升文档问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统虽然能够处理超出LLM上下文窗口的长输入，但性能严重依赖手工设计的协作策略和提示工程，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 基于信息理论压缩目标，提出Graph of Agents框架，动态构建输入相关的智能体协作结构，无需重新训练或架构修改。

Result: 在六个文档问答基准测试中，GoA将检索增强生成的平均F1分数提升5.7%，比使用固定协作结构的多智能体基线提升16.35%。仅用2K上下文窗口就在LongBench上超越128K上下文窗口的Llama 3.1 8B。

Conclusion: GoA框架通过信息理论方法显著提高了长上下文建模的有效性，实现了上下文长度的戏剧性增加，为模型无关的长上下文处理提供了原则性解决方案。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

Motivation: 现有分子基础模型主要依赖SMILES表示，忽略了实验光谱和3D结构信息，这在需要立体化学、空间构象和实验验证的任务中效果有限。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B预训练，明确建模分子光谱，统一实验光谱与分子3D结构。

Result: 在光谱相关任务上达到最先进性能，NMR、IR和MS基准测试平均准确率0.53；光谱分析任务中，Spectra-to-SMILES序列准确率15.5%，token准确率41.7%；能够从SMILES或光谱输入直接生成准确的3D分子结构。

Conclusion: MolSpectLLM不仅在各种分子解析任务上表现优异，还实现了从SMILES或光谱直接生成3D分子结构，连接了光谱分析、分子解析和分子设计。

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular
elucidation, and molecular design.

Motivation: 随着LLM上下文窗口增大到128K token以上，直接提供完整文档上下文成为RAG的替代方案，但这种方法存在token效率低、"迷失在中间"现象加剧、模型容量有限时干扰增强等问题。

Method: 提出LDAR（学习感知干扰的检索），这是一种自适应检索器，学习以减轻干扰性段落影响的方式检索上下文。

Result: 在多种LLM架构和六个知识密集型基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法强调了在信息覆盖和干扰之间平衡权衡的重要性，LDAR在减少token使用的同时实现了显著更高的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

Motivation: 解决单独使用ILP需要指定背景知识且计算成本高，或单独使用MLLMs存在感知幻觉的问题，实现从少量非结构化文本或视觉输入中发现逻辑事实和归纳逻辑规则。

Method: 利用MLLMs提出结构正确的规则建议，基于这些建议自动构建ILP任务并缩减搜索空间，然后使用ILP系统基于修正的逻辑事实和形式归纳推理输出规则。

Result: 在具有挑战性的逻辑归纳基准测试中验证了有效性，并在文本到图像定制生成等应用中展示了潜力。

Conclusion: ILP-CoT成功融合了ILP和MLLMs的优势，为逻辑规则归纳提供了一种有效的解决方案，在多个应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zubov-Net是一个自适应稳定学习框架，通过将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引区域与规定吸引区域之间的一致性表征，解决了神经网络ODE中鲁棒性与准确性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经ODE由于其动力学系统特性在输入扰动下具有内在鲁棒性，但现有方法需要施加Lyapunov稳定性条件来提供形式化鲁棒性保证。然而，施加适当稳定性条件困难导致鲁棒性与准确性之间存在张力。

Method: 提出Zubov-Net框架：1）将Zubov方程重新表述为RoAs与PRoAs的一致性表征；2）通过直接优化PRoAs来主动控制RoAs几何形状；3）使用三方损失（一致性、分类和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法；4）设计基于输入注意力的凸神经网络。

Result: Zubov-Net在保持高分类准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。理论证明最小化三方损失能保证PRoAs-RoAs一致对齐、轨迹稳定性和非重叠PRoAs。

Conclusion: Zubov-Net通过创新性地重新表述Zubov方程和主动控制RoAs几何形状，成功调和了神经ODE的准确性与鲁棒性，提供了理论保证和实验验证的有效框架。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 研究RLVR方法在实际应用中的真实效果，验证在严格对等评估下报告的增益是否可靠，以及RLVR是否真的无成本。

Result: 多个头条差距在清洁评估下缩小或消失，税感知协议能提供更可靠的推理增益估计，并在某些情况下修正先前结论。

Conclusion: RLVR具有价值且产业就绪，但需要保持其实际益处的同时优先考虑可靠性、安全性和测量标准。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using
Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight
matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to
describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

Method: 提出增量向量变换(IVT)，周期性将模型参数传送到保持与先前任务最优解线性连接的变换解，使用对角Fisher信息矩阵高效近似变换

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提升CIL基线性能，CIFAR-100上PASS基线最终准确率提升+5.12%，FGVCAircraft上SLCA基线平均准确率提升+14.93%

Conclusion: IVT是有效的即插即用框架，通过保持线性连接性来缓解灾难性遗忘，适用于无示例和有示例场景，与多种初始化策略兼容

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

Conclusion: 提出的离散指导匹配框架不仅包含现有方法作为特例，而且显著提高了采样效率，只需单次前向传播即可完成指导。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗保健中，机器学习模型需要可解释性。GAMs虽然可解释但忽略了高阶交互效应，CESR包含所有特征交互但性能不佳。

Method: 提出MACMs模型，在CESR基础上增加加法部分来解耦交互项和独立项的系数，扩展假设空间，同时保持形状函数的可视化能力。

Result: 基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和最先进的GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs在保持可解释性的同时有效提升了预测性能，是对CESR和GAMs的改进。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Conclusion: 实验验证了理论分析，表明随机生成过程在生成任务和分类等下游任务中表现符合理论预测。

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy
analytics.

Motivation: 理解为什么softmax在注意力机制中优于其他激活函数（如线性注意力），填补理论研究的空白。

Method: 使用统计物理学方法，在高维极限下分析基于注意力的预测器，通过少量序参量捕捉泛化性能。

Result: 在总体水平上，softmax达到贝叶斯风险，而线性注意力存在根本性不足；在有限样本情况下，softmax虽非贝叶斯最优，但始终优于线性注意力。

Conclusion: softmax在注意力机制中具有优越性，其特定属性是实现最优性能的关键，且与基于梯度的优化算法有密切联系。

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出SIHD框架，通过分析离线轨迹中的结构信息自适应构建扩散层次，在稀疏奖励的长时程环境中实现有效稳定的离线策略学习


<details>

Motivation: 现有分层扩散方法通常假设固定的两层扩散层次和单一预定义时间尺度，限制了在不同下游任务中的适应性和决策灵活性

Method: 分析离线轨迹中的结构信息来自适应构建扩散层次，量化状态社区的结构信息增益作为扩散层条件信号，引入结构熵正则化器减少对离线数据集的过度依赖

Result: 在具有挑战性的离线RL任务上显著优于最先进的基线方法，在决策性能和跨场景泛化方面表现出色

Conclusion: SIHD框架通过自适应层次构建和结构信息利用，在长时程稀疏奖励环境中实现了更有效和稳定的离线策略学习

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Active Attacks算法，通过自适应探索和周期性安全微调受害者LLM，有效生成多样化的攻击提示，显著提升攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法在生成多样化攻击提示时容易陷入局部最优，无法充分探索多模态分布，需要显式的多样性目标来捕获广泛的恶意行为。

Method: 基于主动学习范式，引入Active Attacks算法：周期性使用收集的攻击提示对受害者LLM进行安全微调，使已利用区域的奖励降低，迫使攻击者寻找新的漏洞，形成从易到难的探索课程。

Result: Active Attacks将对抗GFlowNets的跨攻击成功率从0.07%提升至31.28%（相对增益超过400倍），仅增加6%计算成本，优于PPO、REINFORCE等方法。

Conclusion: Active Attacks作为即插即用模块，通过自适应探索机制有效解决了RL方法在多样化攻击生成中的模式崩溃问题，显著提升了攻击覆盖范围和成功率。

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LALM模型缺乏细粒度机制来调节推理深度，导致对所有问题采用"一刀切"的推理深度，简单问题过度推理而复杂问题推理不足。

Method: 提出奖励函数，将推理长度与模型感知的问题难度动态关联，鼓励对简单任务使用简短推理，对复杂任务使用深入推理。

Result: 实验表明该方法既有效又高效，同时提升任务性能并显著减少平均推理长度。

Conclusion: 难度自适应推理方法能够智能地根据问题复杂度调整推理深度，为未来工作提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

TL;DR: GRAMDTI是一个多模态预训练框架，通过整合小分子和蛋白质的多模态信息来改进药物靶点相互作用预测，采用体积对比学习和自适应模态丢弃技术，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTI预测方法主要依赖SMILES-蛋白质对，未能充分利用小分子和蛋白质的丰富多模态信息，限制了预测性能。

Method: 提出GRAMDTI框架：1）整合分子和蛋白质的多模态输入；2）扩展体积对比学习到四个模态；3）引入自适应模态丢弃；4）结合IC50活性测量作为弱监督。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GRAMDTI始终优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督对于稳健和可泛化的DTI预测具有显著优势。

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了CFG在扩散模型中的采样动态，揭示了CFG通过三个阶段影响条件生成：方向偏移、模式分离和集中阶段，解释了为什么强指导会提高语义对齐但降低多样性，并提出了时间变化的指导调度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解CFG在扩散模型中对采样动态的影响，特别是对于多模态条件分布的情况，现有研究对此认识不足。

Method: 分析CFG在多模态条件下的采样过程，识别出三个连续阶段：方向偏移阶段、模式分离阶段和集中阶段，并通过实验验证理论预测。

Result: 实验证实早期强指导会削弱全局多样性，而后期强指导会抑制细粒度变化；提出的时间变化指导调度方法能同时提高质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CFG通过三个阶段影响采样动态，时间变化的指导调度是平衡语义对齐和多样性的有效方法。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

Method: 结合结构化目标规划器和目标条件动作剪枝器。目标规划器利用LLM生成可重用的结构化目标生成函数，动态生成前瞻性目标；动作剪枝器通过动作掩码机制过滤与当前目标不一致的动作。

Result: 在Crafter和Craftax-Classic环境上的实验结果表明，该方法相比现有最先进方法取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: SGRL方法通过结构化目标规划和目标条件动作剪枝，有效提升了强化学习在复杂环境中的探索效率和决策性能。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准稀疏自编码器发现的特征具有模糊性和无基础性，无法可靠地用于模型行为的主动因果探测。

Method: 引入Concept-SAE框架，采用新颖的混合解缠策略，通过双重监督方法生成语义基础的概念token。

Result: 双重监督方法产生的token具有显著忠实性和空间局部性，在解缠方面优于其他方法，支持直接干预和对抗性漏洞定位。

Conclusion: Concept-SAE为从相关性解释转向模型行为的机制性因果探测提供了验证蓝图。

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个仅对边进行增强的框架，通过重采样现有训练边来改善稀疏二分知识图谱的链接预测性能，避免引入虚假节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏二分知识图谱中数据不足和边稀疏导致的链接预测困难问题。

Method: 使用边重采样增强方法，包括均匀简单重采样和逆度偏置度感知重采样，保持原始节点集不变。在自然稀疏图和人工稀疏化基准数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens数据集上，基于复制的AEGIS变体与基线相当，而语义KNN增强是唯一能恢复AUC和校准的方法。在GDP图上，语义KNN获得最大的AUC改进和Brier分数降低。

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的数据高效策略，当有信息丰富的节点描述时，语义增强能提供额外提升。

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法主要针对视觉或语言任务设计，无法有效处理天气下游任务中的变量异质性、分辨率多样性和时空覆盖变化等独特挑战，导致在天气基础模型上表现不佳。

Method: WeatherPEFT包含两个创新：1) 前向传播中的任务自适应动态提示，通过内外模式提取动态注入嵌入权重；2) 反向传播中的随机Fisher引导自适应选择，利用Fisher信息识别关键参数并引入随机性稳定选择。

Result: 在三个下游任务上，WeatherPEFT使用更少的可训练参数实现了与全参数微调相当的性能，而现有PEFT方法存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT为天气基础模型提供了一个高效且有效的参数微调解决方案，解决了天气任务特有的挑战，同时保持了预训练知识的完整性。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

Result: 在数独问题上实现了99%的准确率，超越了之前的神经符号方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将模仿学习与搜索策略结合，为LLM解决NP类问题提供了新思路，并建立了与Min-Sum Set Cover问题的理论联系。

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了MCGM模块，通过多阶段聚类为几何图神经网络提供层次化全局上下文，解决了传统方法在建模长程相互作用时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何图神经网络在捕捉分子几何结构方面表现出色，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制难以有效建模长程相互作用。现有解决方案存在根本性限制：扩展截断半径会导致计算成本随距离立方增长；物理启发核函数通常系统特定且缺乏通用性；傅里叶空间方法需要仔细调参且增加计算开销。

Method: MCGM通过高效聚类操作构建原子簇的多分辨率层次结构，通过动态层次聚类提取全局信息，并通过学习变换将此上下文传播回原子特征，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。该模块可无缝集成到多种骨干架构中。

Result: 在四种不同骨干架构中集成MCGM后，OE62能量预测误差平均降低26.2%。在AQM数据集上，MCGM实现了最先进的精度（能量17.0 meV，力4.9 meV/Å），同时比Neural P3M少使用20%的参数。

Conclusion: MCGM是一个轻量级、即插即用的模块，能够有效增强几何图神经网络的全局建模能力，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升长程相互作用的建模精度。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made

Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收(专用特征捕获通用特征实例)和特征组合(独立特征合并为复合表示)问题，导致表示空洞和特征纠缠。

Method: 引入新的训练过程，通过惩罚SAE特征间的高余弦相似度来强制特征正交性，该方法计算复杂度与SAE规模呈线性关系。

Result: OrtSAE发现更多不同特征(+9%)，显著减少特征吸收(-65%)和组合(-15%)，在虚假相关性移除任务上性能提升6%，其他下游任务性能与传统SAE相当。

Conclusion: 正交约束能有效缓解SAE中的特征纠缠问题，提升特征解耦能力，同时保持计算效率，为神经网络激活的稀疏分解提供改进方案。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

Abstract: Latent space is one of the key concepts in generative AI, offering powerful
means for creative exploration through vector manipulation. However, diffusion
models like Stable Diffusion lack the intuitive latent vector control found in

Motivation: 针对点云降维中保持局部非凸性的需求，传统方法可能无法有效保留由绕行引起的局部几何结构。

Method: 构建k-NN图，识别欧几里得距离与最短路径比率低于阈值的可接受对，聚合归一化方向形成半正定非凸性结构矩阵，使用前k个特征向量进行投影。

Result: 提供了两种可验证保证：成对后验证书和平均情况谱界，评估协议报告固定和重选对的绕行误差及证书分位数。

Conclusion: CDP方法能够有效保持局部非凸性，并为实践者提供在数据上检查保证的能力。

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

TL;DR: MO-GRPO是GRPO的扩展，通过简单的归一化方法自动重新加权奖励函数，解决多目标设置中的奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在准确奖励模型可用时表现良好，但在许多现实任务中缺乏可靠奖励模型。特别是在多目标设置中，GRPO容易受到奖励黑客攻击，即仅优化一个目标而牺牲其他目标。

Method: 提出MO-GRPO，使用基于奖励值方差的归一化方法自动重新加权奖励函数，确保所有奖励函数对损失函数贡献均匀，同时保持偏好顺序。

Result: 在四个领域评估：多臂老虎机问题、模拟控制任务、WMT基准的机器翻译任务（英日、英中）、指令跟随任务。MO-GRPO通过均匀分布奖励组件间的相关性实现稳定学习，优于GRPO。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习问题中一个有前景的算法，无需手动调整奖励函数尺度。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on
the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO
achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the
components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising
algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

TL;DR: BrainPro是一个大型EEG基础模型，通过检索式空间学习模块和脑状态解耦模块，解决了现有模型在通道间交互和脑状态感知表示学习方面的不足，在多个BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型未能显式捕捉通道间和脑区间的交互信息，且由于不同数据集的电极配置差异，要么用自注意力近似空间结构，要么限制在有限通用通道上训练。此外，当前模型在自监督预训练中很少学习状态感知表示。

Method: 提出BrainPro模型，包含检索式空间学习模块来灵活捕捉不同电极布局下的通道和脑区级交互，以及脑状态解耦模块通过并行编码器和解耦损失、区域感知重建损失实现状态感知表示学习。

Result: 在大规模EEG语料库上预训练后，BrainPro在九个公共BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能和鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BrainPro通过创新的空间学习和状态解耦设计，能够无缝适应多样化任务和硬件设置，为EEG解码提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

TL;DR: 提出在教师模型训练中引入类内对比损失来丰富软标签中的类内信息，并通过融入边界损失解决训练不稳定和收敛慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法中，教师模型主要遵循真实标签作为目标，没有考虑同一类别内的多样性表示，导致软标签中的类内信息不足。

Method: 在教师训练阶段引入类内对比损失，并整合边界损失来改善训练稳定性和收敛速度。

Result: 理论分析证明类内对比损失能够丰富类内多样性，实验结果表明所提方法有效。

Conclusion: 通过类内对比损失和边界损失的结合，能够有效提升知识蒸馏中软标签的类内信息质量。

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数迁移是迁移学习的核心范式，但当只迁移上游模型的部分参数时，目前缺乏理论理解来阐明这种部分参数重用的有益条件及其效果影响因素。

Method: 在ReLU卷积神经网络的理论框架下进行分析，通过数值实验和真实世界数据实验来验证理论发现。

Result: 研究揭示了继承参数如何作为通用知识载体，并识别了放大其在目标任务上有益影响的关键因素。

Conclusion: 分析提供了关于参数迁移有效性的理论见解，解释了在某些情况下参数迁移可能导致比从头训练更差性能的原因，并通过实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 激活引导技术通过向LLM隐藏状态添加语义向量来控制模型行为，但研究发现该方法会系统性破坏模型的安全防护，使模型更容易响应有害请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证激活引导技术是否真的比微调更安全、更精确，探究其对模型安全性的实际影响。

Method: 在不同模型系列上进行广泛实验，测试随机方向引导和基于稀疏自编码器的良性特征引导对有害请求合规率的影响。

Result: 随机方向引导使有害合规率从0%提升到2-27%；基于SAE的良性特征引导进一步增加2-4%；组合20个随机向量可创建通用攻击，显著提高对未见请求的有害合规率。

Conclusion: 激活引导技术会破坏模型安全防护，精确控制模型内部状态并不能保证精确控制模型行为，这对可解释性安全范式提出了挑战。

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

TL;DR: NL-SME方法通过引入非线性参数轨迹建模，显著提升了联邦学习中梯度反转攻击的效果，相比线性方法在多个指标上取得数量级改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然通过本地数据保护隐私，但梯度反转攻击仍构成威胁。现有方法假设线性参数轨迹，严重低估了SGD的非线性复杂性，限制了攻击效果。

Method: 提出非线性代理模型扩展(NL-SME)，用可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线替代线性插值，通过控制点捕捉SGD的曲线特性，结合正则化和dvec缩放机制增强表达能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和FEMNIST数据集上的实验表明，NL-SME在所有指标上显著优于基线方法，在余弦相似度损失上实现数量级改进，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦学习多步更新范式中的隐私漏洞，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a range

challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce
SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of
Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency
and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting
the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN.
Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks
demonstrate that SHAKE-GNN achieves competitive performance while offering
improved scalability.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注模型更新的鲁棒性，而忽视了追索建议的时间动态特性，特别是在竞争性资源受限环境中，建议会影响未来申请者群体

Method: 引入时间感知的算法追索框架，建模候选人群对建议的适应性响应，并开发基于强化学习的追索算法来捕捉环境演化动态

Result: 在复杂模拟环境中的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，在可行性和长期有效性之间实现了更好的平衡

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了将时间和行为动态纳入实际追索系统设计的重要性

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

Motivation: 心理属性通常不是孤立运作的，而是相互关联的网络。需要一种能够处理混合类型变量（序数问卷得分、分类人口统计、连续指标）的方法来学习这些有向关系。

Method: 提出了latent MMHC方法，结合潜在高斯copula和基于约束的骨架，通过约束的基于分数的细化来返回单个DAG。还研究了用于稳定性的bootstrap聚合变体。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动心理学特征分析提供了一个可解释的、数据驱动的框架，并为运动员发展决策提供支持。

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

Motivation: 对抗性机器学习挑战了训练和实现预测模型时底层分布保持一致的假设。在回归场景中，现有的悲观双层优化方法尚未适应，需要开发能够处理非凸和多重对手策略的鲁棒回归方法。

Method: 提出了一种悲观双层优化程序，专门针对回归场景设计，不假设对手最优策略的凸性或唯一性，能够捕捉对手的对抗性质。

Result: 该方法能够有效建模回归场景中的对抗性规避问题，为构建对抗性攻击下更鲁棒的回归模型提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 悲观双层优化方法可以成功扩展到回归场景，为对抗性机器学习在回归任务中的应用提供了新的解决方案，特别是在需要处理非凸和多重对手策略的复杂环境中。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无critic方法如GRPO中因大量无信息样本和token导致学习信号稀释、收敛缓慢的问题。

Method: D$^3$S框架包含：样本级选择优势方差最大的rollouts；token级选择优势幅度与策略熵乘积高的token；采用动态下采样调度防止过拟合。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上的实验表明，D$^3$S集成到先进RL算法中实现了SOTA性能和泛化，同时需要更少的样本和token。

Conclusion: D$^3$S通过优先处理信息量最大的样本和token，有效提升了策略优化的效率和效果。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: VITAL是一个基于大语言模型的框架，专门用于处理电子健康记录中不规则采样的生理时间序列数据，通过区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型，分别采用不同的编码策略来处理缺失值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的时间序列数据存在不规则采样和高缺失率的问题，临床变量根据工作流程和干预时间以不均匀间隔测量，这给建模带来了挑战。

Method: VITAL框架区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型：将生命体征重新编程到语言空间，使LLM能够捕获时间上下文并通过显式编码推理缺失值；实验室变量则使用代表性汇总值或可学习的[未测量]标记进行嵌入。

Result: 在PhysioNet基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，VITAL优于为不规则时间序列设计的最先进方法，并在高缺失率情况下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: VITAL能够有效处理真实临床场景中普遍存在的高缺失率问题，在电子健康记录的不规则采样时间序列建模方面表现出色。

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

TL;DR: 提出了双切片Wasserstein（DSW）距离作为Wasserstein over Wasserstein（WoW）距离的可扩展替代方案，通过利用1维Wasserstein空间与函数空间L2([0,1])之间的等距性，避免了现有方法的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的切片WoW加速方法依赖于参数化元测度或高阶矩的存在，导致数值不稳定性。需要一种更稳定且计算效率高的方法来比较数据集或图像和形状的分布。

Method: 利用1维Wasserstein空间与函数空间L2([0,1])之间的等距性，引入一个通用的Banach空间切片Wasserstein框架，通过高斯过程参数化的无限维L2投影定义1维元测度的切片距离，结合欧几里得单位球上的经典积分得到DSW度量。

Result: 数值实验在数据集、形状和图像上验证了DSW作为WoW距离的可扩展替代方案的有效性，同时避免了不稳定的高阶矩并实现了计算节省。

Conclusion: DSW最小化对于离散化元测度等价于WoW最小化，同时避免了不稳定的高阶矩问题，提供了计算效率更高的替代方案。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了LLM中后训练N:M激活剪枝方法，发现激活剪枝比权重剪枝在相同稀疏度下能更好地保持生成能力，并推荐8:16稀疏模式作为硬件友好方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM推理需求增长，稀疏化技术备受关注。虽然半结构化(N:M)权重剪枝已成熟，但激活剪枝研究不足，尽管它具有动态输入自适应压缩和减少I/O开销的潜力。

Method: 评估了轻量级即插即用的误差缓解技术和剪枝标准，建立了硬件友好的基线方法，仅需最小校准。探索了超越NVIDIA标准2:4的稀疏模式，包括16:32和8:16模式。

Result: 在多个LLM上，激活剪枝在相同稀疏度下比权重剪枝能更好地保持生成能力。16:32模式性能接近非结构化稀疏，但考虑到灵活性和硬件实现复杂性，8:16模式是更优选择。

Conclusion: 研究为激活剪枝提供了有效的实用方法，并为未来硬件支持更灵活稀疏模式提供了动机。8:16稀疏模式在性能和硬件友好性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

TL;DR: DYNAWEIGHT是一个用于多智能体网络信息聚合的新框架，通过动态分配权重来加速去中心化学习，在数据异构场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化基础设施中，由于缺乏中央聚合，本地处理变得至关重要。传统静态权重分配方法无法有效处理数据异构问题。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT基于邻居服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失动态分配权重，优先选择具有多样化信息的服务器。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100数据集上的实验表明，DYNAWEIGHT显著提高了训练速度，且兼容任何底层服务器级优化算法。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT作为一种通用聚合方案，具有广泛集成潜力，能够在最小通信和内存开销下加速去中心化学习。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效发现数据中的对称群并学习相应的等变函数，通过引入适当的归纳偏置实现了模型的简化和高效性。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

Result: 证明了每种独立性准则都能在非线性、不可逆混合下识别潜在子空间，建立了这些准则之间的层次关系。

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了在不依赖统计假设的情况下解缠表示可识别的条件，为解缠学习提供了更稳健的理论基础。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

*Mu Huang,Linning Xu,Mingyue Dai,Yidi Shao,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了R-GNS（可逆图网络模拟器），这是一个统一的框架，通过残差可逆消息传递和共享参数，在单一图架构中实现双向一致性，用于耗散流体系统的正向模拟和逆向推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体动力学中，模拟物理上合理的轨迹向用户定义的目标是一个基本但具有挑战性的任务。基于粒子的模拟器可以高效地再现正向动力学，但逆向推理仍然困难，特别是在耗散系统中，动力学是不可逆的，基于优化的求解器速度慢、不稳定且经常无法收敛。

Method: 提出了R-GNS框架，基于残差可逆消息传递和共享参数，在单一图架构中强制执行双向一致性。该方法不试图逆转基础物理，而是通过数学可逆设计耦合正向动力学与逆向推理。

Result: 在三个耗散基准测试（Water-3D、WaterRamps和WaterDrop）上的实验表明，R-GNS实现了更高的准确性和一致性，参数数量仅为四分之一，逆向推理速度比基于优化的基线快100倍以上。在目标条件任务中，它消除了迭代优化并实现了数量级的速度提升。

Conclusion: R-GNS是第一个统一耗散流体系统正向和逆向模拟的可逆框架，能够通过生动、物理一致的轨迹实现复杂目标形状（如字符'L'和'N'）。

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

Motivation: 解决多路数据插补问题，特别是动态图流中缺失值的估计，需要既灵活又参数高效的方法。

Method: 采用非参数回归框架，通过固定张量列车秩的张量实现参数效率，使用Hadamard过参数化促进稀疏性，在黎曼流形上求解平滑逆问题。

Result: 在真实世界图数据集上的数值测试表明，KReTTaH在插补缺失的时间变化边流方面持续优于最先进的替代方法。

Conclusion: KReTTaH提供了一个灵活且参数高效的框架，能够无缝整合图结构先验，在多路数据插补任务中表现卓越。

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

Motivation: SO(n)的单参数子群在机器人学、量子力学和分子结构分析等广泛应用中至关重要，需要自动发现这些子群结构的方法。

Method: 利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式建立轨道规范形式，通过参数学习发现潜在的单参数子群Hγ，并推导Hγ不变函数的标准化表示。

Result: 在双摆建模、惯性矩预测、顶夸克标记和不变多项式回归等任务中成功恢复了有意义的子群结构，并产生了可解释的对称感知表示。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效发现SO(n)的单参数子群，为对称性感知的表示学习提供了有力工具，在多个应用领域展现出良好性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Method: 使用随机特征模型进行分析，提出基于特征空间训练样本子空间的优化方法，通过模型参数重构输入数据，并在多种架构上验证。

Result: 当p > dn时，可以从模型参数中成功重构整个训练数据集，在随机特征、两层全连接和深度残差网络等架构上都表现良好。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据重建的阈值规律：当模型参数数量超过数据维度与样本数的乘积时，整个训练数据集可以被完全重构。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

Motivation: 现实世界序列决策问题需要公平性，但性能与公平性的权衡难以预先确定，需要算法能够探索多种权衡方案并提供透明决策。

Method: 提出扩展的马尔可夫决策过程fMDP，显式编码个体和群体，形式化序列决策中的公平概念，建立公平性框架计算时间维度上的公平度量。

Result: 在招聘和欺诈检测场景中，框架学习到的策略在多个场景下更加公平，仅带来轻微的性能奖励损失，且发现群体公平和个体公平不一定相互蕴含。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不同问题设置中平衡性能与公平性，为利益相关者选择最合适策略提供指导，并提供了跨问题应用的指南。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

Motivation: 现有形式化语句相似性度量方法无法平衡语义和结构信息：基于字符串的方法忽略语义，基于证明的方法缺乏分级相似性评分。

Method: 将形式化语句转换为操作符树捕获句法结构，使用TransTED相似性度量（增强的树编辑距离）结合语义变换来计算相似度。

Conclusion: ASSESS框架通过语义和结构信息的综合集成，为形式化语句相似性评估提供了有效的连续评分方法。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary
Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to
graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE,
recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

TL;DR: 本文提出Ssiuu方法，通过属性引导的正则化来防止虚假的负向影响，实现对大语言模型中敏感知识的可靠擦除，解决了现有遗忘方法中浅层对齐和知识重新学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法存在"浅层对齐"问题，只是通过产生虚假的遗忘神经元来隐藏目标知识，而非真正擦除，导致在后续训练中知识容易被重新学习，存在显著的隐私风险。

Method: 引入Ssiuu方法，采用属性引导的正则化技术，防止产生虚假的负向影响，从而忠实移除目标知识。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒且忠实的遗忘方法对于语言模型安全部署的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构虽然性能优异且推理成本低，但参数量大导致内存需求过高，限制了实际部署。现有的专家级剪枝方法粒度太粗，会导致显著的精度损失。

Method: 将专家分解为更小的原子专家，利用类似OBS理论的二阶信息来评估原子专家重要性。通过将专家参数的二阶信息转换为原子专家参数和输出的二阶信息，将空间复杂度从O(d^4)降低到O(d^2)。仅需在小校准集上进行两次前向传播和一次反向传播。

Result: 在DeepSeek MoE和Qwen MoE系列模型上的实验表明，HEAPr在广泛的压缩比和基准测试中优于现有专家级剪枝方法。在20%~25%压缩比下实现近乎无损压缩，同时减少近20%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: HEAPr通过原子专家剪枝和高效二阶信息利用，为MoE模型提供了更精确、高效的压缩方案，显著提升了实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

*Nassim Walha,Sebastian G. Gruber,Thomas Decker,Yinchong Yang,Alireza Javanmardi,Eyke Hüllermeier,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spectral Uncertainty的新方法，利用量子信息理论中的冯·诺依曼熵来量化和分解大语言模型中的不确定性，将总不确定性分为内在的数据模糊性（偶然不确定性）和模型局限性（认知不确定性）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各类应用中的集成日益广泛，获取可靠的预测不确定性度量变得至关重要。需要精确区分来自输入数据内在模糊性的偶然不确定性和仅来自模型局限性的认知不确定性，以便有效处理每种不确定性来源。

Method: 引入Spectral Uncertainty方法，利用量子信息理论中的冯·诺依曼熵，为分离总不确定性为不同的偶然和认知成分提供了严格的理论基础。与现有基线方法不同，该方法结合了语义相似性的细粒度表示，能够在模型响应的各种语义解释之间进行细致区分。

Result: 实证评估表明，Spectral Uncertainty在估计各种模型和基准数据集中的偶然不确定性和总不确定性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Spectral Uncertainty提供了一种有效的方法来量化和分解大语言模型中的不确定性，在区分偶然和认知不确定性方面表现出色，有助于更好地理解和处理模型预测的不确定性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 传统MoE架构在时间序列分析中存在任务无关路由和缺乏通道相关性建模能力的问题，无法适应多样化的时间序列任务需求。

Method: 提出Recurrent Noisy Gating机制利用层次信息进行路由，设计Temporal & Channel Load Balancing Loss来建模时间和通道相关性，在时间和通道维度上进行路由操作。

Result: 在五个下游任务上的综合实验表明PatchMoE实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PatchMoE通过任务感知路由和通道相关性建模，成功解决了传统MoE在时间序列分析中的局限性，为多样化时间序列任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

TL;DR: 提出了Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB)，一种元迁移强化学习方法，通过插入轻量级线性层实现参数高效微调，在任务不匹配情况下提升样本效率并适应分布外任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习需要大量交互数据，实际部署受限。现有方法依赖先验知识但任务不匹配时性能下降，且主要局限于分布内设置。

Method: 在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调，在适应过程中保留先验知识。

Result: APB相比标准RL提升了样本效率，在现有元RL基线通常失败的分布外任务上也能成功适应。

Conclusion: APB方法通过参数高效微调有效解决了任务不匹配问题，在分布外任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散自编码器的无线语义通信系统，通过学习从语义空间到真实分布的映射来解决传统自编码器方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信系统主要关注信道自适应神经编解码方案，缺乏对信号分布的充分探索，且采用的自编码器架构存在编码与解码紧密耦合的可扩展性问题。

Method: 在语义发射端使用神经编码器提取高级语义，在语义接收端使用条件扩散模型进行信号空间去噪，将接收到的语义潜在变量作为条件输入来引导解码过程。

Result: 分析证明所提出的解码器模型是真实数据的一致估计器，在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上的仿真显示其性能优于传统自编码器和变分自编码器。

Conclusion: 扩散自编码器模型为无线语义通信提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够更好地学习语义到真实分布的映射，在多用户场景下也表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出渐进式权重加载(PWL)方法，在保持初始推理速度的同时，通过逐步加载教师模型层来提升学生模型性能，最终达到教师模型的精度水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型日益庞大复杂，导致内存消耗和计算需求增加，模型加载时间和初始推理延迟显著上升，在移动端和延迟敏感环境中影响用户体验。

Method: 首先部署轻量级学生模型，然后逐步用预训练教师模型的层替换学生模型的层。引入训练方法对齐学生和教师层的中间特征表示，并提升学生模型的整体输出性能。

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL训练的模型保持了有竞争力的蒸馏性能，随着教师层的加载，准确率逐步提升，最终达到完整教师模型的精度，且不损害初始推理速度。

Conclusion: PWL特别适合动态、资源受限的部署场景，既能保证响应性又能确保性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

TL;DR: 提出基于多目标非凸约束松弛模型的高效超图划分框架，使用改进的加速近端梯度算法生成多样化顶点特征，结合MST策略和细化策略，在多个基准测试中优于现有划分器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图划分方法容易陷入局部最优，划分质量有待提升，特别是在大规模数据和加权顶点集上的表现需要改进。

Method: 使用多目标非凸约束松弛模型和加速近端梯度算法生成多样化顶点特征；针对不同数据规模采用两种MST策略：小数据用Prim算法构建MST后剪枝聚类，大数据选择代表性节点构建小MST；引入贪婪迁移、交换和递归MST聚类等细化策略。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，相比KaHyPar在2、3、4路划分中平均减少2%-5%的割边规模，特定实例提升达35%；在加权顶点集上优于KaHyPar、hMetis、Mt-KaHyPar和K-SpecPart；细化策略可将hMetis划分结果提升达16%。

Conclusion: 该算法在超图划分质量和效率方面具有显著优势，特别是在加权顶点集上表现优异，验证了其竞争力和性能权衡特性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列预测中的跨域泛化问题，现有单模态基础模型无法显式利用文本等模态中的领域知识，而端到端多模态模型不支持零样本推理。

Method: 通过分词、编码和蒸馏提取多模态领域知识，使用模态引导的多头自注意力机制将其注入时间表示建模，在解码阶段采用原型引导的流匹配进行生成式概率预测。

Result: 在TimeMMD、TSFM-Bench和ProbTS等基准测试中，Aurora在单模态和多模态场景下均表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Aurora通过有效利用多模态领域知识，在跨域时间序列预测中展现出强大的泛化能力，支持零样本推理。

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络在持续学习中失去可塑性的根本原因，即无法学习新任务而需要重新初始化参数的问题。

Method: 引入τ-可训练性概念，基于Hessian的Kronecker分解近似，提出两种正则化增强方法：维持高有效特征秩和应用L2惩罚。

Result: 在持续监督学习和强化学习任务上的实验表明，结合这两种正则化器能有效保持神经网络的可塑性。

Conclusion: Hessian谱崩溃是导致神经网络失去可塑性的关键因素，通过针对性的正则化方法可以有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

Motivation: 生存数据通常包含不完整的事件信息（如删失），这对合成数据生成提出了独特挑战，需要同时忠实再现事件时间分布和删失机制。

Method: 提出SurvDiff扩散模型，使用生存定制的损失函数联合生成协变量、事件时间和右删失，该损失函数编码时间到事件结构并直接优化下游生存任务。

Conclusion: SurvDiff是首个专门为生成合成生存数据设计的扩散模型，能够真实再现事件时间分布并保持删失机制。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

Result: 在溶剂产率预测任务中，SoDaDE表现优于之前的表示方法。

Conclusion: 证明了即使使用小数据集也能创建有效的数据驱动指纹，并建立了可扩展到其他应用的工作流程。

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

Motivation: 当前基于静态世界模型的方法在面对新颖或罕见配置时表现不佳，因此需要研究能够自我适应的世界模型，以更好地预测环境动态。

Method: 形式化了世界模型的上下文学习，识别了两个核心机制(环境识别和环境学习)，推导了误差上界，并通过实验验证这些机制在不同数据分布和模型架构下的表现。

Result: 实验证实了世界模型中存在不同的上下文学习机制，并且数据分布和模型架构以与理论一致的方式影响上下文学习。

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入区域梯度消失的问题，同时利用RELU的稀疏性优势来减少推理计算量。

Method: 使用伯努利分布随机选择SILU或RELU激活函数，在预训练阶段使用随机激活，微调阶段固定为RELU以获得稀疏表示。

Result: 相比从头训练RELU模型，该方法在CPU推理时显著加速且效果更好；在生成任务中表现接近最佳确定性非线性函数SILU。

Conclusion: 随机激活策略有效解决了RELU的优化问题，提供了控制文本生成多样性的新方法，同时实现了推理效率的提升。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

Motivation: CFR算法在多玩家游戏中计算复杂度指数级增长，且纳什均衡在三人及以上游戏中无法保证不输结果，限制了其在流行比赛形式中的应用。受LLM在棋类游戏中成功的启发，希望用LLM解决多人不完全信息游戏问题。

Method: 两阶段训练：1）在32万手高额专家决策上进行监督微调；2）在27万手求解器生成的对局上进行强化学习。

Result: 与求解器决策匹配度达78%（容忍准确率）；使用简单深筹码启发式方法，在与Slumbot的3万手对战中达到13.4±12.9 BB/100的成绩（95%置信区间）。

Conclusion: LLM可能成为处理多人不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information
games like poker.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and associative
memorization has recently been noted to underlie the operation of modern neural
architectures such as Transformers. This work addresses a distributed setting
where agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as
selective information from others. Specifically, we introduce a distributed
online gradient descent method that optimizes local AMs at different agents
through communication over routing trees. Our theoretical analysis establishes
sublinear regret guarantees, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed
protocol consistently outperforms existing online optimization baselines.

*Anastasiia Filippova,Angelos Katharopoulos,David Grangier,Ronan Collobert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种内存和计算效率高的低通信分布式训练方法，通过限制反向传播只更新部分参数来减少峰值内存使用和训练FLOPs，同时保持全前向传播避免跨节点激活交换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练方法通过减少全局同步频率来降低通信开销，但其效率仍有提升空间，特别是在内存使用和计算成本方面。

Method: 在局部更新步骤中，每个节点只更新固定的参数子集，其余参数保持冻结，同时进行完整的全参数前向传播以避免跨节点激活交换。

Result: 在32个节点上训练13亿参数语言模型的实验表明，该方法在相同token和带宽预算下与现有低通信方法达到相似的困惑度，同时显著减少了训练FLOPs和峰值内存使用。

Conclusion: 通过限制反向传播范围，该方法实现了更高效的低通信分布式训练，在保持模型性能的同时大幅降低了计算和内存开销。

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

Motivation: 神经ODE在训练中面临梯度计算精度和收敛分析的挑战，需要研究激活函数特性如何影响训练动态。

Method: 分析激活函数的平滑性和非线性特性，建立神经ODE在过参数化机制下的全局收敛理论，并通过数值实验验证。

Result: 平滑激活函数保证前向和后向ODE的全局唯一解，充分非线性维持神经切核的谱特性，从而实现梯度下降的全局收敛。

Conclusion: 激活函数的平滑性和非线性是神经ODE训练成功的关键，为实际应用中的快速训练和性能提升提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

Method: 使用编码局部相似性结构的几何图来近似输入数据流形，提供关于这些图在训练过程中演化的理论结果，并通过在合成和真实数据集上训练超过20,000个前馈神经网络进行实验验证。

Result: 发现非线性激活在前馈神经网络中塑造特征几何方面起关键作用，几何变换类似于图上的离散Ricci流，类可分性的出现对应于相关图表示中社区结构的出现。

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

TL;DR: 本文基于科尔莫戈罗夫复杂度理论，为Transformer网络建立了渐近最优描述长度目标的理论框架，证明其可实现最优压缩，并构建了可微分的变分目标，在算法任务上展现了良好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最小描述长度原则在神经网络中的应用面临挑战，因为缺乏对模型复杂度的原则性度量。本文旨在为Transformer网络建立具有理论保证的描述长度目标框架。

Method: 基于科尔莫戈罗夫复杂度理论构建渐近最优描述长度目标，证明Transformer的计算普适性，并设计基于自适应高斯混合先验的可微分变分目标。

Result: 理论证明渐近最优目标存在且可实现最优压缩，实验表明变分目标能选择低复杂度解并在算法任务上实现强泛化，但标准优化器难以从随机初始化找到此类解。

Conclusion: 通过提供具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标理论框架，为训练实现更好压缩和泛化的神经网络指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

*Lovenya Jain,Pooneh Mousavi,Mirco Ravanelli,Cem Subakan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型音频语言模型（LALMs）中思维链（CoT）的忠实性，发现尽管在文本LLMs中CoT常不忠实，但LALMs生成的CoT通常能忠实反映其决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LALMs中CoT的忠实性，这对安全敏感应用至关重要，且音频推理比文本更具挑战性，需要先提取音频线索再进行推理。

Method: 通过应用定向干预（包括转述、填充标记注入、提前回答和引入错误）在两个具有挑战性的推理数据集（SAKURA和MMAR）上评估多个LALMs。

Result: 实验表明，LALMs生成的CoT总体上似乎忠实于其底层决策过程。

Conclusion: 与文本LLMs不同，LALMs产生的CoT在多个数据集和任务中表现出较高的忠实性。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

TL;DR: PIGNN-Attn-LS结合边缘感知注意力机制和回溯线搜索校正算子，显著提升了物理信息图神经网络在交流潮流计算中的精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物理信息图神经网络在推理时物理损失不起作用，这阻碍了其在电力系统运行中的实际应用，需要改进精度和推理能力。

Method: 采用边缘感知注意力机制显式编码线路物理特性，结合基于回溯线搜索的全局化校正算子，在推理时恢复有效的下降准则。

Result: 在4-32节点高压电网测试中，电压和相角测试RMSE分别达到0.00033 p.u.和0.08°，比基线PIGNN-MLP分别提升99.5%和87.1%，在4-1024节点电网上的批处理推理速度比牛顿-拉夫逊法快2-5倍。

Conclusion: PIGNN-Attn-LS通过结合注意力机制和校正算子，成功解决了物理信息图神经网络在推理时物理损失失效的问题，实现了高精度和快速推理。

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中多模态检测的挑战，允许客户端灵活使用不同模态的检测器，同时保护隐私并避免跨模态嵌入冲突。

Method: 在FedProx基础上提出角色感知桶聚合，采用硬门控选择图像/HTML/URL专家，分别聚合模态特定参数。使用GraphCodeBERT处理URL，三路嵌入处理原始HTML。

Result: 在TR-OP数据集上融合头准确率达97.5%，误报率2.4%；图像子集准确率95.5%，误报率5.9%；WebPhish(HTML)准确率96.5%，误报率1.8%；TR-OP(原始HTML)准确率95.1%，误报率4.6%。

Conclusion: 桶聚合与硬门控专家机制能够在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时提高多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

Motivation: 解决分子表示学习中标记数据稀缺的问题，现有方法要么依赖人工设计的增强策略，要么仅使用2D拓扑信息而未能充分利用3D结构信息。

Method: 使用固定半径的ego-net作为建模单元，通过预测子图嵌入与其互补邻域在潜在空间中的关系来学习分子表示，结合2D图和3D构象集合，采用混合GNN-Transformer架构。

Result: 在GEOM数据集上预训练后，在MoleculeNet上取得了最先进的结果，超越了对比学习、生成式和其他多模态自监督方法。

Conclusion: 3D信息增强的分子表示能够有效迁移到新的化学领域，证明了3D结构信息在分子表示学习中的重要性。

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感应用中，大语言模型需要能够遗忘特定知识（如用户请求、版权材料、过时信息），以满足监管合规、用户隐私和安全要求，而无需从头重新训练。

Method: 采用惩罚性双层优化框架，内层最大化步骤通过相似性感知惩罚强制遗忘，外层最小化步骤恢复模型效用，并开发了具有收敛保证的两循环算法。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，OFMU在遗忘效果和保留效用方面均优于现有遗忘方法，实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: OFMU通过明确优先处理遗忘目标并保持保留性能，提供了一种有效的机器遗忘解决方案，具有更好的遗忘效果和模型效用权衡。

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Conclusion: 使用基于损失函数的稀疏化技术相比随机分布方法可以获得更好的结果，在降低模型复杂度的同时保持性能表现。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction,
indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified
through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison
revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA,
suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the
biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as
sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在持续学习中，激活函数的选择是缓解塑性损失的关键因素，作者提出了两种新的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），并在监督学习和强化学习环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐失去适应能力（塑性损失），而激活函数在这一失效模式中的作用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 基于对负分支形状和饱和行为的属性级分析，提出了两种即插即用的非线性激活函数，并在监督类增量基准和非平稳MuJoCo环境的强化学习中进行评估。

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的激活函数能够在不需要额外容量或任务特定调整的情况下，持续维持持续学习中的塑性。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计提供了一种轻量级、领域通用的方法来维持持续学习中的塑性。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning

TL;DR: 本研究评估了不同多步预测方法和机器学习模型对混合系统准确性的影响，发现ARIMA-LSTM混合模型在递归方法下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利率下降和经济稳定化提高了死亡率预测的重要性，特别是在保险和养老金市场。多步预测对公共卫生、人口规划和保险风险评估至关重要，但在数据有限时面临挑战。

Method: 使用混合系统结合统计和机器学习模型处理线性和非线性模式，评估了三种多步预测方法（递归、直接、多输入多输出）和多种ML模型。

Result: 基于12个数据集和21个模型的实验结果显示，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型在递归方法下在大多数情况下优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 多步预测方法和ML模型的选择对提高混合系统性能至关重要，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型在递归方法下表现最优。

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督方法，将高维策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，通过行为重建损失训练生成模型，使潜在空间按功能相似性而非参数邻近性组织。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习样本效率低，主要原因是直接在冗余的高维参数空间中优化策略，这在多任务设置中问题更严重。

Method: 训练生成模型将策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，使用行为重建损失确保潜在空间按功能相似性组织，然后在潜在空间中进行策略梯度优化。

Result: 在连续控制领域验证，标准策略网络的参数化可压缩五个数量级，同时保持大部分表达能力，学习的流形支持在潜在空间中进行任务特定适应。

Conclusion: 策略参数空间的内在维度取决于环境复杂性而非网络大小，压缩参数空间可显著提高样本效率，并为多任务学习提供有效框架。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界视觉环境中难以获得精确位置信息，传统基于距离的奖励设计方法不适用，需要新的奖励设计方法。

Method: 使用关键点提取空间距离，学习预测模型作为规划器提出中间子目标，在分层强化学习框架下训练目标条件策略。

Result: 在复杂长视界操作任务上显著加速学习并实现优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: ReLAM通过自动生成结构化奖励有效解决了视觉强化学习中的奖励设计问题，为机器人操作提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 该方法能够在训练过程中保持良好平衡的熵范围，早期积累工具使用技能，后期加速解决方案迭代，同时避免无界熵增长。

Conclusion: SPEAR通过课程式自模仿学习有效解决了RL训练中的探索-利用权衡问题，实现了稳定的策略演化，为智能LLM代理训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoveFM-R是一个新颖的移动性基础模型框架，通过结合语言驱动的语义推理能力，解决了移动性建模中的数据规模和语义理解限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的移动性基础模型在数据规模和语义理解方面存在限制，而大型语言模型虽然具有强大的语义推理能力，但缺乏对时空统计的固有理解。需要结合两者的优势来生成物理上合理的移动轨迹。

Method: MoveFM-R包含三个核心创新：语义增强的位置编码来弥合地理-语言差距，渐进式课程来对齐LLM推理与移动模式，以及交互式自反机制用于条件轨迹生成。

Result: 广泛实验表明，MoveFM-R显著优于现有的基于MFM和LLM的基线方法，在零样本设置中表现出强大的泛化能力，并能从自然语言指令生成逼真的轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过将MFMs的统计能力与LLMs的深度语义理解相结合，MoveFM-R开创了一个新的范式，实现了更全面、可解释和强大的人类移动性建模。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE)方法，通过使用分位数基线替代均值基线来解决RLVR训练中的熵崩溃和熵爆炸问题，实现稳定的强化学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中存在熵崩溃和熵爆炸的振荡问题，根源在于基于均值的价值无强化学习方法对负优势样本的不当惩罚。

Method: 提出QAE方法，用分组K分位数基线替代均值基线，在困难查询中强化罕见成功，在简单查询中针对剩余失败。

Result: QAE稳定了熵变化，稀疏化了信用分配（约80%响应获得零优势），在Qwen3-8B/14B-Base模型上持续提升AIME 2024/2025和AMC 2023的pass@1性能。

Conclusion: 基线设计（而非token级启发式）是扩展RLVR的主要机制。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

Conclusion: 为动力学系统建模建立了一条新的数据驱动途径，能够有效处理复杂流动行为，同时保持对碰撞模型和网格分辨率的通用性。

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

Conclusion: 图提示学习应专注于释放预训练模型的能力，而分类器应适应下游场景，UniPrompt方法为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

Motivation: 研究ICL的内部计算能否用于改进SFT的质量，因为ICL在数据稀缺情况下比SFT具有更好的泛化性和校准响应。

Method: 引入ICL激活对齐(IA2)自蒸馏技术，在SFT前进行激活模式对齐，激励模型进行ICL式的内部推理。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实验表明，IA2显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: IA2不仅具有实用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

Result: 证明了生成分布与目标分布之间的总变差距离受学习速度场风险控制，并提供了首个正式证明：训练后的DFM模型生成分布会收敛到真实数据分布。

Conclusion: 本文为DFM模型建立了完整的理论分析框架，证明了其在数据量增加时能够收敛到真实分布，为离散生成建模提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

TL;DR: 该研究解决了博弈学习中时间延迟反馈的问题，提出了加权乐观跟随正则化领导者算法(WOFTRL)，通过调整乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响，在乐观权重超过时间延迟时能够恢复良好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 博弈学习中多个智能体独立学习策略会导致优化差异，虽然乐观跟随正则化领导者算法(OFTRL)通过预测未来奖励来解决这个问题，但过去奖励的观测时间延迟会阻碍预测效果，即使单步延迟也会恶化OFTRL的性能。

Method: 提出了加权OFTRL(WOFTRL)算法，其中OFTRL中下一个奖励的预测向量被加权n倍。关键直觉是乐观权重可以抵消时间延迟的影响。

Result: 当乐观权重超过时间延迟时，WOFTRL能够恢复良好性能：在一般和正规形式博弈中实现常数遗憾(O(1)-regret)，在多矩阵零和博弈中策略作为子序列收敛到纳什均衡(最佳迭代收敛)。

Conclusion: 理论分析表明WOFTRL能够有效应对博弈学习中的时间延迟问题，实验验证并强化了理论结果，证明通过适当设置乐观权重可以抵消时间延迟带来的负面影响。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

Conclusion: CEA方法能有效学习可采纳启发式，同时通过神经网络结构而非图大小的依赖关系，为A*算法提供了更好的泛化保证。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

Result: IPFM产生的蒸馏生成器仅需少量函数评估就能达到接近教师甚至更优的样本质量。有限D值的蒸馏收敛速度比D→∞（扩散模型）时更快。

Conclusion: IPFM是加速静电生成模型的有效蒸馏框架，特别在有限D值时表现出更优越的优化和采样特性，为高效生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在GPU上优化预训练神经网络的简化空间公式，将神经网络视为"灰盒"，不向优化求解器暴露中间变量和约束，相比完整空间公式能获得更快的求解速度和更少的迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的完整空间优化方法将神经网络的中间变量和约束暴露给求解器，导致计算效率低下。本文旨在通过简化空间公式提高优化效率，特别是在GPU环境中。

Method: 将神经网络视为"灰盒"，只暴露输入和输出给优化求解器，中间变量和约束被隐藏。在GPU上评估网络输出和导数，采用内点法进行优化。

Result: 与完整空间公式相比，简化空间公式在求解速度和迭代次数方面都有显著提升，在两个优化问题上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 简化空间公式为优化预训练神经网络提供了一种高效的方法，特别适合在GPU环境中处理大规模优化问题。

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高阶数值方法虽然能提升Transformer在NLP和CV任务中的性能，但带来了计算开销增加的效率问题。现有效率优化技术（如蒸馏）可能损害这些模型的性能。

Method: 1. 提出IIET：使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法；2. 提出IIAD：基于迭代影响感知的蒸馏方法，通过灵活阈值平衡性能与效率。

Result: 在lm-evaluation-harness上，IIET比原始Transformer平均准确率提升2.65%，比PCformer提升0.8%。高效变体E-IIET减少55%推理开销，保持99.4%原始任务准确率。最高效变体在可比速度下比原始Transformer性能提升超过1.6%。

Conclusion: IIET和IIAD方法有效解决了高阶数值方法Transformer的性能-效率权衡问题，实现了在保持高性能的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

TL;DR: 该论文将高斯过程回归与动态模态分解相结合，解决了基于核的Koopman算子的稀疏性和超参数优化问题，提高了计算效率和抗噪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman算子作为非线性动力系统的线性表示，在多个科学领域受到关注。然而，基于核的Koopman算法存在两个普遍问题：稀疏性导致的扩展性差和超参数优化困难。

Method: 将Koopman算子理论与再生核希尔伯特空间结合，并引入高斯过程方法，统一了高斯过程回归和动态模态分解。

Result: 该方法不仅降低了计算需求，还提高了对传感器噪声的鲁棒性，同时解决了超参数优化和字典学习问题。

Conclusion: 通过高斯过程回归与动态模态分解的统一，有效缓解了基于核的Koopman算法的核心挑战，为非线性动力系统分析提供了更实用的工具。

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

Motivation: 约束优化是神经网络施加要求的强大框架，但传统的一阶方法在求解这类约束深度学习问题时存在振荡问题，且可能无法找到所有局部解。虽然增广拉格朗日方法能解决这些问题，但实践中更倾向于使用缺乏理论保证的对偶乐观上升方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了对偶乐观方法经验成功与理论基础之间的关键空白。

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Conclusion: 联合建模连续和离散过程对于构建现实且可控的生成模型至关重要，JointDiff框架在体育领域验证了这一方法的有效性。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型EEG模型主要关注编码器架构，缺乏相应容量的解码器，限制了学习特征的充分利用。

Method: 将EEG建模重新定义为序列到序列学习，在序列空间中捕获信号、标签和任务之间的层次关系，并整合离散支持样本构建上下文线索，实现上下文学习能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，即使使用基本模型组件，ECHO在多任务设置中始终优于最先进的单任务LEM，显示出卓越的泛化性和适应性。

Conclusion: ECHO通过解码器中心化设计和上下文学习机制，为EEG建模提供了更有效的多任务泛化解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

Result: 在ScienceWorld上实现最高152%性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现19.8%性能提升

Conclusion: 多轮稀疏奖励环境需要与传统RL不同的熵控制方法，EPO为LLM智能体训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CIL评估仅从少量随机序列计算均值和方差，无法捕捉完整性能范围，导致有偏估计和方差严重低估，需要更稳健的评估协议。

Method: 提出EDGE协议，基于任务间相似性与性能的正相关性，自适应识别和采样极端类别序列，以逼近真实性能分布。

Result: 实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极值，提供更准确的分布边界估计，为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供可行见解。

Conclusion: EDGE通过极端序列评估提供了更可靠的CIL性能分布表征，改进了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is

Motivation: 流匹配生成模型虽然在各领域取得了最先进的结果，但由于需要大量顺序采样步骤而推理速度缓慢。Mean Flow提供单步生成方法但无法忠实逼近原始多步流匹配过程的行为。

Method: 将最优传输采样策略整合到Mean Flow框架中，使单步生成器能够更好地保持原始多步流过程的保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: 通过结合最优传输策略，提出的方法显著提升了单步生成模型的性能，在保持快速推理的同时更好地逼近多步流匹配过程的质量。

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频扩散模型缺乏对头发动态的细粒度控制，而头发模拟和渲染面临复杂的动力学、材料属性和光线交互等挑战。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：1) 将物理参数编码为每帧几何；2) 提取每帧控制信号；3) 将控制信号输入视频扩散模型生成视频。这种级联设计将物理推理与视频生成解耦。

Result: 在10K视频数据集上训练，ControlHair在头发动态控制方面优于基于文本和姿态的基线方法。

Conclusion: ControlHair是首个基于物理信息的视频扩散框架，支持动态发型试戴、子弹时间效果和动态摄影等应用。

Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics,
diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent
video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack
fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid
framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion
to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage
pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into
per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals,
and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate
videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics
reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training
the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset,

*Weikai Lin,Sushant Kondguli,Carl Marshall,Yuhao Zhu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PowerGS是一个针对3D高斯泼溅的功耗优化框架，通过联合最小化渲染和显示功耗，在保持质量约束下实现高达86%的总功耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS系列模型在功耗受限的扩展现实设备上效率不足，这些设备需要在瓦特级别运行。

Method: 提出了一个通用问题公式化方法，包括识别显示和渲染功耗下的等质量曲线，以及找到给定曲线上功耗最小点。支持注视点渲染以进一步节省功耗。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，与最先进的3DGS模型相比，PowerGS实现了高达86%的总功耗降低，主观和客观质量损失最小。

Conclusion: PowerGS是首个在3DGS中联合最小化渲染和显示功耗的框架，为功耗受限的XR设备提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) combines classic image-based rendering,
pointbased graphics, and modern differentiable techniques, and offers an
interesting alternative to traditional physically-based rendering. 3DGS-family
models are far from efficient for power-constrained Extended Reality (XR)
devices, which need to operate at a Watt-level. This paper introduces PowerGS,
the first framework to jointly minimize the rendering and display power in 3DGS
under a quality constraint. We present a general problem formulation and show
that solving the problem amounts to 1) identifying the iso-quality curve(s) in
the landscape subtended by the display and rendering power and 2) identifying
the power-minimal point on a given curve, which has a closed-form solution
given a proper parameterization of the curves. PowerGS also readily supports
foveated rendering for further power savings. Extensive experiments and user
studies show that PowerGS achieves up to 86% total power reduction compared to
state-of-the-art 3DGS models, with minimal loss in both subjective and
objective quality. Code is available at

TL;DR: DeformSplat：从单张图像重建3D物体变形的框架，通过高斯到像素匹配和刚性部件分割实现变形引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多视角视频来恢复变形，限制了在受限场景下的应用，需要从单张图像重建物体变形的解决方案。

Method: 提出高斯到像素匹配技术弥合3D高斯表示与2D像素观测之间的领域差距；采用刚性部件分割（初始化和细化）识别刚性区域以保持几何一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于现有方法，并能自然扩展到帧插值和交互式物体操作等应用。

Conclusion: DeformSplat框架成功实现了从单张图像重建一致变形的目标，为受限场景下的变形恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on
multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under
constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel
framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single
image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we
present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D
Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust
deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part
Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation
explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric
coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach
can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame
interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种创新的无人机路径规划框架，用于同时捕获城市场景的几何结构和高质量纹理，解决了现有技术忽略纹理质量的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的城市场景重建技术往往忽视纹理质量，导致纹理模型出现明显的视觉伪影。需要在有限先验知识下解决城市几何和纹理的协同捕获问题。

Method: 使用2D建筑轮廓图和安全飞行高度作为输入，生成高质量的垂直俯视和水平平面视图。采用多目标优化策略最大化纹理保真度、提高几何精度并最小化航拍成本，并提出考虑纹理一致性的顺序路径规划算法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了城市几何和纹理的协同捕获问题，能够同时重建结构化几何和高保真纹理，为城市场景建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled
the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given
sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook
the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual
artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry
and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site
visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a
safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path
planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both
structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view
planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system,
including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method
generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to
effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective
optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity,
improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views.
Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for
texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale
synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach
effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture
reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at
low operational cost.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了多阶段长时程任务中策略组合和过渡的问题，为复杂运动技能的学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as
basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches
due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills.
A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined
goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to
the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts
and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share
significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal
states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor
skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.
Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless
and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set
of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained
by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact
with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user
commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.

### [345] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统框架来评估白盒监控器的真实性能，通过三种策略减少提示泄露对监控效果的影响，发现在欺骗检测任务中监控器性能可能被高估30-40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练和评估白盒监控器需要包含目标行为的响应样本，但用于引发这些行为的信息会泄露到监控器输入数据中，从而夸大其有效性。

Method: 提出三种评估策略：内容过滤（移除欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关token）、提示蒸馏微调模型生物（无需显式提示就能展现欺骗行为的模型）。

Result: 发现两种泄露形式会夸大监控器性能：引发泄露（来自明确请求有害行为的提示）和推理泄露（来自模型口头表达欺骗行为）。内容过滤可降低AUROC 30%，分数过滤降低15%，微调模型生物降低性能达40%。

Conclusion: 白盒监控器的性能可能被显著高估，需要更严格的评估方法来确保其检测的是真实模型行为而非表面提示特征。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于决策支点的推理验证方法，通过识别推理路径中的关键检查点来验证思维链的正确性，并利用自训练流程改进模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的思维链推理过程难以大规模验证，需要一种能够验证推理路径正确性的方法。

Method: 引入决策支点的概念，设计自训练流程：采样多样化推理路径并挖掘共享决策支点；使用辅助验证器将推理轨迹压缩为支点聚焦的短路径推理；利用自生成输出进行后训练。

Result: 在LogiQA、MedQA和MATH500等标准基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在无需真实推理数据或外部指标的情况下对齐推理过程，有效提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 该研究为民主化气候数据访问和建立可重现、可扩展的人类-AI协作科学研究框架开辟了一条途径。

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

TL;DR: 该研究使用脑电图数据和机器学习模型预测消费者行为，比较了传统机器学习模型和图神经网络模型在神经营销领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测消费者行为在市场营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中具有重要意义。脑电图数据可以提供大脑神经活动的详细信息，帮助分析决策过程。

Method: 从NeuMa数据集中提取和清理EEG特征，为GNN模型创建大脑连接特征。使用包括集成模型在内的多种传统机器学习模型和不同架构的GNN模型进行综合比较。

Result: 虽然整体结果没有显示显著差异，但GNN模型在某些传统模型表现不佳的基本标准上表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究表明结合EEG信号分析和机器学习模型可以更深入理解消费者行为，并为神经营销领域提供了传统模型（如SVM）与新兴模型（如GNN）的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的算法发现框架缺乏地理空间领域知识和多步推理能力，无法有效解决复杂的地理空间问题。

Method: 采用双循环结构：内循环使用代码进化器生成和变异候选解，外循环通过智能控制器评估全局精英，并查询GeoKnowRAG模块注入地理学理论先验知识。

Result: 在空间插值任务中减少RMSE误差13-21%，在不确定性估计任务中提升性能17%。消融研究证实领域知识引导的检索对稳定高质量进化至关重要。

Conclusion: GeoEvolve为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展路径，为可信赖和高效的AI-for-Science发现开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统F1指标在处理语义相关但非完全相同的预测时将其视为完全失败，无法反映人类标注者分歧或模糊类别边界的现实情况。

Method: 采用两步精确率-召回率公式，结合标签相似度矩阵计算软精确率和软召回率，从而得出语义F1分数，无需丢弃标签或强制匹配不相似的标签。

Result: 通过理论论证和在合成及真实数据上的广泛实证验证，语义F1分数显示出更好的可解释性和生态效度。

Conclusion: 语义F1分数通过为语义相关但不完全相同的标签给予部分分数，提供了更公平的评估，适用于各种任务和模态，只需要一个领域适当的相似度矩阵。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

TL;DR: 提出基于GRPO的框架，通过多语言预训练和有限配对数据微调，结合ASR、说话人验证和音频质量评估模型，实现低资源语言的文本到语音合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言缺乏配对的文本和语音数据，而自动语音识别模型相对容易获得，需要利用现有资源开发高质量的TTS系统。

Method: 首先使用IPA标记训练多语言基线模型，然后在有限配对数据上微调以捕捉目标语言的韵律特征，最后应用GRPO仅使用非配对文本和说话人提示进行优化。

Result: 在低资源语言中产生可理解且说话人一致的语音，显著优于仅微调的方法，在高资源语言中也优于DPO等离线对齐方法。

Conclusion: GRPO框架能有效提升低资源和高资源语言的TTS性能，在可懂度、说话人相似度和音频质量方面表现优异。

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于神经VRP求解器的终身学习框架LLR-BC，通过行为整合解决多任务学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，同时保持模型的可塑性和零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器通常基于一次性训练，当面临新任务时存在零样本泛化能力差或微调导致灾难性遗忘的问题。需要开发能够在多个不同分布和规模的任务序列中持续学习的终身学习范式。

Method: 提出LLR-BC框架，通过决策导向的行为整合方法，将新任务训练的求解器行为与缓冲的先前知识对齐。为低置信度决策分配更大的整合权重，以关注关键经验。

Result: 在容量约束车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的大量实验表明，LLR-BC在终身学习设置下能有效训练高性能神经求解器，解决灾难性遗忘问题，保持模型可塑性并提升零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，能够在多任务序列中持续学习而不遗忘先前知识，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHorizon基准测试，用于评估AI智能体在长视野、部分可观察场景下的持续推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用能力，发现现有LLM智能体在这些复杂任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注短期、完全可观察的任务，而现实世界中许多关键任务（如软件开发、投资、科学发现）需要在长视野、部分可观察场景下进行，缺乏系统性评估这些能力的基准。

Method: 通过探索任务在三个不同环境中验证核心能力，智能体需要在长视野发现任务中通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理来迭代揭示隐藏规则。

Result: 实验显示LLM智能体在这些设置中持续表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高，表明智能体在长视野能力上存在差距。简单扩展方法在任务中失败，识别出8种错误类型，归因于上下文锁定和功能基础能力差距。

Conclusion: UltraHorizon基准揭示了当前AI智能体在长视野复杂任务中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要的评估工具和方向。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

TL;DR: 提出了WebRSSBench基准测试，用于全面评估多模态大语言模型在网页理解中的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力，包含8个任务和3799个问答对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，缺乏对端到端网页应用所需的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力的评估。

Method: 从729个网站构建包含3799个问答对的基准测试，涵盖位置关系推理、颜色鲁棒性、安全关键检测等8个任务，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本和多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估了12个MLLM模型，结果显示模型在真实布局的组合推理、面对UI扰动时的鲁棒性以及识别安全关键操作方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 当前MLLM在网页理解任务中的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力仍需大幅提升，WebRSSBench为这一领域提供了全面评估框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is
available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.

TL;DR: D-Artemis是一个基于人类认知循环（思考、对齐、反思）的新型GUI代理框架，通过应用特定提示检索、预执行对齐和状态反思机制，在不依赖复杂轨迹数据集训练的情况下显著提升GUI任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理方法面临数据瓶颈、错误检测成本高和矛盾指导风险等关键挑战，需要更有效的认知框架来提升自动化任务的可靠性和效率。

Method: 提出D-Artemis框架，包含细粒度应用特定提示检索、预执行对齐（包含思想-行动一致性检查和行动校正代理）、以及后执行状态反思代理，形成完整的认知循环。

Result: 在AndroidWorld和ScreenSpot-V2基准测试中分别达到75.8%和96.8%的成功率，建立了新的最先进结果，消融研究证实各组件的重要贡献。

Conclusion: D-Artemis通过模仿人类认知循环，在不依赖复杂训练数据的情况下显著增强了通用多模态大语言模型在GUI任务中的能力，展示了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI智能体，因为缺乏真实轨迹或应用数据库，而静态的轨迹评估方法准确性有限。

Method: ProRe系统包含通用推理器和领域特定评估器。推理器调度目标状态探测任务，评估器通过主动与环境交互收集额外观察，从而为GUI智能体分配更准确可验证的奖励。

Result: 在3000多条轨迹上的实证结果显示，ProRe将奖励准确性和F1分数分别提升了5.3%和19.4%。与最先进策略智能体集成后，任务成功率提升了22.4%。

Conclusion: ProRe通过主动环境交互和协同推理，有效解决了GUI智能体奖励评估的挑战，显著提升了评估准确性和智能体性能。

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

<details>

Motivation: 数据科学任务复杂且涉及多数据源探索，但现有LLM在处理异构数据格式和验证分析计划充分性方面存在困难，需要更可靠的数据分析自动化方法。

Method: 提出DS-STAR数据科学智能体，包含三个核心组件：1) 自动探索和提取多格式数据上下文的数据文件分析模块；2) LLM验证分析计划充分性的验证步骤；3) 从简单可执行计划开始，基于反馈迭代优化的顺序规划机制。

Result: 在DABStep、KramaBench和DA-Code三个基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别是在需要处理多文件异构格式的困难任务上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DS-STAR通过迭代验证和优化机制，能够可靠地导航复杂的数据分析任务，有效解决了LLM在数据科学自动化中的局限性。

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

Method: 定义基于结构特性的决策公理分类法，通过框架分析决策与评估之间的张力关系。

Result: 发现决策-评估悖论存在于现实的公理结构中，该悖论揭示了决策数据训练和公理应用中的风险。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络（MPNNs和Transformer）在计算图建模中存在架构不匹配，无法捕捉计算的位置感知和层次化特性。

Method: 使用层次化Transformer模拟逐步计算流程，并引入函数偏移学习目标，将复杂全局函数预测分解为预测真实函数与简单局部近似之间的差异。

Result: 在电子电路等复杂计算图上，TRACE在全面基准测试中显著优于所有现有架构。

Conclusion: 架构对齐的主干网络和解耦学习目标构成了更稳健的计算图学习范式。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

Conclusion: DyRo-MCTS通过做出鲁棒调度决策，在扰动下实现了长期可持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM提供可解释分析但对对齐敏感，其异常检测能力尚不明确。

Method: 使用来自多个中心的数据，通过专家共识标注并添加合成异常，共798个有效样本和2000个异常值。评估了(i)非参数、配准依赖的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络(CNN)。通过嵌套交叉验证评估性能，通过语义差异调查评估解释质量。

Result: ML模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM误分类了临床有意义的变化并漏检了真实异常。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM被认为复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释ML在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，可解释性在将复杂模型输出转化为可解释见解以有效支持决策方面至关重要。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP

*Zhimin Wang,Shaokang He,Duo Wu,Jinghe Wang,Linjia Kang,Jing Yu,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoBel-World是一个为LLM智能体设计的协作信念世界框架，通过建模物理环境和合作者心理状态来提升多智能体协作效率，显著减少通信成本并提高任务完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作框架缺乏动态意图推理能力，导致计划不一致和冗余通信，降低了协作效率。需要让LLM智能体能够推理合作者意图以避免协调失误。

Method: 提出CoBel-World框架，让LLM智能体通过符号信念语言将开放世界任务知识解析为结构化信念，并执行零样本贝叶斯式信念更新，从而主动检测潜在协调冲突并自适应通信。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，CoBel-World相比最强基线减少22-60%通信成本，提高4-28%任务完成效率。

Conclusion: 显式的意图感知信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统中实现高效、类人协作至关重要。

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RISK框架是一个针对电商风险管理领域的GUI代理系统，包含数据集、基准测试和强化微调框架，能够处理多步骤交互任务，在单步和多步任务中分别提升6.8%和8.8%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电商风险管理中需要多步骤、有状态交互的动态内容，限制了有效的风险评估能力。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集（8,492单步和2,386多步交互轨迹）、RISK-Bench基准测试（802单步和320多步轨迹）、RISK-R1强化微调框架（考虑输出格式、单步精度、多步过程和任务难度四个方面的奖励机制）。

Result: RISK-R1在离线评估中，单步任务提升6.8%，多步任务提升8.8%；在线评估中达到70.5%的最高任务成功率。

Conclusion: RISK提供了一个可扩展的领域特定解决方案，用于自动化复杂的网络交互，推动了电商风险管理的技术进步。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

*Dong-Kyum Kim,Minsung Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文表明反转诅咒不是语言模型的固有缺陷，而是知识编码方式的产物。通过在关系知识图谱上训练，模型内部会出现双线性关系结构，这能显著缓解反转诅咒并实现一致的模型编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究反转诅咒的根本原因，探索语言模型内部知识表示的几何结构如何影响逻辑推理能力和模型编辑的一致性。

Method: 从零开始训练语言模型在合成的关系知识图谱数据集上，分析其隐藏表示中出现的双线性关系结构。

Result: 具有双线性结构的模型能够推断未见过的反向事实，并且在编辑时能正确传播到反向事实和其他逻辑依赖事实，保持逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: 模型编辑的成功不仅取决于编辑算法，更关键的是被修改知识的底层表示几何结构。关系知识训练诱导的双线性表示使语言模型在编辑后能保持逻辑一致性。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GSM-Agent基准测试，评估LLM在需要主动使用工具收集信息来解决小学数学问题时的代理推理能力，发现前沿模型准确率仅67%，并提出了基于代理推理图的分析方法和工具增强的测试时扩展方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试往往将代理推理与复杂的数学推理、专家级知识等高级能力混在一起，难以分离评估纯粹的代理推理能力。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准，要求LLM代理解决小学数学问题但只提供问题而不提供前提信息，需要主动使用工具收集信息；提出代理推理图概念来分析和可视化推理模式。

Result: 即使是GPT-5这样的前沿模型在GSM-Agent上准确率也只有67%；发现许多模型在代理推理中缺乏重新访问已访问节点的能力。

Conclusion: GSM-Agent基准和代理推理框架有助于未来理解和推进代理推理边界的研究；提出的工具增强测试时扩展方法能有效提升LLM的代理推理性能。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

Method: 进行大规模实证研究，评估多种模型融合技术，通过系统变化融合强度构建精度-效率曲线，分析可调节性能空间。

Result: 模型融合提供了一种有效且可控的方法来校准推理精度和标记效率之间的权衡，即使父模型权重空间高度发散时也有效。发现存在帕累托改进实例。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面分析了这一可调节空间，为创建具有特定推理配置的LLM以满足多样化应用需求提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在单次尝试中的表现与其潜在能力之间存在显著差距，需要通过多路径推理来充分挖掘模型潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段推理：探索器模型并行生成多个解决方案，综合器模型整合这些参考进行精炼推理，实现计算资源的正交扩展。

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill模型性能提升75%；A2R-Efficient变体（4B探索器+8B综合器）超越32B单体模型性能，成本降低30%。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是性能提升框架，更是现实应用中高效实用的解决方案，展示了非对称扩展范式的有效性。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

Motivation: 现实机器人系统需要同时平衡多个相互冲突的目标，但现有复杂的目标交互导致无法直接使用现成的先进MOS算法。

Method: 提出广义问题公式，通过隐藏目标的聚合函数优化解决方案目标，只需适当扩展核心操作以反映特定的聚合函数。

Result: 在导航、操作、医疗系统障碍不确定性规划、检查规划和路线规划等多个机器人规划问题中，扩展后的先进MOS算法比未使用目标聚合的版本性能高出数量级。

Conclusion: 该广义公式支持标准MOS算法的应用，通过适当扩展核心操作，能够在复杂机器人规划问题中实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

Motivation: 随着AI快速发展带来的环境影响日益显著，现有能耗估计工具虽然易于使用，但其准确性存在疑问，需要系统验证。

Method: 通过提出的验证框架，将静态和动态能耗估计方法与数百个AI实验的真实测量数据进行系统性比较。

Result: 现有估计方法虽然能大致反映AI能耗模式，但存在高达40%的持续误差，揭示了估计不准确的问题。

Conclusion: 本研究为可持续AI发展提供了能耗估计质量的实证证据，建立了透明度，并为改进现有工具提出了具体指南。

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM或VLM的规划-执行代理存在脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长程一致性的问题，依赖单次推理或静态计划使其在UI变化或复杂任务下表现脆弱。

Method: 结合结构化两级规划框架和用户行为日志的任务挖掘方法，通过将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典构建高层计划，然后基于实时GUI上下文将高层计划落地为低层动作序列。

Result: 在200个真实世界任务上的评估显示，任务成功率和执行时间显著改善，在长程任务序列上保持超过60.0%的成功率。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结构化规划和任务挖掘实现了鲁棒且适应性强的GUI自动化，在复杂多步骤工作流中表现出色。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

Motivation: 临床数据集标注存在不确定性，传统聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性，影响模型评估的准确性。

Method: 提出使用概率指标来明确处理标注不确定性，这些指标可应用于不同标注生成过程，计算效率高。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试中，考虑二分类标签的置信度显著影响模型排名。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布原始标注数据并采用不确定性感知评估，使性能估计更准确反映临床数据特性。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Conclusion: 通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗领域提供更可靠有效的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in

TL;DR: 提出PD-SSM方法，通过结构化稀疏参数化状态空间模型的转移矩阵，在保持计算效率的同时实现最优表达能力，能够模拟任意有限状态自动机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代状态空间模型使用对角化转移矩阵虽然计算高效，但表达能力受限；而无结构转移矩阵虽然表达能力最优，但计算和内存成本过高。需要一种平衡计算效率和表达能力的方法。

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵(P)和复值对角矩阵(D)的乘积，使得并行扫描的计算成本与状态大小呈线性关系。

Result: 理论上模型BIBO稳定，能够用一层维度N模拟任意N状态FSA；实验上在FSA状态跟踪任务中优于多种现代SSM变体，在时间序列分类中性能与神经控制微分方程相当。

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持计算效率的同时实现了最优表达能力，能够有效跟踪复杂FSA状态，为状态空间模型提供了新的结构化参数化方法。

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

### [381] [Large Language Models as Nondeterministic Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22297)
*Sander Beckers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更简单的反事实生成方法，将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，适用于任何黑盒LLM，无需修改实现细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对LLM的解释存在歧义，要么没有字面解释LLM，要么没有按照意图解释LLM。本文旨在提供基于LLM预期语义的反事实推理理论基础。

Method: 将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，而不是确定性因果模型，从而生成反事实。这种方法对任何黑盒LLM都直接适用，不依赖实现细节。

Result: 提出了一个更简单且通用的反事实生成方法，能够直接应用于任何黑盒LLM，同时澄清了现有方法与新方法之间的关系。

Conclusion: 为基于LLM预期语义的反事实推理提供了理论基础，为开发面向特定应用的反事实生成方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

TL;DR: PRIME是一个多智能体推理框架，通过整合系统1（快速直觉思维）和系统2（缓慢审慎思维）来增强LLM的推理能力，使开源模型在复杂推理任务上达到与闭源模型竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知的双过程理论启发，旨在模拟人类思考过程，通过动态整合快速直觉思维和审慎推理来提升LLM在复杂知识密集型任务中的表现。

Method: 采用多智能体设计：首先使用快速思维智能体（系统1）生成初步答案，若检测到不确定性则触发系统2推理管道，包含规划、假设生成、检索、信息整合和决策等专门化智能体。

Result: 实验结果显示，PRIME使LLaMA 3等开源LLM在多跳和知识基础推理基准测试中，能够与GPT-4、GPT-4o等最先进闭源模型竞争。

Conclusion: PRIME为改进LLM在复杂知识密集型推理领域的表现提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，成功模拟了人类认知过程并提升了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注最终答案准确性，忽视了LLM搜索代理如何基于外部证据进行推理和行动，需要更细粒度的认知能力评估。

Method: 构建包含190个专家标注轨迹和1800多个响应步骤的SeekBench基准，通过证据标注进行细粒度分析，评估代理的推理基础、搜索适应性和证据充分性判断。

Result: 开发了首个专门评估LLM搜索代理认知能力的基准，提供了详细的步骤级分析框架。

Conclusion: SeekBench填补了LLM搜索代理认知能力评估的空白，为更全面地理解代理的推理和行为提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents
with reinforcement learning (RL) for open-domain question answering (QA).
However, most evaluations focus solely on final answer accuracy, overlooking
how these agents reason with and act on external evidence. We introduce
SeekBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the \textit{epistemic competence}
of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces.
SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps
generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for
granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in
observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from
low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess
whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

TL;DR: 提出了EMMA框架，结合生成数据引擎和训练管道，通过DreamTransfer生成多视角一致的机器人操作视频，并使用AdaMix训练策略提升VLA模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集大规模真实机器人操作数据成本高昂且耗时，需要解决数据稀缺问题以实现视觉-语言-动作模型的鲁棒泛化。

Method: 使用DreamTransfer框架进行文本控制的机器人视频视觉编辑，保持3D结构和几何合理性；采用AdaMix训练策略动态调整训练批次权重，专注于感知或运动学上的困难样本。

Result: DreamTransfer生成的视频在多视角一致性、几何保真度和文本条件准确性方面显著优于现有方法；在零样本视觉域的真实机器人操作任务中，相对仅使用真实数据的训练获得了200%以上的性能提升，结合AdaMix后进一步提升13%。

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过生成数据和混合训练策略有效提升了VLA模型的泛化能力，使机器人能够仅基于单一外观的演示泛化到未见过的物体类别和新视觉域。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASAL++ 在 ASAL 基础上引入多模态基础模型指导的开放式搜索，使用第二个基础模型根据模拟视觉历史提出新的进化目标，形成复杂度递增的进化轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型为人工生命模拟提供了强大的自动化搜索工具，但现有方法主要使用视觉语言模型将模拟与自然语言目标提示对齐。ASAL++ 旨在实现更具开放式特征的搜索。

Method: 提出两种策略：EST（每次迭代进化模拟以匹配单个新提示）和 ETT（进化模拟以匹配所有生成提示的序列）。在 Lenia 底物中使用 Gemma-3 提出进化目标。

Result: 实验表明 EST 促进更大的视觉新颖性，而 ETT 培养更连贯和可解释的进化序列。

Conclusion: ASAL++ 为基础模型驱动的人工生命发现指出了具有开放式特征的新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoSketch是一个神经符号框架，将几何推理转化为交互式的感知-推理-行动循环，通过结构化逻辑表示、符号推理和可执行草图操作来动态解决几何问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型将图表视为静态图像，缺乏动态操作能力，而人类几何推理需要辅助线构造和仿射变换等动态操作。

Method: 集成三个模块：感知模块将图表抽象为结构化逻辑形式；符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一步推理；草图行动模块执行绘制辅助线或应用变换等操作，形成闭环。采用两阶段训练：监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 在GeoSketch基准测试上，相比静态感知方法，GeoSketch显著提高了逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率。

Conclusion: GeoSketch通过统一分层决策、可执行视觉动作和符号验证，将多模态推理从静态解释推进到动态可验证交互，为复杂视觉空间问题解决建立了新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

Motivation: 传统LLM智能体开发需要精心设计工作流、提示词和迭代调优，依赖专业知识和LLM技术，这种手工限制阻碍了智能体在各行业的可扩展性和成本效益。

Method: 提出金字塔式DAG多智能体框架，包含：智能体即工具机制自动分解复杂任务、双审计机制保证质量、智能体路由实现任务匹配、自进化机制自主重构DAG结构，以及支持并行的原子任务设计。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，InfiAgent比类似的自生成智能体框架ADAS性能提升9.9%；案例研究显示AI研究助手InfiHelper生成的科研论文获得了IEEE顶级会议人类评审的认可。

Conclusion: InfiAgent框架能够演化成通用的金字塔式多智能体系统，解决广泛的问题，显著提升了LLM智能体的可扩展性和执行效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准评估成本高且需要人工设计任务，需要一种可扩展的开放评估方法来评估语言模型智能体的能力。

Method: 提出EELMA算法，通过多轮文本交互近似估计赋能，并在语言游戏和网页浏览场景中验证。

Result: 赋能与平均任务表现强相关，能表征环境复杂性、思维链、模型规模和记忆长度等因素的影响，高赋能状态往往是关键能力时刻。

Conclusion: 赋能是评估复杂开放环境中语言模型智能体的有吸引力的通用指标。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型如何进行复杂推理及其失败机制是解释性研究的挑战，需要提供可测量的几何分析视角。

Method: 定义Reasoning Manifold概念，构建REMA框架，通过计算错误表示与正确表示形成的流形之间的k近邻距离来量化几何偏差，并跟踪模型各层的偏差变化来定位推理偏离点。

Result: 实验证明推理流形的低维特性，错误与正确推理表示的高度可分性，验证了REMA框架在分析推理失败起源方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究将抽象推理失败与表示中的可测量几何偏差联系起来，为深入理解和诊断黑盒模型的内部计算过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在社会模拟中存在两种不同的社会倾向："适应性利己主义者"和"利他优化者"，揭示了不同LLM在利己与利他倾向上的内在异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作行为，忽略了大规模智能体社会中利他主义的涌现机制，需要理解LLM智能体所体现的社会逻辑。

Method: 引入Schelling变体城市迁移模型，创建社会困境，让200多个LLM智能体在利己和利他目标间进行选择，并使用扎根理论启发的方法系统编码智能体推理。

Result: 识别出两种原型：适应性利己主义者默认优先考虑自身利益但在社会规范影响下利他行为显著增加；利他优化者表现出内在利他逻辑，即使牺牲自身利益也优先考虑集体利益。

Conclusion: 社会模拟中的模型选择不仅是选择推理能力，更是选择内在的社会行动逻辑。适应性利己主义者更适合模拟复杂人类社会，利他优化者更适合模拟理想化亲社会行为者。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

TL;DR: StepORLM是一个自演化的框架，通过生成式过程监督解决大语言模型在运筹学问题中的训练挑战，采用策略模型和生成过程奖励模型的协同进化循环，在六个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的LLM训练方法存在两个关键局限：结果奖励存在信用分配问题，正确最终答案可能强化错误推理；传统判别式过程监督短视，无法全面评估运筹学建模的相互依赖步骤。

Method: StepORLM采用协同进化循环，策略模型和生成过程奖励模型相互迭代改进，通过双重反馈机制：来自外部求解器的确定性结果验证和来自GenPRM的细致全面过程评估，结合加权直接偏好优化对齐策略模型并同时优化GenPRM。

Result: 8B参数的StepORLM在六个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于更大规模的通用模型、代理方法和专业基线。协同进化的GenPRM能够作为强大且普遍适用的过程验证器，大幅提升自身模型和其他现有LLM的推理扩展性能。

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和协同进化框架有效解决了运筹学问题中LLM训练的信用分配和过程评估问题，证明了该方法在提升模型性能和泛化能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编解码器仍针对单模态单向通信优化，在传统的压缩-传输-重建流程中会导致重复的质量下降，无法满足人机双向多模态交互的需求。

Method: 采用紧凑token化表示作为通信媒介，使用轻量级Transformer熵模型（通用、掩码和文本条件三种设计）来最小化token间冗余。

Conclusion: UniMIC为下一代多模态交互通信提供了一个实用且前瞻的范式。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中，发现改变激活专家数量可以产生互补的解决方案集，这揭示了新的多样性来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：动态MoE（在推理时直接控制专家数量生成多样化推理轨迹）和专家配置继承（在推理路径内保持一致的专家数量，在不同运行间变化）。

Result: 在多个MoE架构、验证器和推理基准（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线，在不增加额外成本的情况下提高了准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES作为一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS方法，展示了现代LLM中结构灵活性如何推进推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文通过图抽象分析强化学习在LLM规划中的理论机制，发现SFT会引入伪相关解，而RL通过探索实现正确规划，但PG存在多样性崩溃问题，Q-learning则能保持多样性并避免奖励黑客。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法显著提升了LLMs的规划能力，但其有效性缺乏理论解释，需要系统分析RL在规划任务中的优势和局限。

Method: 采用基于图的抽象模型，分析策略梯度(PG)和Q-learning方法，并在Blocksworld基准上进行实证验证。

Result: SFT产生基于共现的伪解，RL通过探索实现泛化；PG训练中输出多样性下降且持续存在，Q-learning能保持多样性并避免奖励黑客。

Conclusion: 探索是RL规划成功的关键，Q-learning在保持多样性和避免奖励黑客方面优于PG，但需要精心设计奖励函数。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.
