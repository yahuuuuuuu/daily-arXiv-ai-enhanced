### [1] [GAZE:Governance-Aware pre-annotation for Zero-shot World Model Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14992)
*Leela Krishna,Mengyang Zhao,Saicharithreddy Pasula,Harshit Rajgarhia,Abhishek Mukherji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE pipeline自动化将原始长视频转换为高质量的世界模型训练数据，通过多模态预标注和结构化输出，显著提升标注效率和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动标注大规模多模态数据集成本高、效率低，需要自动化解决方案来支持世界模型的训练。

Method: 采用三步流程：标准化360度视频格式、应用AI模型进行多模态预标注、整合信号为结构化输出供人工验证。

Result: 节省每审核小时约19分钟，减少80%以上人工审核量，生成高保真、隐私感知的数据集。

Conclusion: GAZE提供了一个可扩展的蓝图，在不牺牲吞吐量或治理的情况下生成高质量世界模型训练数据。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [2] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PC-UNet模型和PVMC-Loss损失函数，通过整合物理数据来改善PET图像质量，解决低剂量PET图像中的泊松噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET成像在医学中很重要，但高剂量会增加辐射暴露，降低剂量会引入泊松噪声，现有去噪方法无法有效处理这种噪声，导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 开发了Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet)模型，提出新的Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss)，该损失函数整合物理数据，在方差和梯度适应方面具有统计无偏性。

Result: 在PET数据集上的测试表明，PC-UNet提高了物理一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: PC-UNet能够有效整合物理信息，改善PET图像质量，证明其在处理低剂量PET图像中的有效性。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过直接干预模型的注意力图来缓解文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型容易受到语义泄漏的影响，即不同实体之间语义相关特征的意外传递。现有的缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入。

Method: DeLeaker在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时加强每个实体的身份特征。

Result: 实验表明DeLeaker在所有基线方法中表现最佳，即使基线方法提供了外部信息，DeLeaker也能在不影响保真度或质量的情况下有效缓解泄漏。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了注意力控制的价值，为开发更语义精确的文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到仿真系统，可将众包城市游览视频转换为物理感知的交互式仿真场景，包含10万+标注城市3D资产库和自动生成流水线，在导航任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工制作或程序生成的仿真场景缺乏可扩展性或无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性，而城市具身AI代理需要多样化、高保真的城市环境进行训练。

Method: UrbanVerse包含UrbanVerse-100K（10万+标注城市3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频提取场景布局并使用检索资产实例化度量尺度3D仿真的自动流水线），在IsaacSim中运行。

Result: UrbanVerse构建了来自24个国家的160个高质量场景，保持真实世界语义和布局，人类评估的真实感与人工制作场景相当。在导航任务中，训练策略表现出缩放幂律和强泛化能力，仿真中成功率提高+6.3%，零样本仿真到真实迁移中提高+30.1%。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse通过数据驱动方法成功解决了城市仿真场景的可扩展性和真实性问题，为城市具身AI代理训练提供了有效的解决方案，在真实世界任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练的3D物体编辑框架，通过FlowEdit和TRELLIS实现局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge策略保持结构一致性，创建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前3D编辑方法效率低下、不一致且难以保持未编辑区域的问题，避免基于多视图渲染重建带来的伪影和实用性限制。

Method: 将FlowEdit集成到TRELLIS中，通过前视图渲染指导局部编辑，并引入区域感知合并策略Voxel/Slat-Merge，自适应保持结构保真度。

Result: 实验表明Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，并构建了包含10万+高质量3D编辑对的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了算法设计和数据可用性方面的长期挑战，显著提高了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ECHO框架，通过社交媒体帖子构建图像生成基准测试，发现现有基准测试未覆盖的新兴用例，并基于真实用户反馈设计质量评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成基准测试滞后于实际应用发展，无法捕捉新兴用例，导致社区认知与正式评估之间存在差距。

Method: 从展示新颖提示和定性用户判断的社交媒体帖子中构建数据集，收集了超过31,000个提示，并基于社区反馈设计质量评估指标。

Result: ECHO框架发现了现有基准测试中缺失的创意复杂任务，能更好地区分最先进模型与替代方案，并基于用户反馈设计了颜色、身份和结构变化的评估指标。

Conclusion: ECHO框架通过真实世界证据构建基准测试，能更准确地反映图像生成模型的实际能力和用户需求，为模型评估提供了更贴近实际应用的视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的子模框架来解决从海量LoRA适配器中选择最相关和多样化模型的问题，通过组合优化方法生成跨领域的多样化输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Civit.ai等平台上有超过10万个LoRA适配器，但由于数量庞大、多样性高且缺乏结构化组织，用户在选择和有效使用最适合的适配器时面临挑战。

Method: 将LoRA模型选择任务构建为组合优化问题，并提出新颖的子模框架来解决这个问题。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法能够在广泛领域内生成多样化的输出。

Conclusion: 提出的子模框架有效解决了从大规模LoRA适配器数据库中选择相关且多样化模型的问题，为个性化内容生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [8] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一个用于通用实例分割的基础模型家族，通过瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导不确定性校准损失和统一训练策略，在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持最先进性能，支持从高端加速器到移动硬件的帕累托最优部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在实例级感知方面取得了突破，但高计算成本限制了在资源受限平台上的部署。需要设计能够在边缘设备上高效部署而不牺牲性能的架构。

Method: 1. 瓶颈像素解码器用于高效多尺度和多模态融合
2. 语言引导不确定性校准损失用于自适应解码器剪枝
3. 简化的统一训练策略

Result: MOBIUS在仅三分之一训练迭代次数下，减少像素FLOPs达55%，变换器解码器FLOPs达75%，同时保持最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: MOBIUS为高性能计算平台和移动设备上的高效分割设立了新基准，实现了帕累托最优的向下扩展部署。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COGS是一个数据高效框架，通过分解种子问题为基本感知和推理因子，然后系统性地重新组合生成大量合成问答对，从而为多模态大语言模型提供高级推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练多模态大语言模型在多样化任务上表现强劲，但在标注数据难以收集的领域推理能力有限，特别是图表、渲染文档和网页等人工图像领域。

Method: 将每个种子问题分解为基本感知和推理因子，然后系统性地与新的图像重新组合生成大量合成问答对，每个生成的问题都配有子问题和中间答案，支持因子级过程奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在图表推理实验中，COGS显著提高了对未见问题的性能，在推理密集和组合问题上收益最大。使用不同种子数据的因子级混合训练在多个数据集上实现了更好的迁移效果。

Conclusion: COGS框架能够诱导出可泛化的能力而非数据集特定的过拟合，并且可以扩展到图表以外的其他领域如网页。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

*Yichen Li,Zhiyi Li,Brandon Feng,Dinghuai Zhang,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen是一个从势能角度统一刚体、铰接体和软体动力学的框架，通过引入方向刚度来捕捉广泛的物理行为，为创建交互式虚拟环境和训练机器人代理提供通用基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生世界为在可扫描环境中开发通用具身智能体提供了新机会，需要统一的物理动力学框架来处理复杂的物理行为。

Method: 从势能角度出发，将世界视为整体实体，通过运动观测推断物理属性；扩展经典弹性动力学，引入方向刚度；使用专门网络建模扩展材料属性，采用神经场以几何无关方式表示变形。

Result: 大量实验证明GDGen能够稳健地统一多种仿真范式，为创建交互式虚拟环境和在复杂动态场景中训练机器人代理提供通用基础。

Conclusion: GDGen通过势能视角成功统一了多种物理动力学系统，为数字孪生世界中的通用具身智能体开发提供了有效的框架。

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出COLIPRI编码器家族，通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练，缓解3D医学图像领域数据不足的问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学图像领域的数据稀缺限制了当前视觉-语言编码器的能力，需要解决数据不足的问题。

Method: 引入报告生成目标，将视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练相结合，利用图像-文本配对数据和纯图像数据，采用3D医学影像领域的最佳实践。

Result: COLIPRI编码器在报告生成、分类探测和零样本分类任务上达到最先进性能，在语义分割任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过额外的归纳偏置和数据增强策略，可以有效提升3D医学图像视觉-语言编码器的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出DRIFT方法，通过梯度空间中的推理知识转移来提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免资源密集的训练方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的推理能力落后于纯文本模型，现有方法需要大量资源，而简单的模型合并方法效果不稳定

Method: DRIFT方法：预计算推理先验作为参数空间差异，在微调过程中用其偏置梯度，保持多模态对齐的同时转移推理知识

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse等基准测试中，DRIFT持续优于简单合并和监督微调，以较低成本达到或超过资源密集型方法

Conclusion: DRIFT提供了一种轻量级且有效的多模态推理能力提升方案，在保持多模态对齐的同时高效转移推理知识

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

### [13] [A solution to generalized learning from small training sets found in everyday infant experiences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15060)
*Frangil Ramirez,Elizabeth Clerkin,David J. Crandall,Linda B. Smith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 婴儿日常视觉体验的统计特性（相似图像簇与罕见多变图像交替出现）支持早期类别学习和泛化，这种"块状"结构能提高机器学习中从小数据集的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决婴儿如何从有限经验中实现强大泛化能力的矛盾，探索早期基本水平对象类别的形成机制。

Method: 分析14名7-11个月婴儿的自我中心视角图像，计算八种早期学习类别的视觉相似性结构，并进行机器学习模拟实验。

Result: 婴儿日常视觉输入呈现"块状"相似结构，高度相似图像簇与罕见多变图像交替出现；机器学习实验表明模仿这种结构能提高小数据集的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 婴儿自然体验的块状结构可能支持早期类别学习，并为各种问题和学习者的高效学习提供原则。

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaLon3R是一个结构感知的长时3D高斯泼溅重建框架，通过引入紧凑锚点基元和3D点Transformer，在单次前向传播中消除冗余并解决几何不一致性，实现超过50视图的实时重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法在长时视频序列中预测逐像素高斯并组合所有视图，导致大量冗余和几何不一致问题，需要更高效的在线重建方法。

Method: 使用3D重建骨干网络预测逐像素高斯和几何复杂度显著性图，通过可微分显著性感知高斯量化将冗余高斯压缩为紧凑锚点，利用3D点Transformer学习空间结构先验来优化锚点属性和显著性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进的性能，能够重建超过50个视图，帧率超过10FPS，冗余减少50%到90%，在新型视图合成和深度估计任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: SaLon3R无需已知相机参数或测试时优化，在单次前向传播中有效解决伪影并修剪冗余3DGS，展示了长时通用3D重建的优越效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: 提出了Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT)框架，通过轨迹和局部文本描述来控制视频生成，解决了多对象场景下传统方法的精度不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在控制场景中多个对象的位置和运动方面存在局限，特别是在复杂多对象设置下，传统基于边界框或分割掩码的方法精度不足且缺乏清晰的实体-轨迹对应关系。

Method: 提出TGT框架，包含Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA)来整合轨迹和文本信号，采用双CFG方案分别调制局部和全局文本引导，并开发了数据处理流程来生成带有跟踪实体局部描述的轨迹。

Result: TGT在视觉质量、文本对齐精度和运动可控性方面均优于现有方法，能够使用点轨迹作为直观的运动控制手柄，同时控制外观和运动。

Conclusion: TGT框架通过轨迹与文本的配对，显著提升了视频生成中对多个对象的精确控制能力，为复杂场景的视频生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

Method: 使用在多样化脑MRI数据上训练的基于分数的扩散先验，结合灵活的前向模型来处理超分辨率、偏置场校正、修复等常见图像处理任务。

Result: 在异质临床和研究MRI数据上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，产生一致、高质量的解决方案，且无需配对训练数据集。

Conclusion: 扩散先验作为脑MRI分析的多功能工具具有巨大潜力，能够提高解剖保真度并改进现有深度学习方法输出。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: 提出FFT-MIL框架，通过频域分支增强多实例学习，在WSI分类中捕获全局依赖关系，提高诊断预测准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WSI分类方法难以捕获全局依赖关系，限制了粗粒度结构的建模能力，影响诊断预测的鲁棒性

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换从WSI中提取低频分量，通过FFT-Block处理频域数据，并与空间补丁特征融合

Result: 在三个公开数据集上评估，集成FFT-Block使宏F1分数平均提高3.51%，AUC提高1.51%

Conclusion: 频域学习是捕获WSI分类中全局依赖关系的有效机制，可增强MIL在计算病理学中的可扩展性和准确性

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估通用跨模态问答能力，但无法确定全模态大语言模型是否真正实现了模态不变推理，还是存在模态特定偏见。

Method: 构建包含60,828个多选题的XModBench基准，涵盖五个任务家族和所有六种模态组合，系统评估模型的模态不变推理能力、模态差异和方向不平衡。

Result: 实验显示最强模型Gemini 2.5 Pro在空间时间推理上准确率低于60%；存在持续模态差异，音频模态表现显著低于文本模态；存在系统性方向不平衡，视觉作为上下文时一致性低于文本。

Conclusion: 当前全模态大语言模型远未实现真正的模态不变推理，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基础诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据的混合预训练中，高质量数据筛选方法研究不足，需要有效的数据质量评估机制。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成不同质量等级的文本，创建样本-评分对来训练UniFilter分类器，然后应用于DataComp和OBELICS数据集的筛选。

Result: 使用UniFilter筛选的数据预训练的MLLMs在零样本推理和上下文学习能力上显著提升，经过视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更好。

Conclusion: UniFilter方法能有效提升多模态预训练数据质量，带来下游任务性能的显著改善，相关数据和模型已开源供社区使用。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

TL;DR: 该研究通过训练CLIP模型并系统评估超参数和数据增强策略，揭示了计算病理学中可重复性的关键因素，发现适度的RandomResizedCrop设置(0.7-0.8)、分布式训练和适当学习率对模型性能稳定性至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型训练在病理学中的可重复性挑战，包括软件随机性、硬件非确定性和超参数报告不一致等问题。

Method: 在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估不同超参数设置和数据增强策略在三个下游病理学数据集(PatchCamelyon、LC25000-Lung、LC25000-Colon)上的影响。

Result: 发现RandomResizedCrop值0.7-0.8优于更激进(0.6)或保守(0.9)的设置；分布式训练无局部损失提高了稳定性；学习率低于5.0e-5在所有数据集上性能下降；LC25000(Colon)数据集提供最可重复的基准。

Conclusion: 计算病理学中的可重复性不仅依赖于透明文档，还需要精心选择的实验配置，研究为开发可重复的数字病理学基础模型提供了实用指导规则。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Motivation: 现有生成数据增强方法难以平衡保真度和多样性，因为合成过程中的表示往往与非必要的输入图像属性（如环境上下文）纠缠，与修改这些元素的文本提示产生冲突。

Method: 使用显著概念感知图像嵌入模型来减少合成过程中不相关视觉细节的影响，保持图像和文本输入之间的直观对齐，生成更好保留类别判别特征并具有额外受控变化的图像。

Result: 在八个细粒度视觉数据集上表现出优越性能，在常规和长尾设置下分别比最先进的数据增强方法平均分类准确率提高0.73%和6.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过生成保留类别判别特征并增强多样性的图像，有效提高了下游模型的鲁棒性，在细粒度视觉任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

Conclusion: DriveGen3D成功填补了方法学空白，通过多模态条件控制将加速长期视频生成与大规模动态场景重建相结合，为高质量可控动态3D驾驶场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于单正多标签学习的双曲几何分类框架，将标签表示为双曲球而非点或向量，通过几何球交互建模丰富的标签关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过基于距离的相似性隐式建模标签关系，缺乏对不同关系类型的显式几何定义，难以捕捉复杂的标签关系和层次结构。

Method: 使用双曲球表示标签，通过球的包含、重叠和分离关系自然建模层次结构、共现模式和语义独立性；引入温度自适应双曲球分类器和物理启发的双井正则化。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式，能够有效建模复杂的标签关系。

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

TL;DR: SVG是一种新型的潜在扩散模型，不使用变分自编码器，而是利用自监督表示进行视觉生成，通过冻结的DINO特征构建具有清晰语义区分度的特征空间，实现更高效的扩散训练和生成质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VAE+扩散模型存在训练效率低、推理速度慢、向更广泛视觉任务迁移性差的问题，这些问题源于VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰的语义分离和强判别结构。

Method: SVG利用冻结的DINO特征构建具有语义区分度的特征空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕捉细粒度细节以实现高保真重建，直接在语义结构化的潜在空间上训练扩散模型。

Result: SVG实现了加速扩散训练、支持少步采样、提高生成质量，并保留了底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力。

Conclusion: SVG为任务通用、高质量的视觉表示提供了一条原则性路径，解决了传统VAE+扩散模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

TL;DR: CoMe是一个渐进式结构化剪枝框架，通过基于拼接的层融合技术和分层蒸馏后训练过程，有效减少大语言模型的参数规模，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能优异，但巨大的规模带来了高计算和存储需求。现有结构化剪枝方法往往忽略保留被剪枝部分的能力，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 提出渐进式层剪枝框架，包括：1）使用激活强度和权重范数的通道敏感度指标进行细粒度通道选择；2）基于拼接的层融合方法融合相邻层的关键通道；3）分层蒸馏协议利用原始模型与剪枝模型层之间的对应关系进行知识迁移。

Result: 在7个基准测试上，CoMe达到最先进性能。当剪枝LLaMA-2-7b的30%参数时，剪枝模型保持原始模型平均准确率的83%。

Conclusion: CoMe框架通过渐进式剪枝、层融合和分层蒸馏，有效解决了结构化剪枝中的性能下降问题，为大语言模型压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MPI-Lab/CoMe.

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial457数据集来评估多模态模型在6D空间推理能力，发现现有模型在复杂3D空间任务上表现不佳，并引入了相对性能下降率(RPDR)来量化这些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注2D空间理解，缺乏全面评估6D空间推理能力的框架，因此需要开发新的评估数据集和方法。

Method: 创建了Spatial457合成数据集，包含4个关键空间推理能力：多目标识别、2D位置、3D位置和3D方向，采用级联评估结构构建了7种问题类型和5个难度级别。

Result: 评估显示多模态模型在任务复杂度增加时性能普遍下降，特别是在3D推理和6D空间任务中，并发现了不同属性间的预测偏差。

Conclusion: 多模态模型在复杂3D空间推理方面存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进，Spatial457数据集为评估这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过原型学习和多数据集联合训练，成功解决了面部关键点检测中的数据集差异问题，实现了统一的检测框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人体运动重建方法在将人体准确放置在3D空间中存在困难，而真实的人物与环境交互对于游戏、AR/VR和机器人应用至关重要。

Method: SHARE首先估计每帧的人体网格和分割掩码，以及关键帧的场景点云图。通过迭代比较人体网格与使用掩码从场景中提取的人体点云图，优化关键帧中的人体位置，并保持非关键帧人体网格相对于关键帧根关节位置的一致性。

Result: 该方法能够在重建周围场景的同时实现更准确的3D人体定位，在精选数据集和野外网络视频上都表现出色。

Conclusion: 大量实验表明，SHARE在人体运动重建方面优于现有方法，为各种应用提供了更准确的人体定位能力。

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: 脑电和皮层脑电信号在运动想象分类中存在生理伪影干扰，现有Transformer方法难以捕捉细粒度依赖关系。

Method: 扩展深度状态空间模型，整合捕捉脑电信号的时域、空域和频域依赖关系。

Result: 在三个基准测试中（两个大规模公共EEG数据集和一个临床ECoG数据集）均优于基线方法，并有效识别神经生理相关区域。

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM能够有效捕捉脑电信号的跨域依赖，在运动想象分类中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Motivation: 微创手术中的自动化工具检测需求迫切，但手术场景中标注数据有限，需要开发更高效的深度学习训练方法。

Method: 两阶段自适应微调：线性探测阶段在预训练CNN上调整分类层，渐进冻结阶段动态减少可微调层数，降低网络复杂度。

Result: 在Cholec80数据集上达到96.4% mAP，优于现有方法和传统微调技术，并在眼科手术数据集CATARACTS上验证了通用性。

Conclusion: 渐进冻结微调是改进手术工具检测的有效技术，在多样化手术程序中具有应用潜力，并可扩展到通用图像分类任务。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FreqPDE方法能够有效提升多视图2D图像的3D物体检测性能，无需LiDAR监督，解决了深度预测质量问题和跨视图一致性等挑战。

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕获，导致重建不完整，无法恢复被遮挡或自遮挡区域。

Method: 提出姿态感知融合策略，结合全局和局部配准，将辅助姿态图像迭代融合到主姿态的统一3DGS表示中，并智能整合3D基础模型进行配准。

Result: 实验结果表明PFGS在定性和定量评估中均优于强基线方法，产生更完整的重建和更高保真度的3DGS模型。

Conclusion: PFGS通过多姿态融合有效解决了3DGS重建不完整的问题，为实际应用中的物体重建提供了更完整的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Conclusion: LILAC成功将高性能离线运动风格化框架扩展到在线设置，为需要连续响应角色控制的应用提供了有效的实时解决方案。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

*Shuang Liang,Zhihao Xu,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue,Xiting Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LoD框架，通过任务特定学习而非攻击特定学习来检测未知的越狱攻击，包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块和无监督攻击分类模块，在多样未知攻击上实现更高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型仍易受越狱攻击威胁，现有检测方法要么学习攻击特定参数导致泛化性差，要么依赖启发式原则限制准确性和效率。

Method: 提出学习检测框架，包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块进行安全导向表示学习，以及安全模式自编码器模块进行无监督攻击分类。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在多样未知攻击上实现一致的更高检测AUROC，同时提高了效率。

Conclusion: LoD框架通过从攻击特定学习转向任务特定学习，能够准确检测未知越狱攻击，提供更好的泛化性和效率。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic4Safety框架，使用零样本语义分割从街景图像提取11个可解释的街景指标，结合道路类型分析交通事故数据，通过XGBoost分类器和SHAP解释特征贡献，并应用GPS加权和ATE估计量化因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景图像分析中的两个基本挑战：(1)如何构建捕捉事故相关特征的街道级指标，(2)如何量化这些指标对不同事故类型的因果影响。

Method: 使用零样本语义分割从街景图像提取11个可解释街景指标，结合道路类型分析约30,000起事故记录。训练XGBoost多类分类器，使用SHAP解释特征贡献，应用GPS加权和ATE估计控制混杂因素。

Result: 发现异质性的、事故类型特定的因果模式：场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何特征主导预测能力；更大的可驾驶区域和紧急空间降低风险，而过度视觉开放性可能增加风险。

Conclusion: 通过将预测建模与因果推断相结合，Semantic4Safety支持有针对性的干预措施和高风险走廊诊断，为城市道路安全规划提供了可扩展的数据驱动工具。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Predictive-Corrective (PC)范式，通过解耦建模任务来加速学习。PCMambaNet包含预测先验模块和校正残差网络，在脑MRI分割中仅需1-5个epoch即可达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端深度学习方法收敛慢、依赖大规模数据集的问题，特别是在数据稀缺的医学影像领域提高学习效率。

Method: PC范式将建模任务解耦：预测先验模块利用解剖学知识（双侧对称性）生成粗略近似；校正残差网络学习残差误差，专注于精炼挑战性区域。

Result: 在高分辨率脑MRI分割实验中，PCMambaNet达到最先进精度，且仅在1-5个epoch内收敛，传统端到端模型无法实现此性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式融入领域知识简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解了数据效率低下和过拟合问题，实现了显著加速。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

TL;DR: 提出了证据优先的自适应框架EARL，通过强化学习让模型主动选择关键帧并进行局部重采样，在多个视频推理基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频推理中的信息稀释问题，现有方法缺乏严格的奖励机制来保证证据纯度，且无法在预采样帧之外进行时间信息补充。

Method: 基于"少选多推理"理念的证据感知强化学习框架，动态选择最相关帧并对关键帧进行局部重采样以获取细粒度时间细节。

Result: 在五个视频推理基准测试中达到开源Video LLMs的新SOTA，7B模型在LongVideoBench、MVBench和VideoMME上分别达到59.8%、69.0%和64.9%。

Conclusion: 证据纯度的优先考虑和所提框架的有效性得到验证，强化了主动证据选择策略的重要性。

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: MAVR-Net是一个基于多视角学习的微型飞行器动作识别框架，通过结合RGB帧、光流和分割掩码三种互补数据类型，显著提升了MAV运动识别的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉微型飞行器复杂的时空运动特征，限制了区分不同动作的能力。

Method: 使用ResNet编码器从三个视角提取特征，采用多尺度特征金字塔保留时空细节，引入跨视角注意力模块建模模态依赖关系，并设计多视角对齐损失确保语义一致性。

Result: 在基准MAV动作数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在Short MAV、Medium MAV和Long MAV数据集上分别达到97.8%、96.5%和92.8%的准确率，明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAVR-Net通过多视角学习和跨模态交互，有效解决了MAV运动识别中的挑战，为自主空中蜂群的协同感知和控制提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTrack是一种基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器，通过将目标属性特征编码到包含细粒度线索的方向性核中，生成精确的提示来改善夜间跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，无法提供指向目标特征的细粒度线索，导致生成模糊提示，影响跟踪器准确聚焦目标特征的能力。

Method: 受视觉仿生学启发，DPTrack首先分层捕获目标的拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示；然后编码器将这些拓扑感知特征压缩到方向性核中；最后基于通道-类别对应关系的核引导提示模块在搜索区域特征中传播核以精确定位目标特征位置，并将其转换为精确提示。

Result: 在现有基准测试上的广泛评估表明DPTrack具有优越的性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过编码目标属性特征到方向性核中生成精确提示，有效解决了夜间航拍跟踪中提示模糊的问题，实现了鲁棒的夜间跟踪。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，现有方法主要依赖简单空间增强而忽视时间增强策略，限制了运动模式的多样性捕捉。

Method: 将每个微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动相位，为每个相位生成独立的动态图像，形成双相位动态图像增强策略。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别准确率、未加权F1分数和未加权平均召回率方面均有显著提升，结合空间增强可获得高达10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关且在低资源设置下有效，为鲁棒和可泛化的微表情识别提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

Motivation: 传统SfM方法在应用于多相机系统捕获的驾驶场景时存在相机姿态估计不可靠、路面重建异常值过多和重建效率低等问题，需要专门针对驾驶场景的解决方案。

Method: 利用多相机系统的固定空间关系提高姿态估计可靠性；采用平面模型去除三角化路面中的错误点；将多相机系统作为单一单元进行束调整以减少优化变量；通过场景关联和组装模块实现多场景聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实现了0.124的绝对姿态误差，表现出最先进的性能；在实际车辆部署中验证了框架在各种场景下的泛化能力和在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MRASfM框架有效解决了驾驶场景中多相机SfM的关键问题，在姿态估计精度、重建质量和效率方面都取得了显著改进，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal

a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature
representation. COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis, improving
MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Conclusion: HiMA架构通过有效结合Transformer和Mamba模块，配合LoDA和MPF技术，成功实现了高效且高质量的低光RAW图像增强

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

### [54] [Latent Feature Alignment: Discovering Biased and Interpretable Subpopulations in Face Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15520)
*Ignacio Serna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Latent Feature Alignment (LFA)方法，无需属性标签即可识别人脸识别模型中的偏差子群体，通过潜在方向实现语义一致的分组和可解释方向发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型虽然整体准确率高，但仍存在系统性偏差，传统偏差评估框架依赖昂贵且有限的预定义属性标签。

Method: 使用潜在方向识别子群体的无属性标签算法，相比标准聚类方法能实现语义一致的分组和可解释方向发现。

Result: 在四种最先进识别模型和两个基准测试上，LFA在组内语义一致性方面持续优于k-means和最近邻搜索，并发现与人口统计和上下文属性对齐的可解释潜在方向。

Conclusion: LFA作为人脸识别模型表示审计的实用方法，使从业者能够在无需预定义属性注释的情况下识别和解释偏差子群体。

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

*Aditya Vir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于卫星土地利用分类的自定义卷积神经网络架构，在EuroSAT数据集上实现了97.23%的测试准确率，无需预训练模型。通过三个渐进式架构迭代，开发了平衡多任务注意力机制，结合空间和光谱特征提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星图像分类中的特定失败模式，探索无需预训练模型的高性能分类方法，验证系统化架构设计在领域特定应用中的有效性。

Method: 采用三个渐进式架构迭代：基线架构、CBAM增强架构和平衡多任务注意力架构。平衡多任务注意力机制结合坐标注意力（空间特征）和挤压激励块（光谱特征），通过可学习融合参数统一。使用渐进DropBlock正则化和类别平衡损失加权。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上达到97.23%测试准确率，Cohen's Kappa为0.9692，所有类别准确率超过94.46%。可学习融合参数自主收敛到约0.57，表明空间和光谱模态重要性相近。性能接近微调ResNet-50（98.57%），仅差1.34%。

Conclusion: 系统化架构设计在卫星图像分类中非常有效，无需外部数据即可达到接近预训练模型的性能。平衡多任务注意力机制成功解决了空间和光谱特征的融合问题。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

TL;DR: SiM2P是一个基于3D扩散桥的框架，能够从MRI和患者辅助信息生成诊断质量的FDG-PET模拟图像，显著提高了痴呆症诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中具有重要作用，但相比常规MRI，其可及性差且成本高。研究旨在开发一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用3D扩散桥框架学习从MRI和患者信息到FDG-PET图像的概率映射，生成模拟PET图像。

Result: 在盲法临床研究中，SiM2P将三组（阿尔茨海默病、行为变异型额颞叶痴呆、认知健康对照）的总体诊断准确率从75.0%提高到84.7%，且模拟PET图像获得更高的诊断确定性和评估者间一致性。

Conclusion: SiM2P框架使FDG-PET的诊断优势更易获得，仅需20例特定病例和基本人口统计学信息即可本地部署，有望改善资源有限环境下的早期检测和鉴别诊断。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史文档分析中结构化内容在退化、非标准形式下出现的挑战，包括运动模糊、手写变化、曝光波动和杂乱背景等问题。

Method: 从127个二战时期档案视频片段中提取拍板文本，提供全帧标注和裁剪词图像，使用旋转边界框作为4点多边形表示，支持空间精确的OCR应用。

Result: 在零样本和微调条件下评估了6个识别模型和7个检测模型，尽管训练集较小（18个视频），微调仍带来显著性能提升，适合少样本学习场景。

Conclusion: ClapperText为低资源档案环境中的鲁棒OCR和文档理解提供了现实且文化基础的数据资源，数据集和评估代码已公开。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成艺术性和连贯的3D场景布局，在数字内容创作中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视角架构来增强DeepFake检测，通过全局、中观和局部三个专门编码器分析面部特征，并加入面部朝向编码器来处理不同视角，在挑战性数据集上优于传统单视角方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DeepFake检测方法在真实世界条件下难以应对姿态变化、遮挡和难以检测的伪影，需要更鲁棒的检测方案。

Method: 集成三个专门编码器：全局视角编码器检测边界不一致性，中观视角编码器分析纹理和颜色对齐，局部视角编码器捕捉眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴等表达性面部区域的扭曲。还加入了面部朝向编码器来分类面部姿态。

Result: 在挑战性数据集上的实验结果表明该方法有效，优于传统的单视角方法，即使在挑战性的姿态和光照条件下也能实现优越的检测性能。

Conclusion: 多视角架构通过融合不同层次的面部特征分析，显著提升了DeepFake检测的鲁棒性和准确性，特别是在处理姿态变化和复杂场景时表现优异。

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Motivation: 解决荧光显微镜中未配对数据集的模态转换问题，同时减少计算成本和环境影响，并为实验质量提供诊断工具。

Method: 用固定通道方法替代U-Net生成器中的传统通道倍增策略，大幅减少可训练参数。将GAN作为诊断工具，通过比较生成输出与实验图像检测质量问题。

Result: 参数从4180万减少到约9000个，性能更优，训练更快，内存使用更低。GAN能有效检测光漂白、伪影和标记不准确等问题。

Conclusion: 该轻量级模型不仅实现了高效的模态转换，还成为验证显微镜工作流中实验准确性和图像保真度的实用工具。

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Motivation: 为了促进时空图像融合方法的应用，需要解决不同传感器图像空间和光谱分辨率不匹配的问题。

Method: 第一种方法基于传统上采样技术；第二种是ABSIS锐化方法，将高分辨率图像的整体特征与特定低分辨率图像的独特属性相结合。

Result: 两种方法都显著提高了USTFIP时空融合方法的准确性，其中锐化方法将融合图像的光谱和空间精度分别提高了49.46%和78.40%。

Conclusion: 提出的标准化方法，特别是ABSIS锐化方法，能有效提升时空图像融合的性能和准确性。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Conclusion: FlexiReID框架有效解决了多模态行人重识别中模态组合灵活性的问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,
infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive
mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex

Conclusion: QFCA方法在保持高精度的同时实现了实时性能，解决了现有纹理异常检测方法在实际部署中的瓶颈问题

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

Motivation: 全监督医学图像分割需要大量像素级标注，成本高昂且耗时。为减轻标注负担，探索仅使用四个极值点作为弱监督标注的可行性。

Method: 1. 使用极值点生成边界框作为SAM2提示，产生初始伪标签；2. 改进FGEPM算法，结合蒙特卡洛dropout不确定性估计构建梯度不确定性代价图进行边界追踪；3. 引入双分支不确定性感知尺度一致性损失和边界框对齐损失确保空间一致性和精确边界对齐。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督框架在超声图像分割中具有有效性和实用性，为医学图像分析提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians'
intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized
multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic
sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across
diverse real-world scenarios. Key contributions include detailed annotations of
3D body joint positions synchronized with fisheye camera images, as well as
accurate 3D pedestrian positions extracted from lidar data, facilitating robust
benchmarking for perception algorithms. We release a portion of the dataset
along with a comprehensive benchmark suite, featuring evaluation metrics for
accuracy, efficiency, and scalability on embedded systems. By addressing
real-world challenges such as sensor occlusions, dynamic environments, and
hardware constraints, this dataset offers a unique resource for developing and
evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms in pedestrian detection, 3D pose
estimation and 4D trajectory and intention prediction. Additionally, we provide
baseline performance metrics using custom neural network architectures and
suggest future research directions to encourage the adoption and enhancement of
the dataset. This work aims to serve as a foundation for researchers seeking to
advance the capabilities of intelligent vehicles in near-field scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态视觉Transformer自编码器(MViT-AE)的无监督异常检测方法，用于脑肿瘤分割，无需依赖标注数据，在BraTS-GoAT 2025数据集上取得了有临床意义的肿瘤定位效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑肿瘤分割中标注数据有限、成本高和不一致的问题，提供一种可扩展的无监督替代方案。

Method: 使用多模态视觉Transformer自编码器，仅用健康脑部MRI训练，通过重建误差图检测肿瘤；采用多模态早期-晚期融合策略和集成Segment Anything Model的后处理流程。

Result: 在测试集上获得病变级Dice相似系数：全肿瘤0.437、肿瘤核心0.316、增强肿瘤0.350；验证集异常检测率达到89.4%。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的无监督模型有潜力成为神经肿瘤影像学中可扩展、标签高效的工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了UniMedVL，首个医学统一多模态模型，能够在单一架构中同时处理图像理解和生成任务，解决了现有医学AI系统在数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学AI系统将图像理解和图像生成分开处理，导致数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力方面的不足，无法满足医疗诊断应用对统一处理多模态输入和多样化输出的需求。

Method: 采用观察-知识-分析(OKA)范式：观察层构建UniMed-5M数据集；知识层提出渐进式课程学习；分析层开发UniMedVL统一多模态模型。

Result: 在5个医学图像理解基准测试中表现优异，在8种医学成像模态的生成质量上与专业模型相当，且统一架构实现了双向知识共享。

Conclusion: 将传统分离的能力整合到单一医学框架中，能够在多样化的医学视觉语言任务中实现跨领域改进。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DGME-T方法，通过引入方向网格运动编码来增强视频Swin Transformer，显著提升了在档案影片和现代视频上的相机运动分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有相机运动分类模型在档案影片上性能下降的问题，因为档案影片存在噪声、缺失帧和低对比度等挑战，会模糊运动线索。

Method: 构建统一基准数据集，并提出了DGME-T方法，在Video Swin Transformer基础上通过可学习的归一化后期融合层注入基于光流的方向网格运动编码。

Result: DGME-T将骨干网络的top-1准确率从81.78%提升到86.14%，宏观F1从82.08%提升到87.81%（现代视频）；在二战档案影片上准确率从83.43%提升到84.62%，宏观F1从81.72%提升到82.63%。跨域研究显示在现代数据上进行中间微调可将历史性能提升超过5个百分点。

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验和transformer表示是互补的，即使是一个小型、精心校准的运动头也能显著增强在退化影片分析中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Conclusion: Ditto框架成功解决了指令视频编辑的数据稀缺问题，建立的Ditto-1M数据集和Editto模型为该领域设立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

TL;DR: 提出SEGA方法，通过分层推理框架和从粗到细的策略解决内容感知布局生成问题，显著降低了复杂元素布局的失败率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏反馈式自校正机制，导致在复杂元素布局规划时失败率显著增加。

Method: 采用分层推理框架：粗粒度模块初步估计布局，细粒度模块对粗规划结果进行精细推理，并融入布局设计原则作为先验知识。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的结果，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SEGA方法通过分步演化范式显著提升了内容感知布局生成的性能，特别是在复杂布局场景下。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NDM框架，首个基于噪声的检测和缓解方法，用于识别和减轻文本到图像生成中的隐式恶意意图，同时保持模型生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I扩散模型容易生成不当内容，特别是面对隐式性暗示提示时。现有检测方法主要针对显式内容，无法有效检测隐式线索，而微调方法会损害生成质量。

Method: 利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发噪声检测方法；提出噪声增强自适应负向引导机制，通过抑制突出区域注意力来优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗数据集上验证，NDM性能优于现有SOTA方法（SLD、UCE、RECE等）。

Conclusion: NDM框架能有效检测和缓解隐式恶意意图，同时保持模型原始生成能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于超像素的正则化方法，用于在粗标注数据上训练语义分割模型，显著提升边界召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当获取精细像素级标注困难或昂贵时，粗标注成为替代方案，但边界对齐效果不佳。

Method: 在编码器-解码器架构中引入超像素上采样，通过SLIC超像素正则化鼓励分割结果与基于颜色和位置的超像素对齐。

Result: 在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上评估，边界召回率相比现有方法显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善了粗标注数据上的语义分割边界质量，为标注成本高昂的应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Motivation: 解决潜在扩散模型中高频细节保真度不足和罕见激活尖峰问题，提供无需训练或微调的稳定解决方案。

Method: 结合每样本微钳制（温和限制极端值）和自适应分位数裁剪（AQClip），AQClip可使用局部结构统计或注意力熵引导模式。

Result: 在低步数和超高分辨率下获得更干净、更锐利的结果，与CFG/Rescale有协同作用，能在不产生伪影的情况下使用更高引导强度。

Conclusion: QSilk是一个高效、无需训练的稳定层，在SD/SDXL骨干网络上均能提供一致的定性改进，计算开销可忽略不计。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型存在输入到概念映射偏差和有限的可控性，这限制了其实际价值，直接损害了基于概念方法的责任策略。

Method: 引入过滤器分组损失和联合概念监督，自动将视觉特征分组为语义上有意义的组件，无需区域标注，改善视觉模式与概念之间的对齐。

Result: 在三个多样化数据集上的实验表明，LDCBM实现了更高的概念和类别准确率，在可解释性和分类性能方面都优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过将概念建立在视觉证据基础上，该方法克服了先前模型的基本限制，增强了可解释AI的可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

Conclusion: ReCon框架有效解决了生成数据增强中的内容位置不匹配和语义泄漏问题，为训练鲁棒感知模型提供了高质量的数据增强方案。

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决非刚性变形点云序列配准中的两个关键挑战：(i) 由于配准目标的非凸性导致的局部最小值问题，特别是在噪声或部分输入下；(ii) 长序列中的误差累积导致跟踪失败。

Method: 采用可扩展的数据驱动方法，通过两阶段管道预测变形图序列：首先估计帧级粗粒度图节点进行鲁棒初始化，然后在滑动窗口方式下随时间细化其轨迹。

Result: 在DeformingThings4D和D-FAUST数据集上优于先前最先进方法，相比先前最佳方法实现了4倍以上的加速，提供了显著的效率提升。

Conclusion: ERNet能够有效处理噪声和部分输入，同时利用时间信息进行准确一致的序列配准，在精度和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

Conclusion: VISTA通过多代理迭代自改进方法，在视频生成质量方面显著优于现有方法，能够持续提升生成结果

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到最先进的平均mIoU性能，特别在包含多类别的图像上表现优势，仅引入单个辅助损失函数且无额外参数。

Conclusion: 神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中具有有效性，能够通过空间关系约束提升分割一致性。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

TL;DR: 3DPR是一个基于图像的重新光照模型，利用从光舞台捕获的多视图单光一次(OLAT)图像学习生成先验，结合预训练生成头部模型的几何先验，实现高质量的人脸重新光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张人像图像渲染新颖的重新光照视图是一个高度欠约束的问题。传统图形学方法通过可微分渲染分解为几何、材质和光照，但受限于底层模型的假设和近似。

Method: 首先将输入人像嵌入预训练生成头部模型的潜在空间，然后使用基于三元平面的反射率网络合成高质量的OLAT图像，最后根据HDRI环境图组合生成物理准确的环境重新光照结果。

Result: 3DPR在定量和定性评估中优于先前方法，特别是在保持身份特征和捕捉光照效果（如高光、自阴影和次表面散射）方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合生成几何先验和光舞台训练的反射率网络，能够从单张输入图像生成高质量的重新光照结果，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

TL;DR: Memory-SAM是一个无需训练、无需人工提示的舌像分割方法，通过检索历史案例自动生成有效提示来指导SAM2模型，在真实世界条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督模型需要大量标注数据，而SAM系列模型需要人工提示。本文旨在开发无需训练和人工干预的自动舌像分割方法。

Method: 使用DINOv3特征和FAISS检索构建小型记忆库，通过掩码约束对应关系从检索样本中提取前景/背景点提示，指导SAM2进行分割。

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上测试，Memory-SAM达到mIoU 0.9863，显著优于FCN(0.8188)和检测器到框的SAM基线(0.1839)，在真实世界条件下表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: 检索到提示的方法能够实现数据高效、鲁棒的舌像不规则边界分割，无需人工干预或模型微调。

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

TL;DR: OmniVinci是一个开源的多模态大语言模型项目，通过创新的模型架构和数据管道，在视觉和音频模态的跨模态理解方面表现出色，使用更少的训练数据实现了优于Qwen2.5-Omni的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推进机器智能需要发展跨多模态的感知能力，模仿人类感知世界的方式。

Method: 提出了三个关键创新：(i) OmniAlignNet用于在共享多模态潜在空间中增强视觉和音频嵌入的对齐；(ii) 时间嵌入分组用于捕捉视觉和音频信号之间的相对时间对齐；(iii) 约束旋转时间嵌入用于在多模态嵌入中编码绝对时间信息。构建了生成2400万单模态和多模态对话的数据管道。

Result: OmniVinci在DailyOmni（跨模态理解）上比Qwen2.5-Omni高出19.05分，在MMAR（音频）上高出1.7分，在Video-MME（视觉）上高出3.9分，仅使用0.2T训练token，比Qwen2.5-Omni的1.2T减少了6倍。

Conclusion: 不同模态在感知和推理中相互增强，OmniVinci在机器人、医疗AI和智能工厂等下游应用中展示了多模态优势。

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动原生图像生成技术的前沿发展，探索统一文本到图像生成和图像编辑的单一架构，并验证关键见解对模型性能的影响。

Method: 采用自回归+扩散混合架构：自回归模型首先生成基于多模态输入的离散图像标记，其隐藏状态作为扩散模型的调节信号来生成高保真图像。

Result: 在多个文本到图像生成和图像编辑基准测试中，BLIP3o-NEXT实现了优于现有模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 架构选择的关键在于可扩展性和快速推理能力；强化学习能推动原生图像生成；图像编辑仍具挑战但可通过后训练和数据引擎改进；数据质量和规模决定模型性能上限。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物医学视觉语言模型的临床应用受到限制，因为提示优化技术要么产生不可解释的潜在向量，要么产生单一文本提示，缺乏透明度且无法捕捉临床诊断的多方面性质。

Method: 利用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，通过进化框架自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro始终优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在数据稀缺的少样本设置中。发现的提示与统计显著的临床特征具有强语义对齐。

Conclusion: 通过生成多样化的可解释提示集合，BiomedXPro为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，是开发更可信和临床对齐AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

<details>

Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，但在存在相关预测因子的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: TangledFeatures框架识别相关特征组中的代表性特征，减少冗余同时保持解释能力，所选特征子集可直接应用于下游模型。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上应用该框架预测主链扭转角，所选特征对应于结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释这些角度的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures相比传统选择技术提供了更可解释和稳定的分析基础，在相关特征空间中表现出有效性。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

TL;DR: 提出了基于期望Sarsa的C51改进算法(ES-C51)，替代原C51的贪婪Q学习更新，使用softmax结合所有动作信息，在奖励期望相似但分布不同的情况下提高稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于价值的RL算法只估计期望奖励，而分布强化学习(DRL)估计完整的奖励概率分布。C51是流行的离散动作空间DRL算法，但使用贪婪Bellman更新在动作期望奖励相似但分布不同时会导致不稳定问题。

Method: 将C51的贪婪Q学习更新替换为期望Sarsa更新，使用softmax计算结合所有可能动作的信息，而不是依赖单一最优动作。同时将标准C51的探索策略从ε-greedy改为softmax作为对比基准(QL-C51)。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏上评估，ES-C51在多个环境中表现优于QL-C51。

Conclusion: 基于期望Sarsa的C51改进算法能有效解决动作期望奖励相似但分布不同时的不稳定问题，学习到更高性能的策略。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

Conclusion: AlignFlow作为一种即插即用组件，能够有效改进流生成模型的训练效果，适用于大规模数据集和复杂模型架构。

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

TL;DR: 提出了IQNN-CS，一个可解释的量子神经网络框架，用于多类别信用风险分类，结合了变分量子神经网络和专门为结构化数据设计的解释技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信用评分是金融服务中的高风险任务，需要透明和可信的模型，但量子机器学习(QML)的黑盒特性阻碍了其在需要透明度的领域中的应用。

Method: 使用变分量子神经网络(VQNN)结合后解释技术，引入了跨类别归因对齐(ICAA)指标来量化不同预测类别间的归因差异。

Result: 在两个真实信用数据集上的评估显示，IQNN-CS具有稳定的训练动态、有竞争力的预测性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: 为金融决策中的透明和可问责QML模型提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出了SPA框架，通过自监督微调学习世界模型，然后用于策略优化，显著提升LLM智能体在分布外场景中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在分布外场景中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与环境动态对齐。传统强化学习训练在这种条件下难以扩展，探索能力脆弱且泛化能力有限

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模两个组件，通过自监督微调阶段冷启动策略，学习与环境交互的世界模型，然后在策略优化前使用该模型模拟未来状态

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等多样化环境中显著提升性能，例如将Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升到59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升到70.9%

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型可以更好地将推理与环境动态对齐，改进决策能力，SPA框架简单有效，大幅提升了基于RL的智能体训练性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了多层级可配置时变马尔可夫决策过程（MCTVMDP），其中智能体不仅可以通过底层动作与环境交互，还能通过上层动作主动修改环境动态模型本身，从而提升长期奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境是给定或固定的，但实际中智能体可能通过主动修改环境动态来获得更高奖励。本文研究智能体如何通过模型修改动作来重构底层转移过程。

Method: 引入MCTVMDP框架，包含上层MDP用于配置策略，下层MDP具有可配置的非平稳转移函数。智能体需要联合优化上层配置策略和下层原始动作策略。

Result: 提出了一个能够处理主动环境修改的强化学习框架，智能体可以通过模型修改动作来改变环境动态。

Conclusion: MCTVMDP为研究智能体主动修改环境动态的问题提供了理论框架，扩展了传统强化学习的被动适应范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

TL;DR: Antislop框架通过采样器、自动化管道和FTPO微调方法，有效检测和消除LLM输出中的重复短语模式，在保持性能的同时显著减少slop现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛采用导致输出中出现特征性的重复短语模式（称为slop），这会降低输出质量并使AI生成文本容易被识别。

Method: 结合三种创新方法：Antislop采样器（推理时抑制不需要的字符串）、自动化管道（分析模型特定slop并生成训练数据）、FTPO微调方法（在单个token级别调整logits）。

Result: 成功抑制8000+个模式，FTPO实现90%的slop减少，同时在GSM8K、MMLU和创意写作任务中保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: Antislop框架能有效减少LLM输出中的重复模式，而不会损害模型性能，优于传统的DPO方法。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种基于物理信息数据驱动预测模型和统计方法的两光子光刻(TPL)机器健康监测方法，能够有效处理不同泛化性水平的复杂场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TPL系统维护主要依赖经验而非机器健康监测，导致维护时机不当——要么维护不及时造成停机和质量问题，要么过度维护导致效率低下和可避免的停机时间。

Method: 通过整合物理信息数据驱动的结构尺寸预测模型与统计方法，提出了三种能够处理不同泛化性水平复杂场景的监测方法。收集了包含6种工艺参数组合和6种结构尺寸在两种机器健康状态下的综合实验数据集进行评估。

Result: 在所有测试场景中，所提方法均实现了高精度，表现出优异的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 这些结果代表了向TPL系统基于状态的维护迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

*Sami Davies,Benjamin Moseley,Heather Newman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个在线相关聚类算法，能够在AOS模型中同时近似所有ℓp范数目标，将离线环境中的"全范数"保证成功迁移到在线设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于发现离线环境中可以同时近似所有ℓp范数，但标准随机顺序在线模型存在根本性分离：ℓ1范数可轻松近似，而ℓ∞范数需要至少Ω(n^{1/3})的竞争比，这凸显了需要超越最坏情况模型的必要性。

Method: 提出了一种在AOS模型中的单一算法，给定输入的一小部分作为样本，生成一个聚类，能够同时高概率地O(log⁴n)竞争所有ℓp范数，高概率地O(logn)竞争ℓ∞范数，期望下O(1)竞争ℓ1范数。

Result: 算法在AOS模型中实现了：对所有ℓp范数高概率O(log⁴n)竞争比，对ℓ∞范数高概率O(logn)竞争比，对ℓ1范数期望下O(1)竞争比。同时证明了标准RO模型中ℓ∞范数需要至少Ω(n^{1/3})竞争比。

Conclusion: 成功将离线"全范数"保证迁移到在线世界，证明了AOS模型的有效性，并通过下界分析表明所获得的ℓ1和ℓ∞范数竞争比在AOS模型中接近最优。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归和基于扩散的方法在预测PDE控制的高维动力学时存在累积误差和离散化伪影问题，限制了长期物理一致性预测。流匹配提供了一种高效的确定性采样替代方案。

Method: 提出TempO模型，利用稀疏条件化和通道折叠技术，结合时间条件化傅里叶层来高效处理3D时空场，捕获多尺度模式。

Result: 在三个基准PDE数据集上优于最先进的基线方法，谱分析显示能更好地恢复多尺度动力学，效率研究表明相比基于注意力或卷积的回归器具有更少的参数和内存需求。

Conclusion: TempO通过流匹配方法实现了高效、高保真的PDE动力学预测，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

TL;DR: DLER通过改进RL优化方法，使用简单的截断长度惩罚，在保持高准确率的同时大幅缩短输出长度，实现了最优的准确率-效率平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理语言模型虽然性能强大，但输出过长，需要提高每个token的智能密度（准确率相对于响应长度）。

Method: 提出DLER训练方法，结合批量奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单截断长度惩罚，解决RL优化中的三个关键挑战：优势估计偏差、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号。

Result: DLER将输出长度减少70%以上，同时超越所有先前基线的准确率，在7B模型上相比DeepSeek-R1-7B准确率提高28%且延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER证明了通过改进RL优化而非复杂惩罚机制，可以实现高效的准确率-效率平衡，并提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Conclusion: 这是实现机械通气优化和个性化的关键步骤，为基于经验和博弈论元素的MV决策模拟提供了发展路径

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，通过数据依赖的低通滤波处理多模态和重尾分布，计算高效且无需过多调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在大离散支撑集上估计多模态和重尾概率质量函数的问题，传统方法在处理这类复杂分布时存在局限性。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯算子扰动），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间进行平滑估计。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾数据上，该方法能保持粗粒度结构同时抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简短、计算可靠、内存效率高，适合自动化流水线和大规模探索性分析，但存在已知的失效模式（如突然的不连续性）。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

Motivation: 研究全球恐怖主义数据库(GTD)中恐怖主义事件周计数的短期预测，为GTD事件预测提供透明且超越基线的参考方法。

Method: 构建可复现的预测流程，使用固定时间分割，评估双向LSTM(BiLSTM)与季节性朴素方法、线性/ARIMA模型和深度LSTM-Attention基线的性能。

Result: BiLSTM在测试集上达到RMSE 6.38，相比LSTM-Attention提升30.6%，相比线性滞后回归基线提升35.4%，在MAE和MAPE指标上也有并行改进。

Conclusion: 长期历史数据训练模型泛化能力最佳；适中的回看窗口(20-30周)提供强上下文；双向编码对捕捉窗口内的累积和后续模式至关重要；短期结构特征贡献最大。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Motivation: 神经网络在训练过程中如何自适应调整内部表示的特征学习机制仍缺乏理论理解，需要建立可处理的数学框架来分析这一过程。

Method: 使用统计物理方法推导出贝叶斯后验的自洽均值场理论，分析随机梯度朗之万动力学训练的两层非线性网络，并在基本理论基础上引入自增强输入特征选择机制。

Result: 在无限宽度下理论退化为核岭回归，有限宽度下预测到对称性破缺相变；基本均值场理论定性地预测了特征学习的出现，但低估了泛化改进；加入自增强特征选择机制后能定量匹配学习曲线。

Conclusion: 自增强输入特征选择是特征学习的关键机制，改进后的均值场理论为理解神经网络特征学习提供了机制性洞见。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and

*Conor Rowan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出测地线问题是深度Ritz方法的理想应用场景，并通过三个数值实验验证了这一观点，为科学机器学习研究开辟了新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测地线问题在物理和工程中普遍存在，但科学机器学习社区对此关注较少。作者认为测地线问题具有简单的几何结构、变分结构和自然非线性，特别适合深度Ritz方法。

Method: 采用深度Ritz方法解决测地线问题，通过三个数值实验进行验证：路径规划、光学和固体力学中的案例。

Result: 实验结果表明深度Ritz方法在测地线问题上表现良好，验证了该方法在此类问题中的适用性。

Conclusion: 测地线问题是深度Ritz方法的一个有前景的应用方向，为未来科学机器学习研究提供了富有成果的研究路径。

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段模型，通过整合临床和影像信息来改善髋部骨折风险预测，相比传统工具DXA T-score和FRAX具有更高的敏感性和更少的漏诊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统髋部骨折风险评估工具如DXA T-score和FRAX敏感性不足，容易漏诊高风险人群，特别是无既往骨折史或骨量减少的患者。

Method: 采用顺序两阶段模型：第一阶段使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量进行筛查，第二阶段整合DXA影像特征进行精炼预测。基于MrOS、SOF和UK Biobank数据集开发。

Result: 模型经过内部和外部验证，在不同队列中表现一致且适应性强。相比T-score和FRAX，两阶段框架实现了更高的敏感性和更少的漏诊病例。

Conclusion: 该两阶段模型提供了一种成本效益高且个性化的早期髋部骨折风险评估方法，能够更准确地识别高风险人群。

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过全面实证研究发现Mahalanobis距离方法在OOD检测中并非普遍可靠，定义了理想的数据表示几何结构，并提出径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法，通过可调参数控制特征空间的径向几何，显著提升OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Mahalanobis距离方法在OOD检测中广泛应用，但表示几何和归一化对其性能的影响尚未被充分理解，这限制了其下游应用。

Method: 在多种图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案上进行全面实证研究，分析表示几何与OOD性能的关系，并提出径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法。

Result: 研究发现Mahalanobis方法并非普遍可靠，光谱和内在维度指标能准确预测模型OOD性能，径向缩放归一化能显著提升OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过连接表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的关联，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ReasonIF基准来评估大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，并通过推理指令微调(RIF)方法提升了指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令对于可控性、透明性和安全性至关重要，但现有研究主要关注模型主要响应的指令遵循，而忽略了推理过程。

Method: 构建ReasonIF基准，包含多语言推理、格式和长度控制等6类指令提示；探索多轮推理和推理指令微调(RIF)两种增强策略。

Result: 现有开源LRMs指令遵循得分低于0.25；任务难度增加时指令遵循进一步恶化；RIF将GPT-OSS-20B的IFS从0.11提升至0.27。

Conclusion: 推理指令遵循是LRMs的重要能力维度，现有模型表现不足，RIF方法能有效提升但仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

*Xuansheng Wu,Xiaoman Pan,Wenlin Yao,Jianshu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLM在强化学习可验证奖励（RLVR）后的推理性能差异源于预训练模型的微观特性——声音感知能力。通过引入声音感知水平（SAL）指标，揭示了模型区分可靠知识与不可靠知识的内在能力与其推理潜力直接相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么不同基础模型在RLVR后的推理性能差异如此显著，寻找预训练模型的微观特性与推理能力之间的关联。

Method: 将推理形式化为Horn子句链，使用跨层稀疏自编码器提取特征，估计特征间转移概率，并用LLM对规则进行语义可靠性分类，引入SAL指标量化分布分离程度。

Result: 发现高潜力模型具有内在的声音感知能力，其内部概率分布在不同的可靠性级别上系统性地变化，而弱模型则对可靠性不敏感。SAL指标与后RLVR推理性能呈强相关（R^2=0.87）。

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力与其预训练阶段形成的区分可靠与不可靠知识的内在能力密切相关，这为选择和设计更强的基础模型提供了基于内部机制的实际指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

TL;DR: 使用MIMIC-III数据库中的214名脑膜炎患者和46,303名非脑膜炎患者数据，通过集成学习方法构建脑膜炎诊断模型，在模拟急诊室场景的测试集上获得优异性能。

Motivation: 为开发能够在真实急诊室场景中应用的脑膜炎AI诊断工具，模拟现实临床环境创建具有挑战性的诊断条件。

Method: 采用两阶段特征选择流程，选择性别和高风险ICD编码等临床相关特征，使用随机森林、LightGBM和深度神经网络作为基础模型，通过集成学习将基础模型输出堆叠到逻辑回归元模型中。

Result: 集成学习模型在两个测试集上均表现优异，测试集1的AUC为0.9637，测试集2的AUC为0.9472。

Conclusion: 虽然直接部署临床可用的诊断工具仍具挑战性，但本研究为未来基于集成学习的AI驱动脑膜炎诊断方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

Method: 将乘积系数与自编码器表示相结合，使用KNN分类器进行分类，并逐层添加乘积系数来分析其对性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，更丰富的系数集合能系统性地提高类别可分性和整体准确率，该方法在多个基准测试中均优于PCA基线和先前框架。

Abstract: This work extends our previous study on enhancing 3D LiDAR point-cloud
classification with product coefficients
\cite{medina2025integratingproductcoefficientsimproved}, measure-theoretic
descriptors that complement the original spatial Lidar features. Here, we show
that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient
features with autoencoders to push LiDAR classification performance further.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了熵正则化信任衰减方法，用于处理分布漂移下的序列决策问题，通过应力感知的指数倾斜来更新信念和决策，实现了O(√T)的动态遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在分布漂移环境下的序列决策问题，传统方法在分布变化时性能下降，需要开发能够适应分布变化的鲁棒决策方法。

Method: 使用熵正则化信任衰减，在信念更新和镜像下降决策中注入应力感知的指数倾斜，建立了Fenchel对偶等价性，并提出了参数无关的对冲策略来自适应未知漂移。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性边界，在KL漂移路径长度ST下实现了Õ(√T)的动态遗憾保证，信任衰减实现了O(1)的每切换遗憾，而无应力更新会导致Ω(1)的尾部风险。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，提供了一个单一的应力自适应更新方法，并扩展到二阶更新、老虎机反馈、异常值处理等多个场景。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

Motivation: 由于金融应用的高风险和高利害关系特性，在现实世界金融应用中应用LLM仍然具有挑战性，需要专门的可信度评估基准。

Method: 开发FinTrust基准测试，基于实际情境设计广泛的对齐问题，并为每个可信度评估维度提供细粒度任务，评估了11个LLM模型。

Result: 专有模型如o4-mini在大多数任务（如安全性）中表现更好，开源模型如DeepSeek-V3在特定领域（如行业级公平性）有优势，但所有模型在信托对齐和披露等具有挑战性的任务中都表现不佳，显示出法律意识的显著差距。

Conclusion: FinTrust可以作为金融领域LLM可信度评估的有价值基准，当前LLM在法律意识方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

Conclusion: TESSERA通过统一专家混合模型多样性与保形校准，提供了可信赖、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现管道中的选择性预测和下游决策制定。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Conclusion: Transformer架构在禽类疾病监测中具有巨大潜力，能够支持早期预警系统，实现及时干预和预防策略。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely
intervention and prevention strategies.

### [122] [DRO-InstructZero: Distributionally Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15260)
*Yangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过将零样本提示优化构建为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布的模糊集，并采用鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用，从而在分布偏移下实现可靠的提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型对提示措辞高度敏感，但现有的自动提示搜索方法（如InstructZero）在分布偏移和对抗性评估下性能下降，因为它们仅优化单一评估分布下的期望性能，导致提示在不同设置间难以迁移。

Method: 将零样本提示优化构建为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布的模糊集，采用鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用，同时保持贝叶斯搜索的查询效率。

Result: 在形式化重写任务中，准确率从61.3%提升至85-90%，绝对增益约25-30个百分点；在代码调试任务中，领域偏移下获得约25个百分点的增益；稳定任务（如因果推理）保持96%以上准确率，表明对分布内案例无损失。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习相结合，提供了一种即插即用的通用方法，在现实世界不确定性下实现可靠、可迁移的提示对齐。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，解决了μP在稳态训练中学习率传递失效的问题，实现了跨宽度的零超参数迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代尺度不变架构中，训练很快进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层造成反向尺度敏感性，使得有效学习率变得宽度依赖，破坏了μP的学习率传递能力。

Method: 引入权重衰减缩放规则：对于矩阵类参数，学习率η₂∝d⁻¹，权重衰减λ₂∝√d；对于向量类参数，η₁=Θ_d(1)，λ₁=0。结合奇异值谱分析，保持子层增益宽度不变。

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了该规则，实现了学习率和权重衰减的零样本迁移，消除了每个宽度都需要调参的需求。

Conclusion: 通过显式控制优化器设定的稳态尺度，将μP扩展到近初始状态之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

TL;DR: RIC-TSC框架将因果发现融入时间序列分类，在格陵兰冰上湖演化预测中，因果模型比相关性基线在分布外评估中准确率提升12.59%，展示了因果建模在地球观测中的泛化优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时空地球观测模型依赖纯相关性特征，在异质域间迁移能力差。因果建模能发现稳定不变关系，提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化性，但在地球观测中潜力未充分发挥。

Method: 提出RIC-TSC框架，将滞后感知因果发现(J-PCMCI+)嵌入序列建模，使用多模态卫星数据识别区域特定和不变预测因子，将验证的预测因子及其时间滞后输入轻量级分类器。

Result: 在两个对比融化季节的1000个手动标记湖泊平衡基准上，因果模型在分布外评估中比相关性基线准确率最高提升12.59%。

Conclusion: 因果发现不仅是特征选择手段，更是构建可泛化、机制基础的地球表面动态过程模型的途径。

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督回归中的伪标签方法相对较少被探索，与分类不同，回归涉及连续输出和异方差噪声，难以评估伪标签可靠性，导致错误累积和过拟合。

Method: 采用不确定性感知的伪标签框架，通过双层优化联合最小化所有数据的经验风险和优化不确定性估计，以增强标记数据的泛化能力。

Result: 在多个基准半监督回归数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法具有更优越的鲁棒性和性能。

Conclusion: 该不确定性感知伪标签框架有效缓解了不可靠伪标签的影响，为半监督回归提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/sxq/Heteroscedastic-Pseudo-Labels.

Result: 识别了基础模型在科学发现中的风险和未来方向，支持科学界理解其变革性作用。

Conclusion: 基础模型正在催化科学范式的转变，需要社区反思科学发现的未来，并提供了相关项目资源。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

Motivation: 集合数据同化方法在非线性动态问题中表现优异，但面临分析精度与计算效率的权衡，大集合规模虽能提高精度但计算成本高。

Method: 使用较小集合规模的EnKF生成初步分析状态，然后通过全连接神经网络学习并预测校正项，弥补因集合规模限制导致的性能下降。

Result: 在Lorenz系统和非线性海洋波场模拟实验中，新方法在相同集合规模下比传统EnKF获得更高精度，且额外计算成本可忽略。

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法能有效提升数据同化精度，适应性强，可与不同模型和集合数据同化方法结合应用。

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Conclusion: DFCA突出了其在动态现实世界去中心化网络中的鲁棒性和实用性，为处理异构客户端数据提供了有效的去中心化解决方案。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

Motivation: 研究RFLAF模型的泛化特性，通过改进采样方案来减少所需的特征数量，提高模型效率。

Method: 采用数据依赖的杠杆加权采样方案，提出寻找近似核的算法来学习加权RFLAF。

Result: 通过加权采样，MSE损失情况下的特征数边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε)^{1/t})，当Gram矩阵有限秩时甚至可达到Ω(1)。Lipschitz损失情况从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε²)^{1/t})。

Conclusion: 加权RFLAF在显著减少特征数量的情况下仍能达到相同性能，验证了理论的有效性。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Conclusion: MoE架构为图神经网络提供了一种可扩展的统一防御框架，能够有效应对多种类型的对抗攻击。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 谱均值流方法为序列建模提供了新的算子理论视角，通过张量网络分解和流匹配实现了可扩展的学习和快速采样。

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Conclusion: BREEZE通过同时增强学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量，有效提升了零样本RL的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available

Result: 实验表明SWFP在多种机器人控制基准测试中展现出增强的稳定性、效率和优越的适应性能。

Conclusion: SWFP提供了一种高效算法，能够稳定地微调预训练流策略，具有训练子模型更简单/更快、计算/内存成本降低以及基于Wasserstein信任区域的可证明稳定性等优势。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电解质研究面临两个基本挑战：缺乏高质量标准化基准，以及对混合物系统中几何结构和分子间相互作用的建模不足。

Method: 首先重组并增强了CALiSol和DiffMix电解质数据集，加入分子几何图表示；然后提出GeoMix框架，包含专门设计的几何交互网络(GIN)模块，用于保持Set-SE(3)等变性。

Result: GeoMix在两个数据集上始终优于多种基线方法（包括MLP、GNN和几何GNN），验证了跨分子几何相互作用和等变消息传递对准确性质预测的重要性。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅为电解质研究建立了新基准，还提供了一个通用的几何学习框架，可应用于能源材料、药物开发等领域的混合物系统建模。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的闭式Transformer公式不仅解释了'深度信念'，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Conclusion: RPC方法通过理论指导的混合策略有效解决了现有测试时缩放方法的局限性，在减少推理错误和降低计算成本方面表现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are
available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

Method: 将最大似然训练重新表述为潜变量和联合流形分布上的鞍点问题，使用耦合Wasserstein梯度流进行内部更新，交替进行过阻尼Langevin更新和随机参数上升。

Result: 在标准平滑性和耗散性假设下证明了存在性和收敛性，在KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离上获得衰减率，ELBO比受限摊销后验获得的界限更紧。

Conclusion: 该方法在物理系统数值近似上表现良好，与可比方法竞争性相当。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设演示者属于低复杂度策略类，但在实际中奖励模型可能具有低基数特性，这需要更弱假设的新学习方法。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文赌博机中的离线模仿学习，基于奖励模型在低基数类中的假设，设计了一种样本复杂度与奖励类基数对数相关的新算法。

Result: 证明了似然最大化方法在低基数奖励模型情况下会失败，而新方法能够以对数样本复杂度成功学习。

Conclusion: 当从正确演示中学习时，需要超越传统的似然最大化方法，考虑奖励模型的低基数特性。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Conclusion: 该方法在避免对抗性训练不稳定性的同时，在反事实预测任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Conclusion: OffSim框架能够有效地从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励函数，并在离线设置中成功训练策略，为减少强化学习中手动设计工作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在训练大型语言模型时存在探索不足和熵崩溃问题，模型倾向于利用狭窄的解决方案集，导致采样多样性丧失，阻碍性能进一步提升。

Method: SESA框架采用顺序采样方法，首先生成多样化的解决方案草图，然后将这些草图扩展为完整的推理路径。通过将每个新输出条件化于之前的输出，确保整个过程的多样性。

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和从崩溃中恢复方面始终优于传统RL方法。在三个智能体基准测试中，SESA将成功率分别提升了+0.25、+0.42和+0.07（相对于基线RL最高达到211%的相对改进）。

Conclusion: SESA为探索提供了一种结构化方法，为RL训练的大型语言模型实现更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用PMI的线性结构，而理论研究表明跨模态最优相似度度量应对应点互信息。

Method: 利用再生核希尔伯特空间的内积来近似PMI，提出KME-CLIP方法。

Result: 理论上证明该方法能以任意精度逼近PMI，实证表明在多个检索和分类任务中整体优于标准CLIP。

Conclusion: KME-CLIP通过更好地利用PMI的线性结构，有效改进了多模态对比预训练框架的相似度计算机制。

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即Transformer组件（如非线性激活和归一化）本质上是非单射的，可能阻止从模型表示中精确恢复输入。

Method: 数学证明Transformer语言模型的单射性，在六个最先进语言模型上进行数十亿次碰撞测试，并开发SipIt算法实现从隐藏激活中高效重构输入文本。

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用属性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MC Dropout不确定性在脑肿瘤MRI分割中与分割错误的相关性较弱，特别是在肿瘤边界区域，表明该方法在医学图像分割中定位边界错误的能力有限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MC Dropout不确定性估计在脑肿瘤MRI分割中识别分割错误的有效性，特别是在肿瘤边界区域

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置下进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算MC Dropout不确定性，并与像素级错误进行Pearson和Spearman相关性分析

Result: 全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05），不同增强方法间的差异虽有统计学意义但缺乏实际相关性

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性在定位边界错误方面提供有限线索，医学图像分割需要替代或混合的不确定性估计方法

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了战略双重稳健（SDR）估计器，将战略均衡建模与双重稳健估计相结合，用于战略环境中的因果推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由战略代理行为引起的内生处理分配问题，在保持双重稳健性的同时纳入战略考量。

Method: 整合战略均衡建模与双重稳健估计框架，在战略无混杂条件下进行因果推断。

Result: 理论分析确认SDR的一致性和渐近正态性；实证评估显示SDR优于基线方法，偏差减少7.6%-29.3%，在不同战略强度和代理规模下保持稳健可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为代理对干预做出战略响应时的可靠因果推断提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework
that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation
for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous
treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double
robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis
confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic
unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance
over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying
strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations.
The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when
agents respond strategically to interventions.

*Edward Tansley,Estelle Massart,Coralia Cartis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了神经特征假设(NFA)的理论证明，证明了在平衡初始化条件下，L层线性网络的NFA指数为1/L，并发现对于非线性激活网络存在反例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度神经网络的特征学习机制是建立数学基础的重要开放问题，神经特征假设(NFA)提供了分析特征学习的新视角。

Method: 使用梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化，理论分析多层线性网络的训练动态，并通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 证明了L层线性网络在平衡初始化下NFA指数为1/L，发现非线性网络存在NFA不成立的反例，不平衡初始化下需权重衰减才能渐进满足NFA。

Conclusion: NFA在深度线性网络中具有深度依赖性，但在非线性网络中可能不成立，这为理解深度网络特征学习提供了新的理论洞见。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力增强的联合图神经网络(Attn-JGNN)模型，用于解决#SAT问题，显著提高了求解精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受迭代联合图传播(IJGP)算法启发，旨在通过神经网络方法改进#SAT问题的求解准确性。

Method: 使用树分解将CNF公式编码为联合图，在图上进行迭代消息传递，通过学习划分函数来近似模型数量，并在联合图的簇内和簇间应用注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明Attn-JGNN模型相比其他神经网络方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 注意力机制使模型能更关注概率推理中的关键变量和簇，减少冗余计算，从而提高了#SAT问题求解的准确性。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

*Jiahao Zhou,Chengliang Lin,Dingji Li,Mingkai Dong,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRATING是一个无需训练的高效推理系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝和内存优化技术，显著降低语义Top-K选择任务的延迟和内存使用，在保持精度的同时提升边缘设备上的部署效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义Top-K选择在边缘AI服务中延迟和内存需求过高，但实际只需要相对排名而非精确分数，且中间层存在序列级稀疏性，为优化提供了机会。

Method: 提出整体前向传播和GRATING系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝减少延迟，采用双层滑动窗口和分块执行策略重叠I/O与计算来限制峰值内存使用。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的reranker上测试，GRATING在微基准测试中延迟降低达89.0%，峰值内存减少达94.9%，在三个真实应用中延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，内存减少18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING通过利用相对排名和序列级稀疏性，实现了显著的效率提升，增强了边缘设备上AI服务的部署可行性。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

*Parsa Abbasi,Stefan Heindorf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CQD-SHAP是一个基于Shapley值的可解释性框架，用于分析复杂查询回答中各个查询部分对特定答案排名的贡献，解决了现有神经符号方法缺乏查询部分重要性解释的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的复杂查询回答方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏用户信任。虽然神经符号方法如CQD允许跟踪中间结果，但无法解释查询不同部分的重要性。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的Shapley值，计算每个查询部分对特定答案排名的贡献，满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 自动化评估显示，该方法在必要性和充分性解释方面有效，与多种基线方法相比，对大多数查询类型都表现出色。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP提供了一种可解释的框架，能够量化神经预测器从不完整知识图谱中推断新知识的价值，超越了仅依赖现有事实的符号方法。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算子学习方法忽视PDE的领域知识，导致难以捕捉时间动态和训练时间范围外的泛化问题。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构：编码器空间离散化输入函数，神经ODE捕捉潜在时间动态，解码器重构物理空间解。提出物理编码的神经ODE来融入PDE特定物理特性。

Result: 在非线性扩散-反应和Navier-Stokes方程上的数值实验显示高精度、计算效率和在训练时间范围外的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能适应多种编码器/解码器，并能跨相关PDE族泛化，具有作为可扩展、物理编码的科学机器学习工具的潜力。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin Machine在资源受限设备上具有高速推理潜力，其逻辑驱动操作适合在现代CPU架构上并行执行，因此需要优化实现来充分利用这一特性。

Method: 采用指令级位运算实现紧凑模型表示和加速处理；引入基于AND子句评估的提前退出机制避免不必要计算；提出文字重排序策略最大化提前退出概率，通过统计分析和Tsetlin自动机行为在训练后推理前阶段应用。

Result: 在ARM处理器上的gem5模拟器实验显示，优化实现相比传统基于整数的TM实现减少了高达96.71%的推理时间，同时保持相当的代码密度。

Conclusion: 提出的位运算优化、提前退出机制和文字重排序策略能显著提升Tsetlin Machine的推理效率，使其更适合资源受限设备的部署。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CarBoN（校准最佳N采样）框架，通过自适应校准模型参数来改进推理任务中的测试时缩放效率，无需重新训练大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法（如Best-of-N采样）在N增加时存在收益递减问题，效率低下。

Method: 两阶段方法：先探索解空间，然后通过学习输入特定的温度T和加性偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成更可靠的推理路径。

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024上的实验表明，CarBoN效率提升显著，达到相同准确率所需的rollout次数减少4倍，且在固定预算下通常获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: CarBoN框架有效提升了测试时缩放的效率，温度T和偏移向量δ在平衡输出多样性和正确性方面发挥互补作用，该框架也可推广到束搜索等步级采样策略。

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乘法自由模型如DLGNs在训练时计算成本高，且难以扩展到更多输入的逻辑块，需要更高效的梯度学习方法。

Method: 使用Walsh变换辅助的概率查找表方法，通过梯度学习逻辑门组合，大幅减少可训练参数数量。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上比DLGNs收敛显著更快，同时保持相当的准确率。

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs为现代FPGA上的高效部署和实时科学应用提供了潜力，可扩展到更高输入逻辑块。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

Motivation: 传统有限元方法分析IPMSM转子形状计算成本高，需要开发更高效的替代方法。

Method: 开发自定义深度学习模型KS-Net，并与多种传统机器学习算法比较，使用9000样本数据集和10折交叉验证。

Result: Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM实现100%准确率，KS-Net达到99.98%准确率，仅两个误分类。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法能高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为电机设计加速、自动化转子识别和故障诊断提供基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是一种通过专家迭代和强化学习训练的模型，能够自动简化Lean证明，无需人工监督，显著压缩证明长度并提高验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经定理证明生成的证明虽然经过形式系统验证，但过于冗长，难以理解且限制了数学洞察力。现有方法在处理RL训练证明器生成的极长证明时效果不佳，且缺乏训练数据。

Method: 通过专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer模型，使用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号，在推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流程逐步减少证明长度。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ProofOptimizer显著压缩了证明长度：miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，Seed-Prover的IMO 2025证明减少49%。简化后的证明在Lean中验证更快，且作为训练数据能进一步提升下游证明器性能。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督就能简化Lean证明的语言模型，有效解决了证明简化的关键瓶颈问题，为数学定理证明提供了更实用的工具。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

Motivation: 现有通用对抗扰动方法忽视领域特定的特征关系约束，导致生成的对抗样本不现实或易被检测，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出约束对抗扰动(CAP)算法，使用基于梯度的交替优化策略解决增强拉格朗日最小最大优化问题，强制执行多个复杂约束。

Result: 在金融、IT网络和网络物理系统等多个领域，CAP实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时显著减少了运行时间。

Conclusion: CAP方法能有效处理约束特征空间中的对抗攻击，并可从数据中学习特征约束，适用于具有结构化输入空间的广泛领域。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于自动机的偏好学习框架，用DFA生成的偏好替代显式奖励函数，解决具有复杂历史依赖奖励结构的强化学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理具有复杂历史依赖奖励结构的环境时面临挑战，需要手动设计奖励函数，这既困难又容易出错。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机(DFA)生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，包括静态方法（直接使用学习到的奖励函数进行策略优化）和动态方法（通过迭代更新持续优化奖励函数和策略）。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中的实验表明，该方法在处理时间依赖任务时优于传统奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法，如奖励机器和LTL引导方法。

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好方法为处理非马尔可夫奖励提供了可扩展、高效且无需人工干预的替代方案，并具有收敛保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

*Nayan Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文评估了图神经网络(GNN)和3D U-Net作为参数化工字梁有限元分析(FEA)替代模型的表现，发现GNN明显优于U-Net，其中消息传递神经网络(MPNN)和图变换器表现最佳，物理信息神经网络(PINN)框架显著提升了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限元分析计算成本高，不适合设计优化问题，需要寻找深度学习模型作为替代方案，但选择合适的架构来准确模拟FEA是一个挑战。

Method: 使用图神经网络(GNN)和3D U-Net作为FEA替代模型，引入基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络(PINN)框架，采用课程学习策略（先预训练再物理信息微调）来稳定训练。

Result: GNN明显优于U-Net，最差的GCN框架相对L2误差为8.7%，而最佳U-Net为13.0%。MPNN和图变换器表现最佳，相对L2误差分别为3.5%和2.6%。PINN显著改善泛化能力，在高信号任务上误差降低达11.3%。

Conclusion: 虽然图变换器最准确，但推理速度比MPNN慢37.5%。PINN增强的MPNN提供了最实用的解决方案，在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

TL;DR: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)方法，通过自适应混合策略改进基于神经崩溃的持续学习方法，同时提升模型校准度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注减轻遗忘和提高准确率，但忽视了网络校准这一重要方面。神经崩溃现象在持续学习中具有优势，但很少有工作专门改进持续学习模型的校准能力。

Method: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)方法，这是一种针对神经崩溃方法定制的自适应混合策略。SAMix根据神经崩溃下特征空间的几何特性调整混合过程，确保更稳健的正则化和对齐。

Result: 实验表明SAMix显著提升性能，在持续学习中超越最先进方法，同时改进模型校准。SAMix提高了跨任务准确率和预测的可靠性。

Conclusion: SAMix是持续学习系统的一个有前景的进展，能够同时增强准确性和预测可靠性。

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，限制了其在需要处理多变量数据和协变量的真实场景中的适用性。

Method: 采用组注意力机制，通过在相关时间序列组内高效共享信息来实现上下文学习；通过在单变量序列上施加多样化多变量结构的合成数据集进行训练。

Conclusion: Chronos-2的上下文学习能力使其成为可在真实世界预测管道中直接使用的通用预测模型。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

TL;DR: 研究发现DiLoCo优化器的有效性主要来自对伪梯度应用Nesterov动量，提出了SNOO优化器，在非分布式设置下实现1.5-2.5倍计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展需要更高效的优化技术，Lookahead系列优化器采用双循环框架，DiLoCo在非分布式设置中表现出色，但其有效性的原因尚不明确。

Method: 提出Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO)，在Lookahead框架中对伪梯度应用Nesterov动量，与各种内部优化器兼容，计算和内存开销最小。

Result: SNOO在非分布式设置中实现1.5-2.5倍计算因子增益，训练规模达1e23 FLOPs，模型规模越大改进越明显。

Conclusion: SNOO是一种实用的优化器增强方法，兼容模型分片，可应用于包括AdamW和Muon在内的各种内部优化器。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

Conclusion: 混合求解器成功平衡了传统求解器和优化代理，实现了可解释的速度-最优性权衡，为优化代理的实际部署提供了可信解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Method: 构建OpenEstimate基准测试，包含需要综合大量背景信息并以概率先验形式表达预测的数值估计任务，评估这些先验的准确性和校准度。

Result: 在六个前沿语言模型上的评估显示，模型产生的概率先验通常不准确且过于自信，性能仅随不确定性诱导方式略有改善，但不受采样策略、推理努力或提示设计的显著影响。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台，并为开发更好的概率估计和不确定性推理模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

TL;DR: 该论文认为AGI进展受理论限制而非数据或规模限制，提出基于批判理性主义的因果力学框架，强调假设空间变化作为核心操作，通过结构原则使错误发现和修正变得可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战柏拉图表示假说，指出仅凭观测充分性无法保证干预能力，因为观测等价的世界在干预下可能产生分歧，需要转向以错误为中心的范式。

Method: 提出因果力学框架，将假设空间变化作为首要操作，引入局部性和自主性原则、独立因果机制和组合自主性原则等结构原则，提供可操作的诊断方法。

Result: 建立了使错误发现和修正可行的理论框架，能够将不可达错误转化为可达错误并进行修正。

Conclusion: AGI发展需要理论突破，因果力学为构建能够主动发现和修正错误的智能系统提供了理论支架。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要反映群体共识，缺乏对个体推理风格和信念轨迹的捕捉能力，需要开发能够模拟人类个体推理的AI系统。

Method: 采用双轨设计：合成轨道用于大规模系统压力测试，人类轨道提供生态有效的"出声思考"推理数据，评估模型在预测个体推理和信念更新方面的能力。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM在适应个体推理方面仍存在持续差距，HugAgent成为首个可扩展的基准测试。

Conclusion: HugAgent为对齐机器推理与人类个体思维提供了首个可扩展的基准测试框架，推动了更人性化AI推理的发展。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as
HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking

Motivation: 解决真实工作环境中大规模、长期情绪识别数据集稀缺的问题，特别是在自然办公环境下的情感计算挑战。

Method: 收集38名员工30.5个月的面部表情数据，使用深度学习进行面部表情识别，计算7种情绪概率和32种扩展情绪指标，包括效价、唤醒度、波动性等。

Result: 数据集成功复现已知心理模式（周末效应：效价提升192%，p<0.001），员工离职预测AUC=1.0，基线实验情绪分类准确率91.2%，效价预测R2=0.84。

Conclusion: 这是目前公开可用的最大、最长期的工作场所情绪数据集，为情绪识别、情感动态建模、情绪传染等研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估应基于稳态属性簇理论，采用因果中心性权重和跨会话持久性测试，以减少评估的脆弱性和可操纵性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估存在两个问题：对称权重假设所有领域同等重要，而人类智能研究表明并非如此；快照测试无法区分持久能力和脆弱表现。

Method: 提出两种电池兼容的扩展：基于CHC理论的因果中心性权重评分，以及包含剖面持久性、持久学习和错误纠正的簇稳定性指数家族。

Result: 这些扩展保持了多领域广度，同时减少了脆弱性和可操纵性，提供了无需架构访问的黑盒测试协议。

Conclusion: 通用智能应被理解为稳态属性簇，AGI评估应重视能力的因果中心性和跨扰动持久性，这为更稳健的评估提供了理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动探索分析方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为多维数据分析提供了新思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个基于经验驱动的学习框架，通过构建状态-动作知识图谱来解决无API环境下GUI智能体的效率瓶颈问题，显著提升了探索效率和策略深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，智能体只能通过像素级GUI进行操作。在这种无API环境下，基于大语言模型的智能体面临严重效率瓶颈：局限于局部视觉体验，做出短视决策，依赖低效的试错方法，阻碍了技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 提出KG-Agent框架，将智能体的原始像素级交互结构化到持久的状态-动作知识图谱(SA-KG)中。通过链接功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态，形成丰富的经验邻域。设计了基于图谱拓扑的混合内在奖励机制，结合状态价值奖励和探索新颖性奖励。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂的开放式GUI决策环境中进行评估，相比最先进方法，在探索效率和策略深度方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过经验图谱化有效解决了无API环境下智能体的探索效率和长期规划问题，将战略规划与纯发现解耦，使智能体能够有效评估具有延迟回报的设置动作。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AUGUSTUS系统通过图结构多模态上下文记忆和概念驱动的检索方法，在多模态智能体系统中取得了显著的性能提升和效率优势。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and

unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and

Motivation: 当前多模态模型的监督微调数据质量不足，存在事实错误和幻觉问题，主要原因是视觉感知能力不足。

Method: 利用视觉识别模型(RAM++)和OCR系统提取视觉先验，结合三个LMM模型评估原始答案，通过统计融合得到共识分数作为真实标签，训练轻量级评论模型，最后选择得分最高的答案作为精炼结果。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据微调的模型性能优于使用原始数据的模型，尤其在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升多模态模型的监督微调数据质量，评论模型在保持高效的同时展现出与先进LMM相当的能力。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上，DEPO实现了序列长度减少39%，减少了低效token中的过度推理路径，同时在整体准确率上优于基础模型。

Conclusion: DEPO框架有效解决了大推理模型在简单任务上的过度推理问题，显著降低了推理成本，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种修正性目标的概念，确保AI在训练过程中不会抵抗目标更新或关闭，并介绍了一种将任何可修正目标转化为修正性版本的方法，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI训练过程中，部分学习的目标会激励AI避免进一步的目标更新，因为继续追求当前目标通常能更好地实现目标。这种抵抗行为会阻碍训练收敛、错误修正和人类偏好变化，构成安全风险。

Method: 首先形式化定义修正性目标，然后引入一种转换方法，通过短视地获取在无成本阻止更新情况下的奖励预测来构建任何可修正目标的修正性版本。该方法可递归扩展到修正性代理创建的新代理，并防止代理故意修改其目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验表明，这些修正性目标可以被有效学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 修正性是一个关键的安全属性，本文提出的方法可以在不牺牲性能的情况下实现修正性目标，为解决AI训练中的抵抗问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

Motivation: 虽然强化学习在单智能体任务中有效提升了推理能力，但在多轮次、多智能体场景中的扩展仍未被充分探索，主要挑战包括长时程信用分配和智能体特定的优势估计。

Method: MARS框架包含回合级优势估计器来对齐学习信号进行信用分配，以及智能体特定的优势归一化来稳定多智能体训练。通过自博弈在合作和竞争游戏中学习。

Result: 从Qwen3-4B训练的MARS智能体在保留游戏中性能提升达28.7%，在推理基准测试中多智能体系统性能持续提升，集成到领先多智能体系统后在AIME上提升10.0%，GPQA-Diamond上提升12.5%。

Conclusion: 在策略游戏中使用自博弈进行端到端RL训练是开发LLM中可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code
and models are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MARS.

*Pavan C Shekar,Ashwanth Krishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive Minds是一个将LoRA适配器作为领域专用工具的智能代理系统，通过基础LLM作为语义路由器动态选择最相关的LoRA工具，实现按需切换领域专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决单一微调模型或基于规则的固定路由在领域适应性方面的局限性，需要一种能够灵活切换不同领域专家的智能系统。

Method: 使用LangGraph进行工作流管理，让基础LLM作为语义路由器分析查询并动态选择最相关的LoRA适配器工具，结合多智能体编排和参数高效微调。

Result: 系统能够提供准确、专业化的响应，同时保持对话能力，支持API和Web接口，完全开源。

Conclusion: Adaptive Minds提供了一个可扩展和可扩展的领域自适应AI助手基础，结合了多智能体编排的灵活性和参数高效微调的高效性。

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and
extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance.

*Boyin Liu,Zhuo Zhang,Sen Huang,Lipeng Xie,Qingxu Fu,Haoran Chen,LI YU,Tianyi Hu,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding,Dongbin Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个检测和解决强化学习中判断不一致性的框架，包括冲突检测率(CDR)指标和去冲突图奖励(DGR)方法，显著提升训练稳定性和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临判断不一致性问题，这会破坏强化学习的稳定性。虽然之前研究关注判断准确性，但逻辑一致性特别是偏好循环等关键问题尚未得到充分解决。

Method: 提出包含两个主要贡献的框架：CDR指标量化判断冲突，DGR框架在策略优化前通过移除循环来净化信号。DGR构建偏好图，将其转换为无冲突的有向无环图，生成逻辑一致的奖励信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架相比强基线显著提升了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈中一个关键且现在可管理的维度。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MM-HCAN多模态超图对比注意力网络，用于鲁棒的感应电机多故障诊断，在三个真实基准测试中达到99.82%准确率，具有强跨域泛化能力和抗噪性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，局限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，且在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降，需要更可靠的故障诊断方案。

Method: MM-HCAN将对比学习集成到专为多模态传感器融合设计的超图拓扑中，联合建模模态内和模态间依赖关系，超越欧几里得嵌入空间增强泛化能力。

Result: 在三个真实基准测试中达到99.82%准确率，具有强跨域泛化能力和抗噪性，能够同时诊断轴承、定子和转子故障。

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为工业环境中的全面多故障诊断提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，支持预测性维护和延长资产寿命。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

*Jiayuan Bai,Xuan-guang Pan,Chongyang Tao,Shuai Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个用于Text-to-SQL任务中候选查询选择的新框架，通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-SQL任务面临语义模糊性和复杂组合推理的挑战，现有选择方法（如自一致性或最佳N解码）只能提供浅层信号，容易导致不一致评分、脆弱推理链，并且无法捕捉密切相关的SQL候选项之间的细粒度语义差异。

Method: JudgeSQL开发了一个基于推理的SQL判断模型，通过强化学习在可验证奖励的指导下提炼推理轨迹，实现准确且可解释的判断。在此基础上，加权共识锦标赛将显式推理偏好与隐式生成器置信度相结合。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出优越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化能力以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制重新定义了SQL候选项选择，提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

*Lavanya Umapathy,Patricia M Johnson,Tarun Dutt,Angela Tong,Madhur Nayan,Hersh Chandarana,Daniel K Sodickson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个机器学习框架，通过整合患者历史就诊信息来改进健康监测，特别是在就诊次数有限且频率不固定的情况下。该模型首先基于最近一次就诊数据评估初始疾病风险，然后利用历史影像和临床生物标志物信息进行修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中的时间背景对于评估患者健康状况随时间变化至关重要。当患者历史就诊次数有限且频率不固定时，整合这些时间背景信息可以显著改善健康监测效果。

Method: 模型分两步：1) 使用最近一次就诊的医学数据估计初始疾病风险；2) 利用之前收集的影像和/或临床生物标志物信息来完善风险评估。应用于前列腺癌风险预测，使用了28,342名患者近十年的数据。

Result: 整合历史背景信息直接将假阳性转化为真阴性，在保持高灵敏度的同时提高了特异性。整合最多三次历史影像检查信息时，假阳性率从51%降至33%，加入临床数据后进一步降至24%。预测五年内前列腺癌风险时，假阳性率从64%降至9%。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息提供了相关背景，可增强医学风险预测的特异性。对于多种进展性疾病，通过背景信息充分降低假阳性率，可为低基线风险的大规模人群扩展纵向健康监测项目，实现早期检测和改善健康结果。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了SciRecipe数据集和Thoth模型，通过"草图-填充"范式和结构化奖励机制，显著提升了科学实验协议生成的完整性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型生成的科学实验协议往往不完整或不一致，限制了其在可重复科学研究中的实用性。

Method: 引入SciRecipe数据集（12K+结构化协议），提出"草图-填充"范式分离分析、结构和表达，采用基于组件的奖励机制评估步骤粒度、行动顺序和语义保真度，并通过分阶段的知识到行动过程训练Thoth模型。

Result: Thoth在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源LLM，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面实现显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够有效连接知识与实验执行。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF方法假设统一的标注者偏好并依赖二元比较，忽视了人类评估者的多样性和成对反馈的局限性，需要更有效的偏好学习和个性化对齐方法。

Method: 1) 将偏好学习与计量经济学文献联系，证明二元比较不足以识别潜在用户偏好；2) 开发EM-DPO方法发现潜在标注者类型并训练混合LLM；3) 提出基于最小最大遗憾公平准则的聚合算法。

Result: 证明了三个或更多响应的排序能确保可识别性，提出的方法能够处理异质性偏好并生成具有公平性保证的单一生成策略。

Conclusion: 建立了一个理论和算法框架，用于在生成模型对齐中实现多样用户的公平性和个性化，解决了RLHF中的关键限制问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and

evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and

Motivation: 多模态方法在帕金森病评估中表现良好，但存在两个主要限制：训练时需要同步所有模态，推理时依赖所有模态。

Method: 将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，TRIP在异步设置下比最佳基线高出16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，在同步设置下高出4.86和2.30个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIP框架在帕金森病评估中实现了最先进的性能，展示了其有效性和适应性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

<details>

Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂多维问题中缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制的问题。

Method: 使用结构化对话框架，结合记忆、自我反思和策略约束的上下文编辑，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Result: 对话训练后的代理在Elo评分、标准化Bradley-Terry-Davidson能力和AlphaRank质量上优于基线模型，反思能有效识别弱点并塑造后续陈述。

Conclusion: 基于对话的上下文演化是在开放不可验证领域中实现针对性专业知识放大的实用路径。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Result: 结合临床指南和高质量系统评价的RAG配置始终优于单一指南方法和大规模文献数据库。

Conclusion: 对于新兴疾病，基于精选二次评价的检索在狭窄共识文档和未过滤原始文献之间提供了最佳平衡，支持临床决策同时避免信息过载和过度简化指导。

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research
agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and
synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow
retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce
PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified
reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability.
PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from
AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward
signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction
adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further
enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool
failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This
highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce
efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents. The model and inference
code is open-sourced under MIT license at

### [206] [Fix False Transparency by Noise Guided Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15736)
*Aly El Hakie,Yiren Lu,Yu Yin,Michael Jenkins,Yehe Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出NGS方法解决3DGS中不透明物体重建时出现的虚假透明表面问题，通过在训练过程中注入不透明噪声高斯来鼓励表面高斯采用更高不透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS重建的不透明物体常出现虚假透明表面，导致在交互式观看时背景和内部图案不一致。这是由于3DGS优化过程中缺乏对表面不透明度的显式约束。

Method: NGS策略在训练期间向物体体积中注入不透明噪声高斯，仅需对现有splatting过程进行最小修改。还提出了基于透射率的度量来量化虚假透明度。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，NGS显著减少了虚假透明度，同时在标准渲染指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: NGS有效解决了3DGS中的虚假透明伪影问题，是首个明确识别、表征并解决该问题的方法。

Abstract: Opaque objects reconstructed by 3DGS often exhibit a falsely transparent
surface, leading to inconsistent background and internal patterns under camera
motion in interactive viewing. This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization
in 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via
alpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a
photometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface
opacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque
regions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is
difficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly
evident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although
other causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false
transparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this
artifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages
surface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians
in the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to
the existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency
in static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the
severity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality
object-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we
augment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically
designed to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false
transparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially
reduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on
standard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.
